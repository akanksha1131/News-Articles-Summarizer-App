Researchers at New Mexico Tech ’s Institute of Mining and Technology, located in Socorro, New Mexico, have embarked on an innovative project to create drones and robots modelled after deceased birds . These ""animatronic"" bird drones, currently still in the testing phase, aim to improve wildlife monitoring by providing a less intrusive, more natural way of studying birds and other animals. The project has gained attention for its unique approach to wildlife observation, and it addresses some of the limitations associated with traditional drone technology.The main goal of these bird-inspired drones is to observe wildlife without disturbing their natural behaviour. Traditional drones often make a lot of noise, which can frighten animals and cause them to flee. For instance, when monitoring large animals like elephants in Africa, the noise from drones can be loud enough to startle the animals, leading to them scattering or becoming stressed. By creating drones that mimic the appearance and movement of birds, the researchers aim to overcome this issue and observe animals in a more natural and discreet way.Mostafa Hassanalian, the lead researcher and mechanical engineering professor at New Mexico Tech, explained that these bird-like drones could be an important tool for studying animal behaviour, such as bird formations, communication, and other ecological dynamics. The ability to blend in with real wildlife means that these drones would be less likely to disrupt the animals they are meant to observe, allowing for more accurate and less biassed data collection.The research team has developed several prototypes of ""zombie birds,"" which are essentially robotic birds made from the preserved bodies of deceased animals. These robots are designed to replicate the appearance and movement of real birds in order to blend in with live wildlife. Here are the three main types of bird-like robots created so far:One of the prototypes is a drone equipped with flapping wings, designed to imitate a real bird’s flight. The researchers used a taxidermied pheasant’s head and wings to create the flapping-wing drone. This bird-like drone is intended to blend in with real pheasants and mimic their natural behaviour in the wild. By using taxidermied birds, the team ensures the drone has a realistic look and movement pattern that can be difficult to distinguish from living birds in the environment.In addition to the flapping-wing drone, the researchers have also developed two versions of robotic mallard ducks: one that can fly and another that can swim.This drone is modelled after the pheasant prototype, with a similar design that includes flapping wings. It is intended for observing birds in flight and studying their patterns and behaviours from the air.Unlike the flying version, this robot is designed to replicate the natural swimming movements of a mallard duck. It features special robotic feet that glide smoothly through water, allowing the robot to move in a way that mimics a real duck. This version is particularly useful for studying aquatic life and observing ducks and other waterfowl in their natural habitat.The team’s latest creation involves a stationary pigeon designed to look like a real bird but with the added capability of carrying a camera in its neck. This pigeon robot can provide real-time video feeds or broadcast footage, making it a valuable tool for remote surveillance or wildlife observation. The camera-equipped pigeon can be placed in natural environments, allowing researchers to monitor animal activity without the need for human presence, which could potentially disturb the ecosystem.One important aspect of this research is that all the birds used in these projects were already deceased before being repurposed. Hassanalian emphasised that they are not using live animals for this purpose, ensuring that no harm is done to wildlife. Instead, they are recycling birds that have already passed away, which makes the research more ethical and sustainable. This approach also highlights the potential of reusing materials that would otherwise go to waste, giving a new life to the preserved bodies of animals.While the current focus of the research is on improving wildlife monitoring, there are potential future applications for this technology, including in the field of surveillance. The ability to create lifelike, nature-inspired robots could make them useful in various areas where traditional drones might be too conspicuous or disruptive. For example, in surveillance applications, these ""zombie birds"" could be deployed to observe public spaces or areas with wildlife in a manner that is less intrusive and more unobtrusive.In the future, these robotic birds could also play a role in studying endangered species or remote ecosystems, where human presence might be limited or harmful to the environment. The technology could further evolve to incorporate more advanced sensors, autonomous navigation, and AI capabilities, enabling even more sophisticated forms of ecological research and surveillance.","Researchers at New Mexico Tech are developing drones and robots modelled after deceased birds.

Biggest technology IPO after Paytm

When can Swiggy employees sell their shares

Flipkart's $1.4-1.5 billion payout to employees

Swiggy’s IPO, scheduled to debut on November 13, is expected to create substantial wealth for its employees. The food and grocery delivery giant’s IPO is anticipated to be one of the largest wealth-generating events in India’s startup landscape,The IPO will unlock Rs 9,000 crore in employee stock options (ESOPs), marking a significant milestone in wealth creation. With this move, Swiggy is positioned as a major player in India’s startup ecosystem, following in the footsteps of companies like Flipkart.The company's ESOP payout will be among the top in India's startup scene, rivaling Walmart-owned Flipkart's massive $1.4-1.5 billion payout.Swiggy’s Rs 11,300-crore IPO would be the biggest technology company's public offering since the Paytm IPO in 2019. The issue was subscribed 3.6 times. Retail investors subscribed to their portion 1.14 times, while the portion reserved for employees saw 1.65x bidding. The stock is set to debut on November 13. Swiggy’s public issue was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The company had set a price band of Rs 371-390 apiece for the IPO.According to an Economic Times report, Swiggy founders and employees in the top management were allocated Esops worth nearly Rs 2,600 crore in its latest stock ownership plan. These include founder and group CEO Sriharsha Majety; cofounders Nandan Reddy and Phani Kishan Addepalli; chief financial officer Rahul Bothra; chief technology officer Madhusudhan Rao; food marketplace CEO Rohit Kapoor; and newly appointed CEO of Swiggy Instamart, Amitesh Jha.An exemption on the mandatory one-year lock-in period, secured by Swiggy from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in July this year means that employees are allowed to sell shares a month after the IPO.According to Swiggy’s prospectus, the company has rolled out three Esop plans so far—one each in 2015, 2021 and 2024. This aggregates to a pool of almost 230 million shares. Of these, 9 million options have been exercised into shares, while the remaining are yet to be exercised.Ecommerce major Flipkart has conducted Esop buybacks aggregating to $1.5 billion across various tranches over the years. In 2023, Flipkart made a one-time payout of $700 million to current and former employees as part of its separation from PhonePe, when the payments firm moved domicile from Singapore to India. Billed as one of the largest liquidity events for employees by a local internet firm, it topped the $500 million bonanza for employees when Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018.","Swiggy’s Rs 11,300-crore IPO would be the biggest technology company's public offering since the Paytm IPO in 2019.

LG announces world's largest stretchable display: All details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lg-announces-worlds-largest-stretchable-display-all-details/articleshow/115225209.cms,"What are stretchable displays



How this prototype is better than the previous one



LG’s largest-ever foldable display prototype is now official. The company announced the existence of the world's first stretchable display which is capable of expanding up to 50%. This is the highest rate of elongation in the foldable display industry. The Korean company demonstrated the panel during a meeting at LG Science Park in Seoul with more than 100 South Korean industry, academia, and research participants involved in a stretchable display national project.Stretchable displays are seen as the ultimate free-form foldable screen technology because they can be freely transformed into any shape. This includes stretching, folding and twisting. LG’s prototype features a 12-inch screen that stretches up to 18 inches, while simultaneously delivering a resolution of 100ppi (pixels per inch) and full red, green, and blue (RGB) colour.Earlier, in 2022, LG unveiled its first stretchable display prototype. However, the new panel's maximum elongation rate has more than doubled from 20% to 50%.The company said that it has improved the properties of a special silicon material substrate used in contact lenses and developed a new wiring design structure for the latest prototype. LG Display also claimed that this panel will offer more stretchability and flexibility, exceeding the original national project's target of 20% elongation.By using a micro-LED light source of up to 40μm (micrometres), the new prototype's strengthened durability means it can be repeatedly stretched over 10,000 times, maintaining clear image quality even in extreme environments such as exposure to low or high temperatures and external shocks, the company notes.The company also showcased numerous concepts where stretchable displays can be adopted, including an automotive panel that stretches out into a convex shape and can be operated by hand as well as a wearable display attached to firefighters' uniforms that provides real-time information.",LG Display has unveiled its largest-ever foldable display prototype.

YouTube’s latest update for Android may be buggy: What affected users claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtubes-latest-update-for-android-may-be-buggy-what-affected-users-claim/articleshow/115224332.cms,"What some users are saying about the bug

YouTube down for some users in India

YouTube app for Android recently got an update. Some users claim that the update has introduced frustrating bugs affecting playback and miniplayer functionality. The update, which rolled out on November 7, brought granular playback speed controls but also seems to have inadvertently introduced these glitches.As per a section of users, one bug is hampering the functionality of the miniplayer that disappears when positioned on the right side of the screen. They claim that the miniplayer exits the screen when dragged to the right edge, requiring them to tap the video thumbnail again to make it reappear, according to a report by Android Police.The second bug is said to be preventing video playback from resuming when the device is in portrait mode. Users have observed that after switching to full-screen landscape mode, pausing the video, and returning to portrait mode, playback cannot be resumed without returning to full-screen mode.While the exact cause of these bugs remains unclear, they appear to be linked to the latest update. For those affected by these bugs, rolling back to an older version of the YouTube app seems to provide a temporary solution.Meanwhile, YouTube users in India reportedly faced issues with the Google-owned video platform on the YouTube app as well as website. They claimed to be facing issues with the YouTube Play button. But the issue seems to have been resolved.According to DownDetector, approximately 56% of users experienced issues with video streaming, while 23% and 21% faced problems with server connection and the app, respectively. The issue with YouTube appears to be limited as most members of the Times of India Tech team did not report any problems with the YouTube app on Android and iOS or the website throughout the day.","YouTube app for Android recently got an update.

What next for Apple

The European Union (EU) has taken another action against Apple, ordering the tech giant to cease geo-blocking practices on its various media services, including the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.“Today, following a coordinated investigation at European level, the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network of national consumer authorities and the European Commission notified Apple of several potentially prohibited geo-blocking practices that the CPC Network has identified on certain Apple Media Services. The network requested Apple to align their practices with the EU's anti-geo-blocking rules,” said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, in a statement.Geo-blocking refers to the practice of restricting access to content based on a user's location. The Commission identified several instances of potentially illegal geo-blocking on Apple's platforms and threatened enforcement action by national regulators if the company fails to comply.“We are stepping up the fight against geo-blocking. No company, big or small, should unjustly discriminate customers based on their nationality, place of residence or place of establishment,” said European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .The CPC Network found a number of limitations on Apple Media Services, key elements of which are as follows:Online access: Apple Media Services have a different interface for different countries in the EU/EEA. In the app version of these services, consumers are only allowed to access the interface made for the country where they have registered their Apple account and face significant challenges when attempting to change this, which is not allowed under EU's anti-geo-blocking rules.Payment methods: When making paid purchases on Apple Media Services, consumers are only allowed to use means of payment (such as a credit/debit card) issued in the country where they registered their Apple account.Downloading: Since the App Store does not allow consumers to access the version of another EU/EEA country, consumers are not allowed to download the apps offered in other countries. Consumers should be able to download apps offered in other EU/EEA countries when they travel to or temporarily stay in that country.Apple now has one month to reply to the CPC Network's findings and propose commitments that will address the identified geo-blocking practices. Depending on Apple's reply, the CPC Network may enter into a dialogue with the company.","The EU has ordered Apple to cease geo-blocking practices on its various media services, including the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha Murthy, recently shared some insights from their lives. The couple were the star guests on the popular talk show The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show where they delighted the audience with candid, humorous stories from their personal lives.One of the show’s highlights was Narayana Murthy’s funny confession about forgetting their 25th wedding anniversary. He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went ‘In America this never happens!’, but I went ‘India main it happens though’, who can remember these things??”","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha, recently shared some insights from their lives.

Popular YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia , better known as BeerBiceps, has recently revealed a surprising incident from his early fitness journey. In a candid conversation on his YouTube channel, Allahbadia shared that he was once banned from a gym in Mumbai.In a recent interview with Kamiya Jani, founder of @curly.tales, he revealed that he was banned from a gym in Mumbai. Allahbadia revealed that he began his journey into content creation by sharing workout videos on YouTube. He filmed the initial content for his channel, BeerBiceps, at a gym in Wadala.To avoid the crowds, Allahbadia developed a routine of visiting the gym around 2 PM. He mentioned that with fewer people in the gym, he felt more comfortable and found it easier to record content for his channel.However, Allahbadia's growing popularity didn't sit well with the gym's trainers and he was banned from the gym. “The trainers were angry with me because I was growing. So, they banned me from the gym. I was very sad and upset,” said Allahbadia. He also revealed that the gym was later shut down.He also added that the incident proved to be a turning point in his career and he decided to set up his own home gym, which allowed him to continue his fitness journey without any restrictions.

Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga , is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos allegedly involving him in intimate encounters with multiple individuals. Originally investigated for alleged fraud, Engonga now faces public backlash and intensified scrutiny over his professional conduct and personal life. This controversy has sparked widespread reaction on social media and raised questions regarding ethics, public responsibility, and potential health risks associated with his actions. As the scandal unfolds, government authorities have initiated an official investigation, underscoring the increasing call for accountability among public officials in Equatorial Guinea.The scandal began when investigators, initially looking into Engonga for suspected fraud, reportedly discovered over 400 videos on his computer depicting private interactions with various individuals. These encounters allegedly involved multiple partners, including his brother’s wife, a cousin, and a relative of the President. According to sources, the videos were filmed in locations such as Engonga’s office, hotels, and even restrooms, with all recorded interactions believed to be consensual.Once leaked, the videos rapidly circulated across social media, sparking outrage and debate among citizens. Public response to the videos has varied, with many questioning the ethical standards of a high-ranking public official engaging in such activities, while others raised concerns about the privacy breach that led to the leak. Posts across social platforms criticised the conduct of a figure responsible for financial investigations, with some users highlighting the discrepancy between his public role and personal actions.In response to the viral scandal, Equatorial Guinea’s Attorney General’s Office, led by Anatolio Nzang Nguema, launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video leak. According to a spokesperson, authorities are assessing whether Engonga’s actions may have posed health risks, which could result in additional charges if confirmed.“If proven, he could face charges for endangering public health,” the spokesperson commented, emphasising that the investigation will extend beyond the videos themselves to assess any potential impact on public health.This probe into health risks marks a significant expansion of the investigation, as the Attorney General’s office examines both the privacy concerns involved in the leak and the broader implications of Engonga’s behaviour on public welfare. The investigation is expected to review the conduct of government officials and enforce measures to maintain accountability.In a public statement, Vice President Teodoro Nguema took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the scandal, emphasising the need for accountability among public officials. Nguema noted that government offices must be strictly reserved for official duties, signalling disapproval of the misuse of government resources and office spaces for personal purposes.Nguema announced that the government would be implementing new, stricter policies to ensure that misconduct within the administration is met with serious disciplinary action. He further stated that officials found guilty of misusing their authority or resources could face termination or other consequences as deemed appropriate. This stance reflects a broader governmental shift towards enforcing ethical standards and reinforces the message that public officials will be held responsible for their actions, especially when it comes to misuse of office privileges.Engonga, a married man and father of six, holds a prominent position at ANIF, leading financial investigations and initiatives against corruption. However, his involvement in the leaked videos has placed his career and reputation under intense public scrutiny. The scandal has opened a wider debate on the expectations placed on public officials, with many citizens questioning whether private conduct should impact public responsibility and ethical standards.As public opinion continues to weigh in, some have called for Engonga’s resignation, while others argue that privacy should protect personal matters unless they directly impact professional duties. The case has ignited a conversation on the balance between privacy and public accountability, particularly when it comes to those in leadership roles within the government.","Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency, Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos.

Train delivery personal to ensure safe food handling at every level

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has asked the e-commerce food business operators, including Swiggy , Zomato and BigBasket to ensure the minimum shelf life of their products. In a meeting convened with e-commerce food business operators (FBOs), it urged e-commerce FBOs to adopt best practices to ensure that food products delivered to consumers have a minimum remaining shelf life of 30% or 45 days before expiry.This measure aims to prevent the delivery of expired or soon-to-expire products, safeguarding consumer health and promoting responsible food handling practices. According to the food regulator, the meeting chaired by FSSAI CEO was attended by over 200 participants, both in-person and virtually.The CEO also cautioned FBOs against making misleading or unsupported claims online, emphasising the importance of accurate product information and transparency for consumers. He highlighted the crucial role of e-commerce platforms in protecting consumer health and fostering trust in digital food marketplaces.“He (the CEO) highlighted the pivotal role of online platforms in protecting consumer health and promoting transparency. He reiterated the mandate that no FBO can operate on any e-commerce platform without a valid FSSAI licence or Registration, emphasising the critical need for regulatory compliance,” the food regulator said.To ensure safe food handling throughout the delivery process, the CEO instructed FBOs to implement comprehensive training programs for delivery personnel, equipping them with essential food safety and hygiene protocols.He also stressed the importance of delivering food items and non-food items separately to prevent cross-contamination.According to a report, FSSAI also clarified that e-commerce platforms cannot bypass existing food safety norms to support 10-minute delivery services.","The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has asked the e-commerce food business operators, including Swiggy, Zomato and BigBasket to ensure the minimum shelf life of their products.

In a bid to challenge the dominance of US tech giants Google and Microsoft , search engines Ecosia and Qwant have announced a partnership to build an independent European search index , a report has said. The joint venture, called European Search Perspective (EUSP), aims to offer improved search results in French and German, with a planned launch in France in early 2025.Search engine Ecosia is a Germany-based search engine while Qwant is based out of France. As per a report by CNBC, the initiative comes as alternative search engines are facing challenges posed by their reliance on Google and Microsoft.Qwant and Ecosia have carved out niches with their focus on sustainability and privacy, respectively. While Qwant is a privacy-focused search engine that promises not to track users or resell their personal data, Ecosia’s focuses on sustainability.The companies are dependent on the infrastructure created by large tech companies like Microsoft but the EUSP joint venture seeks to change the reliance by building their own search index from scratch and offer a truly European alternative. The index will combine results from various search engines, prioritising user privacy and utilising Qwant's redesigned privacy-focused technology.The move is also said to be driven by concerns about rising costs and alleged geopolitical risks associated with relying on US tech infrastructure. Olivier Abecassis, CEO of Qwant, emphasised the importance of ""sovereignty of our business and companies.""He cited recent price hikes for Microsoft's Bing Search API as an example of the vulnerability that comes with dependence on external providers.Meanwhile, Christian Kroll, CEO of Ecosia, drew parallels to Europe's energy crisis following the Russia-Ukraine war, stressing the need to avoid over-reliance on any single country for critical resources, including technology.","Search engines Ecosia and Qwant have announced a partnership to build an independent European search index.

What is Google’s Flutter and how hackers are using it to target Mac users



How Mac users can stay safe from these apps



North Korean hackers have reportedly developed a new method to disguise malware within macOS apps that seem harmless. The hackers are reportedly using Google 's Flutter app development tool to bypass security measures. According to a report by AppleInsider, researchers at Jamf Threat Labs have discovered this tactic and highlighted the potential risks for Mac users.Flutter, a popular cross-platform development tool, allows for the creation of apps that function consistently across macOS, iOS, and Android. However, its unique code structure can obscure malicious code, making it difficult to detect through traditional security scans. Hackers are exploiting this code structure by embedding malware within Flutter apps, effectively hiding it from typical security checks.Researchers have discovered three variants of malware targeting macOS, each disguised within seemingly innocent apps built using different programming languages (Flutter, Go, and Python). These malware strains use sophisticated techniques to bypass security measures and establish connections with external servers suspected to be under North Korean control.One variant, hidden within a fake crypto exchange game built with Google's Flutter, downloads malicious scripts capable of remotely controlling infected Macs. Another variant, disguised as a notepad app, utilises confusing AppleScripts to achieve similar control.The malware's ability to execute remote AppleScript commands is particularly concerning, as it allows for unauthorised data collection and malware installation. The malicious scripts were even written backwards to evade detection, highlighting the advanced techniques employed by these hackers.While there's no evidence yet of these macOS malware apps being used in attacks, users should exercise caution, especially with cryptocurrency-related apps. Downloading apps from the Mac App Store, enabling stricter security settings in macOS, and keeping software updated can help mitigate risks. Be wary of apps promising unrealistic gains, as they may be malicious.","North Korean hackers have reportedly developed a new method to disguise malware within macOS apps that seem harmless.

Beijing's intellectual property court is hearing a case from Beijing Bodyreader Technology , which is seeking $420,000 in damages after its app was removed from the App Store in 2020.According to Bloomberg, closed-door hearings began Thursday and could conclude this week, representing the first time Apple has faced allegations from a Chinese developer regarding its standard mobile platform practices.The lawsuit echoes elements of Epic Games' landmark 2021 case against Apple. Bodyreader, which developed an app helping children improve posture, is challenging Apple's claim that the app engaged in ""dishonest"" behaviour. The developer argues that Apple demonstrated inconsistent enforcement by later approving an identical app under a different name.Among its demands, Bodyreader is seeking monetary compensation, an apology, and a court declaration that Apple engages in unfair monopolistic behaviour. The developer is also challenging Apple's standard 30% commission on virtual services and app purchases, requesting the court to mandate support for third-party app stores and external payment links.The case comes at a sensitive time for Apple as it balances maintaining its position in China's crucial market while adapting to the country's push to support domestic technology companies. The company faces growing competition from local smartphone makers like Huawei and has recently clashed with Chinese tech giants ByteDance and Tencent over payment options in their respective apps.","Beijing Bodyreader Technology is seeking $420,000 in damages after its app was removed from the App Store in 2020.

"FBI issues warning, exposes hackers’ new ‘emergency request’ tactic to target companies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fbi-issues-warning-exposes-hackers-new-emergency-request-tactic-to-target-companies/articleshow/115215502.cms,"What are “emergency data requests”

How to mitigate such threats

Strengthening third-party security:

Scrutinising EDRs:

Verifying identities:

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued a warning explaining how hackers are using new techniques to get access to data that is used to attack US-based companies and law enforcement agencies. In its notification, the intelligence service said that criminals impersonate law enforcement officials to obtain sensitive data through fraudulent “emergency data requests” (EDRs).EDRs are a legal mechanism that allows authorities to request information from companies in urgent situations without a warrant. FBI says that cybercriminals are exploiting this process for malicious purposes. Notably, EDRs are typically reserved for life-or-death situations, but hackers are leveraging them to bypass company safeguards and gain quick access to valuable data.“As of August 2024, FBI noted an uptick in criminal forum posts regarding conducting fraudulent emergency data requests and is releasing this notification for industry awareness. Cybercriminals are likely gaining access to compromised US and foreign government email addresses and using them to conduct fraudulent emergency data requests to US based companies, exposing the personal information of customers to further use for criminal purposes,” the 6-page notification said.In the Private Industry Notification, FBI highlights that there has been a surge in fraudulent EDRs, fueled by the increasing availability of compromised government credentials and information shared on online criminal forums. It gave an example of Lapsus$ extortion group, which reportedly pioneered the use of fraudulent EDRs to obtain sensitive information.“While the concept of fraudulent emergency data requests was previously used by other threat actors, such as Lapsus$, the increase in postings on criminal forums regarding the process of emergency data requests and sale of compromised credentials has led to an increase of their use,” FBI noted.More recently, a cybercriminal was observed offering ""high-quality .gov emails"" for sale on an online forum, explicitly advertising their use for EDR fraud and providing guidance on impersonating law enforcement officials.The FBI has provided a list of mitigation strategies that companies can implement to protect themselves. These include:Companies should enhance security measures for all external and remote connections to their systems.Be wary of requests that emphasise urgency or contain inconsistencies or signs of manipulation.Implement robust identity verification procedures to confirm the legitimacy of EDRs.Meanwhile, individuals are also urged to remain vigilant about data breaches and monitor their financial accounts for any suspicious activity.","FBI says cybercriminals are using ""emergency data requests"" to obtain sensitive data.

The government is reportedly planning to introduce restrictions on the import of laptops, tablets, and personal computers starting in 2025. According to a report, the government may reduce the current import limit by 5% as it aims to bolster local manufacturing.Citing three sources with the matter, a report by Moneycontrol claimed that further gradual reductions in subsequent years are on the cards. The import data for FY 2024-2025 may be taken as the base for slashing the limit by 5%.This decision comes after the government extended the free import of these items until December 31 (from September 30). The government's objective is to encourage companies that have received benefits under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to increase domestic production.Reportedly, the industry has sought further clarification and a formal notification from the government in this regard.The report said that consultations with industry representatives, including major players like IBM , Dell , Lenovo , and various industry associations, have taken place to discuss the proposed changes.The industry members told the publication that they have been preparing for such an outcome over the last one year. The government has also assured the industry that it aims to ensure a smooth transition to minimise disruption.To facilitate the process, a new online system will be implemented to streamline import procedures at the customs level, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring a hassle-free experience for importers.“This new system will operate entirely online with no manual intervention, streamlining the import process at the customs level to ensure a hassle-free experience for importers,” a government official was quoted as saying.“The government wants to ensure that companies who have promised to apply for PLI, are picking up manufacturing in the country. There is also a significant security interest for the government here, as roughly 70% of these items are currently imported from China and Hong Kong,” the official added.","The government is reportedly planning to introduce restrictions on the import of laptops, tablets, and personal computers starting in 2025.

In October, Taylor Swift achieved a major financial milestone, becoming the world’s wealthiest female musician with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, surpassing Rihanna. Swift’s staggering fortune has fueled curiosity about her purchasing power, particularly how everyday expenses for average consumers would compare to Swift’s budget. In a viral Instagram video, radio host Bobby Bones illustrates this stark contrast, breaking down how standard costs feel far more affordable to the global superstar than to the average person.In his video, Bobby Bones provides a unique perspective on what it would feel like for Swift to buy common items with her immense wealth. According to Bones, a $98 pair of Lululemon leggings, popular among shoppers, would feel like spending just 11 cents for Swift. A luxurious dinner for two at Nobu, averaging around $700, would cost her the equivalent of only 80 cents.These examples reveal how Taylor’s vast fortune makes typical purchases seem minuscule. Bones went on to calculate what larger expenses might feel like for her. For instance, a brand-new iPhone, typically priced around $1,200, would cost Taylor roughly $1.87. Similarly, purchasing a standard car, which generally costs around $40,000, would feel like spending $37 for her.Bones’s most surprising calculation was the cost of purchasing a $300,000 house, a significant investment for most. For Taylor Swift, such a purchase would feel like spending just $400. “Imagine all the houses we could buy for $400,” Bones joked, underscoring the difference between Swift’s purchasing power and that of the average consumer.As per reports, Swift’s impressive net worth, estimated at $1.6 billion, places her just behind music mogul Jay-Z, whose fortune stands at approximately $2.5 billion. Much of Swift’s wealth comes from her music and concert earnings, with Forbes reporting that $600 million of her income comes from touring alone. Her extensive music catalog, which she has strategically re-recorded and re-released to maintain ownership, contributes another $600 million to her net worth. Swift’s real estate holdings, valued at around $125 million, further boost her total wealth.Swift reached billionaire status in October 2023, largely due to the record-breaking success of her Eras Tour, which spanned the U.S., U.K., and Australia. The tour, which is set to continue through December, drew millions of fans and played a significant role in elevating her to new financial heights. In addition to concert revenue, streaming platforms have also contributed substantially to her earnings. Her 2022 album Midnights and the 2023 re-recorded 1989 (Taylor’s Version) both boosted her streaming royalties, especially on platforms like Spotify.Despite her considerable wealth, Taylor Swift has maintained a close connection with her fanbase, a factor that has endeared her to millions worldwide. She continues to engage with fans and remains active on social media, ensuring that her success does not create a barrier between herself and her supporters. Currently, Swift’s Eras Tour is captivating audiences, with upcoming performances in Toronto starting November 14 and a final show in Vancouver on December 8.","In October, Taylor Swift became the world’s wealthiest female musician with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion.

China’s biggest online shopping day fails to return to pre-Covid days high once again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-biggest-online-shopping-day-fails-to-return-to-pre-covid-days-high-once-again/articleshow/115217728.cms,"FILE PHOTO: People stand near banners for the Singles’ Day shopping festival at JD.com's headquarters, during an organised tour, in Beijing, China, November 9, 2021. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo

China's once-glittering Singles' Day shopping festival has lost its lustre this year, as both consumers and merchants scale back amid the country's economic challenges and growing scepticism about promotional tactics.The world's largest e-commerce shopping event, which falls on November 11, saw consumers taking a more cautious approach, with many limiting purchases to daily necessities rather than big-ticket items. This year's event has been marked by cautious spending and scaled-back participation, reflecting broader economic challenges facing China.""I have only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,"" Wang Haihua, a Beijing fitness centre owner, told AP. ""They're all tricks and we've seen through it over the years.""Major e-commerce platforms, including Alibaba and JD.com, have notably stopped publishing their total transaction values since 2022, departing from their previous practice of showcasing double-digit growth. According to data provider Syntun, last year's gross merchandising volume across major platforms grew by just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a stark contrast to the robust growth seen before the COVID-19 pandemic.Shaun Rein, founder of China Market Research Group in Shanghai, explained to AP that consumers are increasingly resistant to the festival's appeal. ""Since October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before,"" he said.The festival's diminishing returns have also affected merchants. AP reports that some vendors are abandoning the event altogether due to high advertising costs and declining sales. Zhao Gao, a garment factory owner in Zhejiang province, said that after paying for platform advertising, he would only break even after sales.In response to the domestic slowdown, Chinese e-commerce giants are pivoting towards international markets. Alibaba reported that approximately 70,000 merchants experienced doubled sales through global free shipping initiatives, with markets like Singapore and Hong Kong seeing a surge in new customers.The shopping festival's decline mirrors China's broader economic challenges, including a persistent real estate crisis and deflationary pressures. Despite Beijing's stimulus measures, consumer confidence remains weak, with many shoppers like Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old Xi'an barber, telling AP they've stopped participating entirely since the pandemic due to reduced income.The shift in consumer behaviour suggests a fundamental change in China's retail landscape, as both merchants and shoppers adjust to what appears to be a ""new normal"" of more modest growth and selective spending.","The world's largest e-commerce shopping event, which falls on November 11, saw consumers taking a more cautious approach.

During election campaigns, US President elect Donald Trump had promised Musk the position of head of a new called ' Department of Government Efficiency ', while maintaining control of his corporate empire including Tesla , X, SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink.After Trump’s win, there have been speculations of the billionaire playing an important role in shaping US foreign and domestic policy.A proof of Elon Musk's influence in Donald Trump's government was seen last week. As Tesla and Starlink CEO Musk joined President Trump during his 25-minute call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.During the call, Musk reassured Zelenskyy about continued Starlink satellite support, which remains crucial for Ukraine's military communications, according to Axios.Musk aims to slash $2 trillion from the US budget and eliminate regulations he claims stifle innovation. Rather than directly managing government operations, he plans to install longtime deputies, engineering experts, and ideological partners at key agencies, sources familiar with the preparations told the Financial Times.""America's A team is usually building companies in the private sector,"" Musk posted on X. ""Once in a long time, reforming government is important enough that the A team allocates time to government. This is that time.""Key figures in Musk's inner circle being considered for government roles include Steve Davis, known for executing massive layoffs at X, and Omead Afshar, described as Musk's ""firefighter"" for handling challenging corporate transitions. The billionaire has also proposedSpaceX executives for Defense Department positions, including former Air Force general Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy and government affairs executive Tim Hughes.Musk's involvement in high-level diplomacy follows his substantial $119 million campaign contribution to Trump.

His social media platform X became instrumental in disseminating pro-Trump messages during the campaign, while venture capitalists David Sacks and Jason Calacanis, who frequently host Musk on their All-In podcast, are positioning themselves for potential administration roles.","Tesla and Starlink CEO Musk joined President Trump during his 25-minute call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Following Donald Trump ’s recent presidential election victory, sales of birth control and emergency contraception have seen a significant increase across the United States. Wisp, an online pharmacy specialising in reproductive and sexual health products, reported a substantial uptick in purchases as women take proactive measures to secure reproductive healthcare, according to USA TODAY. This surge reflects widespread concerns about potential changes to reproductive rights under the returning Trump administration, particularly given his influence in reshaping the Supreme Court during his first term. Wisp CEO Monica Cepak noted that this increase reflects a “heightened sense of urgency” as many women seek to safeguard their access to essential healthcare products amid the changing political landscape.Wisp, which serves over 1.2 million patients nationwide, observed a staggering 1,000% increase in emergency contraception sales from November 5 to November 6. The pharmacy reported a further 1,650% spike in new patients purchasing these products within 24 hours following Election Day. The company also experienced a 600% increase in medication abortion sales and a 50% increase in birth control purchases, marking a notable rise in overall demand for reproductive health items.Monica Cepak, Wisp’s CEO, explained that women are taking assertive steps to secure these resources in light of “uncertainty surrounding reproductive rights.” She noted, “Women are using this moment to take back agency over their reproductive rights by stockpiling emergency contraception and preventive healthcare measures.”This surge in demand for reproductive health products is deeply rooted in Trump’s previous influence over the Supreme Court. During his first term, Trump appointed three conservative justices who played pivotal roles in overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that had guaranteed nationwide abortion rights for decades. The Supreme Court’s decision allowed numerous states to implement restrictive abortion laws, effectively banning the procedure in some areas. Trump has openly embraced his role in reshaping the legal landscape around reproductive rights, stating, “I did it, and I'm proud to have done it.”As Trump returns to the White House, concerns are growing over further potential restrictions, including a nationwide abortion ban. Although Trump has distanced himself from discussing a national ban during his recent campaign, his prior actions have left an indelible mark on reproductive rights, prompting widespread anxiety about what may come next.The surge in purchases came from women in states with restrictive abortion laws, including Texas, Indiana, and Oklahoma, where access to reproductive healthcare is highly limited. However, Wisp also reported increases in states like California and New York, which continue to protect reproductive rights.Wisp noted, “Despite being states where reproductive rights are fully protected, we're seeing women take precautionary measures as the future remains uncertain.” The demand for reproductive healthcare products is not confined to states with strict regulations, indicating that women nationwide are concerned about securing their reproductive health amidst political shifts.According to USA TODAY, Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder of Whole Woman’s Health, which operates clinics across several states, confirmed an uptick in demand for long-term contraception and abortion medication. Her organisation has noted increased requests for emergency contraception, long-acting reversible contraception, and pre-emptive provisions of medication abortion, particularly through telemedicine services.“We’re seeing an increased demand for emergency contraception, long-acting contraception, and telemedicine provision of these services, especially in states with abortion bans,” Hagstrom Miller said, adding that this trend reflects a broader effort by women to secure access to reproductive healthcare options in anticipation of potential future restrictions.Trump’s election campaign strategically downplayed the issue of abortion, focusing instead on other key political themes. In the months leading up to the election, Trump suggested a 16-week abortion ban but ultimately refrained from committing to any concrete measures. Reproductive rights advocacy groups, however, continue to emphasise the importance of this issue, pointing to widespread voter support for reproductive freedom. Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of URGE: Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity, stated, “Trump ran from his record and lied about his position on abortion. Even Trump knows how unpopular abortion bans are.”On Election Day, voters in seven out of ten states with abortion on the ballot expressed support for reproductive rights. Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, remarked, “Abortion was on the ballot, and abortion won, but the election outcome reminds us that the path toward reproductive freedom is a long one. It won’t be won or lost in a single election.”Wisp anticipates continued demand for reproductive healthcare products in the coming months. CEO Monica Cepak emphasised the importance of providing accessible, preventive healthcare options for those seeking security over their reproductive choices. She remarked, “We expect that momentum to sustain over the next few weeks and months as women continue to prepare for the uncertain landscape.”The recent surge reflects a growing trend among women to proactively protect their reproductive health amidst political uncertainty. As discussions about reproductive rights continue to evolve, healthcare providers and advocacy organisations alike are adapting to meet the increasing demand for reproductive healthcare solutions.","Sales of birth control and emergency contraception have seen a significant increase across the United States.

We wanted 'tomato dot com,' but we didn't get that domain,” said Goyal.In a failed attempt to get the desired domain name Goyal revealed that he changed one letter in the name and that is how tomato became Zomato and the company got the domain name — Zomato.com.Apart from this, Goyal also shared his love story with his wife Grecia Munoz on the show. Kapil asked the couple about their love story and how Goyal met Munoz.“I was single for a long time. My friends would often set me up on dates but always warned me not to take things too seriously. When Grecia arrived in Delhi, a friend called me and said, 'There's a girl here you must meet,' adding, 'You'll end up marrying her.'

Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia .... breaks silence on Elon Musk-owned Starlink's entry in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/telecom-minister-jyotiraditya-scindia-breaks-silence-on-elon-musk-owned-starlinks-entry-in-india/articleshow/115211067.cms,"Elon Musk's Starlink must meet India's regulatory and security requirements before receiving a license to operate satellite internet services, according to Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia. While Starlink is working towards compliance, the government awaits recommendations from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on spectrum pricing and allocation for satellite broadband services.

Government’s scrutiny of Starlink's operations

Spectrum allocation debate intensifies



Union Minister for Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia stated Tuesday that Elon Musk's Starlink must address all security concerns and comply with regulatory requirements before receiving a licence to operate satellite internet services in India.""We are ready to give a licence to anyone, including Starlink. They have to comply with all our concerns,"" Scindia told media. ""We have to see that all security concerns are addressed. There is a specific format. You have to check all the boxes. When you check all the boxes, you get the licence.""The minister's comments come amid an ongoing debate over satellite spectrum allocation in India . Currently, only Bharti Group-backed OneWeb and Jio Satellite Communications, a joint venture with SES, have received operating licences in the country.Scindia mentioned that there’s a specific format for obtaining a licence in India, and if Starlink adheres to that format, they’ll be granted the licence. He informed the media that Starlink is currently working on addressing the security requirements for the licence.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has already sought clarifications from Starlink on several critical aspects, as reported by The Economic Times. The regulatory body has asked clarification on the data storage protocols and shareholding patterns, particularly regarding investments or contracts from US security agencies. The company must also provide detailed information about its geographical coverage in India, including specific latitude and longitude coordinates for terminals planned near border areas.Security protocols require that these terminals must cease communication if there are changes in their geographical position to prevent potential misuse. These requirements are part of a comprehensive set of compliance measures covering data handling, coverage areas, and security protocols that satellite communication providers must fulfil to operate in India.On the crucial matter of satellite spectrum pricing, Scindia indicated that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) would provide clarity on the issue.The issue has sparked a controversy between traditional telecom operators and satellite internet providers. While companies like Reliance Jio and Airtel advocate for spectrum auctions to ensure fair competition, satellite operators prefer the administrative allocation route.Scindia had earlier clarified that spectrum for satellite broadband would be allocated rather than auctioned, noting that this aligns with International Telecommunications Union (ITU) guidelines and global practices. ""I cannot think of a single country that auctions spectrum for satellite,"" he stated in a recent interview with PTI.Elon Musk responded positively to this development, describing it as ""promising"" in a post on X (formerly Twitter).Satellite broadband services have yet to commence in India as the government awaits recommendations from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on spectrum pricing and allocation methods. Once Starlink completes all regulatory requirements and addresses security concerns, they will be eligible for a licence, opening up another player in India's emerging satellite internet market.",Union Minister for Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia stated Tuesday that Elon Musk's Starlink must address all security concerns and comply with regulatory requirements.

What is refactoring

Freshers aiming for jobs at top IT firms are now required to ‘refactor’ an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated code as part of the hiring process. According to a Economic Times report, “from being asked to write simple codes, candidates are being asked to optimise and restructure existing AI written codes, to improve quality”.Experts argue that coding from scratch doesn’t align with the realities of modern software development , particularly within large organisations that rely heavily on vast code libraries and AI-driven tools. Another expert said that the 2025 onwards test will include questions on knowledge of AI coding tools as they will become coding assistants for freshers in future.Refactoring code means restructuring or reorganising an existing code without changing its external behaviour. The purpose is to improve the code's readability, maintainability, and efficiency, making it easier to understand.The report quotes Chirag Mehta, vice president and principal analyst, Constellation Research, who said, “The focus in hiring has shifted from just programming skills to broader problem-solving capabilities….. Hiring tests for entry-level engineers are evolving to gauge candidates' ability to learn new methods, optimise existing code, and “refactor” it to improve quality. It’s about finding engineers who are agile thinkers, not just scriptwriters.”Yugal Joshi, partner, Everest group, said, “Unlike earlier times where developers were focused more on technical aspects of software development, now other skills such as reviewing AI-generated code, assessing AI-generated documents such as, code comments, requirements, etc is important as well.” HAddressing concerns about securing AI-generated code, Mehta explained that such code presents unique security challenges. He said “There’s a bias to trust code created by AI, but these tools are as prone, if not more, to introducing vulnerabilities as human coders. If an AI tool generates insecure code, that risk multiplies as more developers rely on it across projects. Companies must “shift left” to address security upfront—reviewing AI-generated code for vulnerabilities and rigorously validating the tools themselves. Security needs to be baked into the code generation process, ensuring that AI aids development without compromising safety, leading to security by design.”","Refactoring code means restructuring or reorganising an existing code without changing its external behaviour.

When Telegram CEO said he fathered over 100 kids

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov is once again making headlines. The CEO, who once said that he has fathered over 100 children, is now linked to an unusual offer from Moscow-based fertility clinic AltraVita IVF . The clinic is offering free in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments using Durov’s sperm to women under the age of 37.“Free IVF with Pavel Durov's donated sperm,” reads the clinic's website. It claims to be offering “IVF for free, using Pavel Durov’s sperm-one of the most famous and successful entrepreneurs of our time.” The offer is limited to women under 37, with a restricted number of treatment slots available.“We are happy to offer you a unique opportunity! Only in our clinic you can undergo IVF for free, using Pavel Durov’s sperm-one of the most famous and successful entrepreneurs of our time. This opportunity is one of a kind and the number of slots is limited,” reads the clinic’s website The Russia-based AltraVita clinic claims to be the exclusive facility authorized to store and utilize Durov's sperm.“The only Pavel Durov’s sperm bank in the world - Only our cryobank has the exclusive right to store and use biomaterial of Pavel Durov,” the clinic’s website reads.It further states that “Pavel Durov is willing to finance all the IVF protocols that use his sperm.”“It is a very generous contribution to society from someone who wants to help those dreaming of becoming parents,” it adds.This isn't Durov's first involvement in genetic legacy projects. The tech executive has previously claimed to have more than 100 biological children in 12 different countries through donor programs. He has expressed interest in making his genetic information more widely available to help his biological children connect with their heritage.“I am proud that I did my duty. The shortage of healthy sperm has become an increasingly serious issue worldwide, and I'm proud that I did my part to help alleviate it. I also want to help destigmatize the whole notion of sperm donation and incentivize more healthy men to do it, so that families struggling to have kids can enjoy more options. Defy convention - redefine the norm,” Durov then said.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov linked to offer from Moscow-based fertility clinic AltraVita IVF.

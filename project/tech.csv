Ola Electric faces investigation

Bhavish Aggarwal-led Ola Electric has received yet another show-cause notice from the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). In a December 5, 2024, exchange filing, the company disclosed that the CCPA has requested additional documents and information following its earlier response to the authority. Ola Electric said that it has received an email dated December 4, 2024 from the CCPA.The company received a show cause notice from CCPA on October 7, 2024 for “alleged violation of consumer rights, misleading advertisement and unfair trade practices”.

The Company will ensure a timely response within the specified timeframe.”In November this year, the regulatory authority asked the Bureau of Indian Standards to conduct a detailed investigation over its consumer complaint redressal practices.

Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, the tech billionaire revealed his continued passion and commitment to the company he founded 30 years ago.""My heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there and my love is there,"" Bezos said, emphasizing his ongoing involvement. The world's second-richest man is particularly focused on helping Amazon become a leader in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, with the company currently developing 1,000 internal AI applications.A key strategic move involves building a powerful supercomputer in collaboration with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. This initiative aims to provide Amazon with significant computing capabilities to compete against other tech giants, like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, in the AI race. The company is reportedly developing a multimodal AI model capable of processing images, video, and text.While Bezos stepped down as CEO in 2021 to concentrate on Blue Origin, his rocket company, he remains Amazon's executive chairman. He continues to support current CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team, mirroring a trend seen with other tech founders like Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who returned to assist with AI initiatives.Bezos is optimistic about the company's future, drawing parallels to other tech leaders reinvesting in their original companies during the AI revolution. His deep engagement suggests Amazon is positioning itself as a serious contender in the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence market.""I'll always be there to help, and right now, I'm putting a lot of time into it,"" Bezos said.

Zerodha CEO answers biggest insurance question: Why claims are rejected and what to and not to do,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zerodha-ceo-answers-biggest-insurance-question-why-claims-are-reject-and-what-to-and-not-to-do/articleshow/116014596.cms,"Kamath highlights why claims are rejected

Waiting period denial: Insurers often set waiting periods for specific illness and PEDs. Review these with your advisor when buying a policy

Non-coverage: Some treatments are permanently excluded from coverage (eg. drug abuse, etc) Review the policy/consult your advisor to understand these limitations fully.

Fraudulent claims: Claims may be rejected for non-disclosure of critical medical information. As a rule of thumb, always disclose your PEDs during your application.

Blacklisted hospitals: Insurers may deny claims if treatment is received at hospitals excluded from their coverage. Check your insurer’s list of excluded hospitals before admission.

Unnecessary hospitalisation: Claims may be denied if hospitalisation is deemed unnecessary (eg. fever).

Insurer Delays: The insurer may delay cashless approval for further investigation.

Possible PED: Claims may be questioned if a PED is suspected.

Navigating the complexities of insurance can be daunting, especially when faced with a claim rejection. Nithin Kamath , CEO of Zerodha, an online brokerage firm, recently addressed a common concern: why insurance claims get denied. Kamath highlighted a crucial point: many people lack comprehensive understanding of their insurance policies' coverage and exclusions. This often leads to confusion and disappointment when claims are rejected.In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) Kamath emphasized the importance of thoroughly reading and understanding your insurance policy . This includes identifying exclusions and pre-existing conditions that might limit coverage. “Having insurance alone isn't enough. Just because you have insurance doesn't mean all your claims will be processed. Insurance companies often don't pay claims in full or flat-out reject the claims. It's important to know the common reasons why claims get rejected and what you can do about it,” Kamath said in a post.Kamath also acknowledged that facing claim rejection can be stressful. He encouraged individuals to seek guidance from insurance advisors or legal professionals if needed throughout the process.","Nithin Kamath, CEO of Zerodha, recently addressed a common concern: why insurance claims get denied.

Nvidia may be ready to take on Intel in one of its biggest ‘fortresses’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-may-be-ready-to-take-on-intel-in-one-of-its-biggest-fortresses/articleshow/116025846.cms,"

How this chip plant may not completely cut Nvidia’s Taiwan ‘ties’

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is reportedly talking with Nvidia about manufacturing its Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its new Arizona plant. If these rumoured talks go through, TSMC may potentially secure another major customer for the facility. Last month, Intel was awarded nearly $8 billion in funding from the US Department of Commerce to boost its semiconductor manufacturing and packaging capabilities in multiple sites including Arizona. This funding, which was provided through the CHIPS and Science Act aims to strengthen domestic chip production and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers. With TSMC reportedly in talks with Nvidia to produce its AI chips at this plant, it can affect Intel’s AI chip goals. When made in the US, Nvidia may offer its AI chips to its customers at a more competitive price.As per the latest annual tally by the Arizona Republic confirmed that Intel is one of largest non-governmental employers in this US state. With nearly 12,000 employees in Chandler, this makes the chipmaker a significant contributor to the state's economy and workforce.A report by the news agency Reuters cited three sources familiar with the matter (who remained anonymous) to claim the Nvidia-TSMC Arizona plant is scheduled to begin volume production next year and is already preparing to manufacture the chips early next year. Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, unveiled in March this year, have been in high demand for generative AI and accelerated computing tasks. These chips are said to be 30 times faster at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. Currently manufactured in Taiwan, producing them in Arizona would also align with US efforts to boost domestic chip production.Two sources also reportedly claimed that Apple and Advanced Micro Devices are a part of Nvidia’s list of customers that will be supplied from the Arizona plant.While TSMC may have plans to manufacture the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be sent back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility reportedly lacks the necessary **chip on wafer on substrate** (CoWoS) capacity required for the Blackwell chips, two sources added. Currently, all of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is based in Taiwan.TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker based in Taiwan, is also investing tens of billions of dollars into the construction of three facilities in Phoenix. The project has received substantial subsidies from the US government, which aims to boost semiconductor manufacturing within the country.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is reportedly talking with Nvidia about manufacturing its Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its new Arizona plant.

Government sends notice to WhatsApp after 'scam alarm' from telecom regulator TRAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-sends-notice-to-whatsapp-after-scam-alarm-from-telecom-regulator-trai/articleshow/116020712.cms,"The big jurisdiction problem with WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram

The 'big OTT scam problem' Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea face

How fraudsters scam users on OTT apps

The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) has reportedly urged Meta Platforms, the parent company of WhatsApp, to address scams originating on the messaging platform. This follows a request from India’s telecom regulator for intervention. According to an Economic Times report quoting MeitY secretary S. Krishnan, the ministry is actively addressing the issue with Meta. “This is an ongoing process. Scammers will always find new ways, which is a cause for concern,” Krishnan told ET.Krishnan further said that the government is in a regular dialogue with stakeholders particularly WhatsApp and added that users need to be cautious and raise complaints even in the case of WhatsApp. “If there is some wrong content, there is a process. The IT rules require these companies to have a grievance officer with whom users can raise issues. They can raise it either within the app or outside. In case, the issue is not dealt with, there is also a grievance appellate committee.”Recently, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) asked MeitY to probe and prevent calls and messages sent out by scamsters using WhatsApp. “WhatsApp calls at present, are being looked at by MeitY, so on that we have already written to the ministry saying that Trai is already working in respect to voice calls and SMS, and requested them to take appropriate action,” Trai chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti told ET in a recent interaction.The OTT apps like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram currently fall under MeitY’s mandate in terms of regulatory compliance- not under The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and the telecom department. The telecom regulator is pushing the Ministry of Electronics and IT (Meity) to take strong steps to check rampant instances of spam and phishing communications that are rapidly shifting to over-the-top (OTT) apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram.An official said while WhatsApp is cooperating with the DoT to some extent and has blocked numbers as requested by the government, there is no visible control yet over Telegram and Signal-platforms that need to take concrete steps to curb scams. However, what makes WhatsApp's case is its huge user base in India.The telecom operators -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea -- have been highlighting the issue of rising instances of spam on OTT platforms and all the measures to control the menace do not work on OTTs as they are not regulated, either by DoT or Trai.Every time the regulator asks the telcos to block numbers for spam, their corresponding OTT numbers too have to be blocked. But since telcos can't do it, the numbers are provided to platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram by the DoT for blocking, who have to do that at their end. But unlike telcos, the OTT platforms are not bound by any licence to block the numbers. Further, there are international numbers, from which spam continues to come and telcos have no control over it.The fraudsters have been abusing WhatsApp to commit financial frauds. Modus operandi includes asking for screen share and taking remote access of a smartphone to steal personal data, and in other cases asking for a one-time password (OTP) to swindle money from a bank account.","The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) has reportedly urged Meta Platforms, the parent company of WhatsApp, to address scams originating on the messaging platform.

When Bryan Johnson accepted 'defeat' with his anti-ageing therapy

Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson , famed for his age-reversing experiments, recently connected with Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal at an exclusive event titled “Don’t Die.” The gathering, inspired by Johnson’s movement advocating longer, healthier, and happier lives, was hosted by Goyal at Soho House for an intimate audience of 50 select attendees. Sharing the experience on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson wrote, “Last night at Soho House with @deepigoyal, who built @zomato into one of the most successful companies in India.”For those unaware, Soho is an international private members’ club in Mumbai. “There were over 1,100 applications for 50 seats. Sad to miss so many of you. Thank you @akshaybd and @thetanmay for hosting,” he added, sharing images from the event.The event was also attended by a Mumbai-based doctor Rickson Pereira who wrote on X: “Had an enlightening Sunday evening listening to @bryan_johnson talk about his project ‘Blueprint’. “Blueprint” is his personal project where he aims to “not die” by implementing a rigorous daily routine that includes diet, exercise, sleep, and supplements. He works closely with a team of doctors and researchers to monitor his body’s biomarkers and adjust his routine for optimal health. I subscribe to his ideology of prioritising your health first. I have been following his work for over a year and I think he is doing an amazing job of generating data about what works for human body and what is required to be in peak physical health. Thank you @thetanmay for the invite.”Bryan Johnson’s anti-aging journey, part of his ambitious Project Blueprint , has involved controversial methods such as receiving blood transfusions from his teenage son—a ""young blood"" procedure not approved by the FDA—alongside a strict diet with Blueprint-branded supplements and regular gene therapy injections.In November this year, Johnson accepted facing a setback when a recent procedure reportedly caused severe swelling to his face. Sharing a post on Instagram, Johnson wrote that he injected a fat-derived extracellular matrix into his face as part of first therapy under a procedure called “Project Baby Face”. He said that immediately following the injections, his face began to blow up. “And then it got worse, and worse, and worse until I couldn’t even see. It was a severe allergic reaction,” he added.","Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson is famed for his age-reversing experiments.

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost. However, taxpayers must pay a nominal fee for a physical PAN card. Existing PAN cards remain valid even without the QR code. This article provides a detailed overview of PAN 2.0 and a step-by-step guide to applying for and receiving your PAN card digitally.Before proceeding, determine whether your PAN was issued by NSDL or UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Ltd. (UTIITSL). This information is located on the back of your PAN card.The inclusion of QR codes on PAN cards enhances security by providing a quick and reliable way to verify their authenticity. The encrypted data stored in the QR code allows authorities, banks, and other institutions to easily access and confirm the cardholder's details, ensuring protection against counterfeit or fraudulent PAN cards.According to experts, individuals with older white PAN cards or those lacking QR codes should switch to the newer version featuring a QR code. They believe the updated PAN card design, known as PAN 2.0, will help mitigate fraud risks by incorporating a QR code for faster and more efficient verification.","The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115808793,imgsize-78664,width-400,resizemode-4/115808793.jpg"

A Virginia man, Naresh Bhatt , has been charged with the murder of his wife, Mamta Bhatt , four months after her disappearance. The case has drawn widespread attention due to its complex nature, involving suspicious internet searches and the absence of the victim’s body. The 37-year-old was indicted by a Prince William County grand jury on charges of murder and defiling a dead body. Despite the lack of a body, investigators linked Mamta’s DNA to blood found at the couple's home in Manassas. This case has not only shaken the local community but has also sparked international concern, particularly among Mamta's family and supporters in Nepal.Prosecutors revealed that Naresh Bhatt conducted troubling internet searches three months before Mamta’s disappearance. Queries such as ""How long does it take to get married after a spouse dies?"" and ""What happens to debt of a deceased spouse?"" raised significant suspicion. These searches came to light during the investigation and have become a key component of the prosecution’s case.Mamta Bhatt, a 28-year-old pediatric nurse, was last seen in late July 2024. Her sudden disappearance led to an intensive search effort by local authorities and the community. While her body has not been recovered, investigators discovered blood at the couple's home, later confirmed to match Mamta's DNA.As per reports, three weeks after Mamta went missing, Naresh was charged with concealing a dead body. He was detained and has remained in jail since the arrest. This charge eventually escalated to murder and defiling a corpse following further investigation.Mamta’s disappearance galvanised the local community in northern Virginia and her family in Nepal. Social media campaigns, rallies, and community events were organized to keep the case in the public eye. The collective efforts aimed to pressure authorities for a resolution and to honor Mamta’s memory.Prince William County Police Chief Mario Lugo expressed confidence in the case despite the absence of Mamta’s body. “From the beginning, we believed that she was murdered,” Lugo stated during a press briefing. He also emphasized the strength of the evidence, which includes the DNA match and Naresh’s suspicious online activities.The case has highlighted the complexities of prosecuting a murder charge without a body. However, legal experts point out that advances in forensic science and circumstantial evidence can build a compelling case.The case has drawn significant public interest due to its disturbing details and the broader implications for domestic violence awareness . Many have called for justice for Mamta, while others have questioned the legal challenges of convicting a suspect without a recovered body.Authorities are continuing their investigation to locate Mamta’s remains and gather additional evidence. Naresh Bhatt is set to face trial, and prosecutors are determined to seek justice for Mamta.","Mamta Bhatt, a 28-year-old pediatric nurse, was last seen in late July 2024.

In a recent social media post, Elon Musk , known for his futuristic visions and outspoken opinions, drew attention to Singapore’s alarming decline in fertility rates. His comments were in response to a post by Mario Nawfal, a well-known X (formerly Twitter) personality, discussing the nation’s “baby crisis” and the role of robotics in mitigating its effects. Musk’s statement, “Singapore (and many other countries) are going extinct,” has reignited global conversations about demographic challenges faced by developed societies.Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades. In 2023, the TFR reached a historic low of 0.97, marking the first time it has dipped below 1.0. This figure signifies that, on average, each woman in Singapore is having fewer than one child—far below the replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population.The primary drivers of Singapore’s fertility decline stem from evolving societal trends. Data from the Singapore government reveals that a growing number of women aged 25–34, considered prime childbearing years, are choosing to remain single. Additionally, the marital fertility rate among women in their 20s has seen a substantial decline, accounting for approximately 32% of the overall drop in TFR.Between 1990 and 2005, marital fertility rates among women aged 25–34 experienced a sharp decrease. While there was a slight recovery in 2023, the long-term trend remains concerning.Despite its demographic challenges, Singapore’s advancements in robotics and automation could help address labor shortages caused by a declining workforce. According to the International Federation of Robotics, Singapore ranks second globally in robot density, with 770 industrial robots per 10,000 workers. This technological prowess allows the country to sustain industries despite high labor costs and a relatively small manufacturing base.Musk’s interest in robotics is well-documented through Tesla’s investment in humanoid robots designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. While he has not directly suggested robots as a replacement for human populations, his remarks hint at the potential for technology to mitigate the economic and social impacts of declining birth rates.Musk’s statement sparked widespread debate on social media, with opinions ranging from support to criticism.Some users highlighted Singapore’s strong immigration policies as a mechanism to counteract its population decline. The city-state has long relied on foreign talent and workers to supplement its labor force and sustain economic growth.Others pointed to deeper issues contributing to the reluctance to have children. Rising living costs, financial instability, and paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyles were frequently cited as barriers to family planning. Many individuals expressed concerns about the affordability of raising children in an increasingly competitive and expensive environment.Singapore’s struggle with low fertility rates mirrors challenges faced by many developed nations, including Japan, South Korea, and certain European countries. Declining birth rates have far-reaching consequences, including:","Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades.

The driver’s attempt to mislead

In an age where technology facilitates convenience, instances of scams in ride-hailing services have emerged as a concern for commuters. A Bengaluru resident recently faced such a situation but demonstrated exceptional composure and quick thinking to outwit a potential scam. Sharing her story on Reddit, she recounted her encounter with a low-rated ride-hailing driver. Despite being in a tense situation, her ability to stay calm and strategise helped her resolve the matter without escalating it. The story not only highlights the risks associated with ride-hailing services but also offers a lesson in handling such scenarios effectively.The incident occurred when the Bengaluru resident booked a Rapido cab from Central College to Hoodi, with the app quoting a fare of Rs 385. She noticed the driver had a low rating of 2.6, which raised initial concerns. However, due to heavy rain and the cab’s proximity, she decided to proceed with the booking.The journey was uneventful until the drop-off point when the driver demanded Rs 600, showing a screenshot as proof. The commuter immediately identified the screenshot as being from a previous ride and checked her app, which still showed the trip ongoing with no deviations.The situation took a turn when the driver logged out of his account and logged into another, presenting an empty ride history as evidence. He continued to insist on the inflated fare, citing server issues. Recognizing the scam, the commuter decided against direct confrontation. Instead, she pretended to sympathize with the driver’s explanation to de-escalate the situation.“I played along, telling him I’d pay whatever fare my app eventually displayed, even if it was Rs 1,000,” she wrote in her Reddit post. She logged in and out of the app, connected to her home WiFi, and pretended to call Rapido’s SOS service.After a 20-minute standoff, she suggested paying Rs 385 upfront and sending the remaining amount via Google Pay once her app updated. This strategic approach, which she referred to as a “reverse-UNO of sympathy,” worked. The driver reluctantly accepted the original fare and left. Shortly after, the app confirmed the accurate fare of Rs 385.The commuter’s story garnered widespread attention on Reddit, with users commending her calm demeanor and resourcefulness.One user remarked, “It’s unfortunate that scams like this happen, but you did a smart job staying calm and not allowing the driver to pressure you into paying more.”Another added, “Your approach of de-escalating the situation was admirable. Filing a complaint against the driver could help others avoid similar incidents.”Others highlighted the risks associated with low-rated drivers, emphasizing the importance of staying vigilant during such rides.","A commuter in Bengaluru faced a scam from a low-rated ride-hailing driver.

Take a look at the post here



Who was Saint Nicholas of Myra

What the scientist said about the real face of Santa Claus



“The skull has a very robust appearance, generating a strong face, as its dimensions on the horizontal axis are larger than average. This characteristic, combined with a thick beard, is very reminiscent of the figure we have in mind when we think of Santa Claus,”

“We initially reconstructed the skull in 3D using this data. We supplemented this with the anatomical deformation technique, in which the tomography of a living person’s head is adjusted so that the virtual donor’s skull matches that of the saint. The final face is an interpolation of all this information, seeking anatomical and statistical coherence,”

Scientists have used facial reconstruction technology to reveal the likely face of Saint Nicholas, the 4th-century bishop who inspired the Santa Claus legend. By analysing data from Saint Nicholas 's skull, researchers created a detailed image showing a white-bearded man with a broad forehead, thin lips, and a round nose. According to lead researcher Cicero Moraes , the reconstruction combines ""statistical projections"" and ""artistic"" interpretation. Moraes also shared the “real face” of Santa Claus in an Instagram post.Saint Nicholas of Myra, renowned for gifting only well-behaved children, originally inspired the Dutch figure Sinterklaas , who eventually evolved into the jolly, sleigh-riding figure known in the US for bringing toys to children.In an interview with Pen News (seen by The New York Post), Moraes noted that although the bishop passed away in 343 AD, long before photography existed, the 3D images depict his face as both ""strong"" and ""gentle.""he said.Moraes also highlighted that he was surprised to discover how the scientifically reconstructed images closely aligned with early literary descriptions of Santa Claus, such as the 1823 poem *“Twas The Night Before Christmas,”* which highlights his “rosy cheeks,” “broad face,” and a “nose like a cherry.”Examination of the saint’s remains even revealed signs of chronic arthritis in his spine and pelvis, as well as a thick skull that likely caused frequent headaches, Moraes added.The scientists also suggested that Saint Nicholas likely followed a mostly plant-based diet. Originally buried in Myra (modern-day Turkey), his bones were later transferred to Bari, Italy, where they remain today.Moraes explained.","Scientists have used facial reconstruction technology to reveal the likely face of Saint Nicholas, the 4th-century bishop who inspired the Santa Claus legend.

"Key leaders behind Google’s NotebookLM, which CEO Sundar Pichai called “an incredibly popular product”, are leaving",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/key-leaders-behind-googles-notebooklm-which-ceo-sundar-pichai-called-an-incredibly-popular-product-are-leaving/articleshow/116014031.cms,"Read Raiza Martin’s LinkedIn post:

Today is my last day at Google after 5.5 years, where most recently I was leading the NotebookLM team. I’ve learned a lot in the last couple of years as we went from idea to prototype to a product loved by millions of users — and I could not imagine a better team and product to end this chapter of my career.

While I'm incredibly proud of what we built, the most valuable thing I found isn't just the product – it's the friendships and partnerships formed in the trenches.

Specifically, Jason Spielman and Stephen Hughes:

Jason is one of my best collaborators, having worked with him for over four years now across multiple teams. We met during the pandemic, and I couldn't believe how well we were able to translate ideas into reality, even with this totally new working style. As partners, we spend most of our time in Figma, sharing a screen, cranking hard on product design for hours. Jason is one of the most talented and creative professionals I have met who is equally able to execute at an inhuman pace.

Stephen is exactly the sort of person I hoped I'd meet at Google: brilliant, thoughtful, creative — and a true 10x engineer. It turns out those aren't mythical after all. At any given time, Stephen probably writes more code than the 3 most productive engineers I know, combined. The best part about Stephen is how incredibly product-minded and user-centric he is. It makes him a well-respected and beloved member of any team he is on-- a natural leader.

The three of us discovered we each individually have always wanted to be part of a startup and we couldn't shake the feeling that there's a massive opportunity to build something transformative in this space.

So we're doing just that.

We're in the early stages of building something new. If you're curious about what we're up to (or just want to follow along as we build), you can sign up here to get regular updates: https://werebuilding.ai/

To everyone who supported NotebookLM's journey – especially our early users who shaped the product with their feedback – thank you. Building alongside you has been the highlight of my time at Google. There is a lot in store for NotebookLM on the horizon and I have so much confidence that this team and product will continue to delight millions more people in the future.

Time to write the next chapter.

P.S. If you’re interested in building with us, hit me up at hello@raiza.ai – I’d love to hear from you.

Three key members of Google 's NotebookLM team, including the team lead and designer, have left the tech giant to pursue a new venture.

Retail investors with demat accounts are generally required to use unique contact details, such as mobile numbers and email addresses, to maintain confidentiality and ensure privacy. However, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has introduced an exception to this rule, allowing family members to share these contact details under specific circumstances. This decision, outlined in a circular dated December 3, 2024, addresses concerns raised by brokers while ensuring regulatory compliance. The change provides clarity on how exceptions are managed for individuals and non-individual clients, reflecting SEBI ’s effort to balance privacy with practical needs.SEBI’s circular permits stockbrokers to upload identical contact details for multiple clients if these clients are family members or authorized representatives of certain entities. This adjustment follows representations from the Brokers’ Industry Standards Forum (ISF), which highlighted practical challenges in enforcing unique contact details across all scenarios.The circular defines “family” as:This definition ensures that only close family members can share contact details, maintaining a controlled environment.SEBI also provided guidelines for non-individual clients, specifying who can act as an authorized person to share contact information:This development modifies SEBI Circular No. CIR/MIRSD/15/2011, dated August 2, 2011, and Clause 33 of the Master Circular for Stock Brokers, issued on August 9, 2024. These amendments came into effect immediately following the release of the December 3 circular.These measures ensure smooth implementation and adherence to the updated norms across the capital markets ecosystem.The revised rule accommodates practical needs while safeguarding investor interests.

US Immigration reforms that the bill seeks

Two Democratic Senators have introduced a new bill aimed at reuniting immigrant families and increasing the per-country caps for family-based immigration. Senators Mazie K. Hirono , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Tammy Duckworth introduced the Reuniting Families Act , designed to reduce family-based immigration backlogs, and modernize immigration laws to align with current migration patterns.Mazie K. Hirono said “As the only immigrant currently serving in the US Senate, I am proud to introduce the Reuniting Families Act to update our country's family immigration system and promote family unity”.Explaining further, she said “By implementing changes to reduce the backlog of family-based immigration visas, exempting close relatives from visa caps, and preventing the separation of LGBTQ+ families, this bill will better prioritize family unity in our immigration system”.The proposed legislation aims to “recapture” unused visas from previous years, adding them to the pool available for distribution by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The bill also seeks to exempt close relatives, including spouses, unmarried children under 21, and certain parents of legal permanent residents, from visa caps. The cap refers to the limit of H-1B visas allowed per federal fiscal year (FY).Additionally, it aims to raise per-country limits on family-based immigration, allowing countries like India, China, Mexico, and the Philippines to access more visas. It grants the government discretion in applying certain “bars” on individuals, removing unfair requirements that force individuals who entered the U.S. unlawfully to return to their home countries to seek legal status.The legislation includes measures to protect children from ""aging out"" when they turn 21, extending protections to stepchildren and children of visa holders. It also expands the criteria for canceling deportation orders, making it easier for noncitizens to stay in the US if deportation would cause extreme hardship to a US citizen or legal permanent resident family member.Furthermore, the bill addresses discrimination against LGBTQ+ families by ensuring equal treatment for those in same-sex relationships. It allows refugee spouses and partners to be resettled together and enables spouses of individuals granted asylum to join them in the US.","US Senators Mazie K.

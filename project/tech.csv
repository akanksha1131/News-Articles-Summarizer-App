What the shareholders have to say

There seems more trouble for Meta's former COO Sheryl Sandberg . Just days after, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg put the blame for all so-called wrong policies in the company on her, now comes a damning legal case. According to a report in Tech Crunch, Sandberg has been sanctioned by a Delaware judge for allegedly deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.This stems from a shareholder lawsuit filed late last year against Sandberg and former Meta board member Jeff Zients.The shareholders allege that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to discuss matters related to a 2018 lawsuit accusing Facebook leaders of violating the law and their fiduciary duties regarding user privacy. They further claim that Sandberg and Zients deleted emails from these personal accounts despite a court order not to. The judge found these allegations credible.The judge's decision states that Sandberg used a personal Gmail account under a pseudonym for communications relevant to the case. The judge also noted inconsistencies in Sandberg's responses to interrogatories and plaintiffs' questions, suggesting she selectively deleted emails rather than using an auto-delete function.As a sanction, the judge has raised the burden of proof for Sandberg's affirmative defense. She must now prove her defense with ""clear and convincing"" evidence, a higher standard than the usual ""preponderance"" of evidence. The judge also awarded certain expenses to the plaintiffs.A spokesperson for Sandberg maintains that the plaintiffs' claims are without merit, stating that ""all work emails were preserved on Facebook’s servers.""The underlying issue involves allegations that Meta violated a 2012 FTC order prohibiting the company from collecting and sharing user data without consent. Facebook allegedly sold data to commercial partners, including Cambridge Analytica, and removed required disclosures from privacy settings. Meta previously paid a $5 billion fine to the FTC in 2019 for violating this order and has also faced penalties from European regulators.",Sheryl Sandberg has been sanctioned by a Delaware judge for allegedly deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The Gadgets Now Awards 2024 witnessed a gathering of leading technological minds who assembled to perform a comprehensive review of the year's most impressive digital innovations. This distinguished panel, composed of influential figures in the technology industry, conducted a thorough examination of the current state of technological advancement.A key member of this esteemed jury was CP Gurnani , the co-founder and executive vice chairman of AIonOS. Gurnani, a visionary leader in the field of technological innovation, offered invaluable strategic insights during the evaluation process. While participating in the jury meeting, Gurnani expressed his admiration for the remarkable innovation demonstrated by the showcased products, noting that selecting a winner from such a competitive pool proved to be a challenging endeavor.“You know, on one end, I would say.. an amazing product range. Clearly when it came to innovation in design, innovation in features, innovation led by AI, and the power of the chipsets. It was really a difficult task to choose the winner,” Gurnani told the Times of India-Gadgets Now team.Gurnani expressed a desire for even more ambitious and impactful innovation, particularly in the area of environmental sustainability.“But you know, there's always this “dil mange more” moment. And I would have been happy if it was a green innovation contest. For me, the dream would be, ‘every gadget that we ever sell or supply in Delhi, should come in with those miniaturised air purifiers. If you can convert a watch into a phone; And if you can convert a phone into a TV studio. I don't see a reason why we cannot dream big and think of features, which are more software-driven, more electronics-driven and can be miniaturised,” he added.Gurnani analysed the innovation seen in different gadget categories, highlighting both progress and areas needing further development.“Clearly every category has got its own range of innovation or maturity of innovation. For example, the foldable category – whether it was the Flip or the fold category, the level of integration of hardware software, and the sophistication of hardware is very impressive, the form factor is becoming better and more importantly, the weight of the device has become a lot better,” he said.“Similarly, in the desktops or in the laptop categories, the power of the chip, the power of a gaming console or a PC console, becoming similar and even the power of not only the laptops but also that you could do a multi-fold screen right on the same device, I think it is a great innovation,” Gurnani noted.“Number three on the devices, whether it was the robotics or whether it was small improvements of noise cancellation on the earbuds, I think there is a definitive progress. Where many of us still carry those battery chargers, I think we need to improve the battery life,” he added.Gurnani also shared his view on AI – the buzzword in today's tech industry.“AI will come into the design. AI will come into the use cases. Hopefully the medical devices industry will die as the camera industry died. At one stage, because if all your testing can be done on your smartwatch or your phone, I don't see any reason why a CT scan cannot be done through one of the devices,” he added.Other jury members included, chairman of the India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), who lent his expertise on manufacturing and market trends, offering a crucial perspective on the industry's trajectory., technology advisor at FTI Consulting, contributed decades of experience in technology journalism to the panel's deliberations., CEO of WinZO Games, enriched the discussion with his specialised knowledge of digital entertainment and gaming technologies., Business Head of Times Internet Ltd, lent his keen acumen to the jury, providing a crucial analytical perspective to the selection process., Technology Editor of TOI Online, expertly moderated the jury meeting, ensuring a comprehensive and insightful review of the nominated innovations.The winners for the Jury's Choice Awards, along with the Popular Choice Awards—for which voting is open until February 7, 2025 – will be announced on February 14.","The Gadgets Now Awards 2024 witnessed a gathering of leading technological minds who assembled to perform a comprehensive review of the year's most impressive digital innovations.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

""I think it's extremely important that OpenAI gets to other platforms quickly because Microsoft is building their own AI and I don't think Microsoft will use OpenAI in the future,"" Benioff said, punctuating his observation with laughter.The partnership's strain appears to be evident with OpenAI's recent plans to expand its cloud infrastructure beyond Microsoft, partnering with SoftBank and Oracle on a $500 billion data center project called Stargate.Benioff highlighted the personal dynamics at play, noting the apparent tension between key executives: "" Mustafa Suleyman and Sam Altman are not best friends.""He pointed to their past interactions as evidence, recalling last year's Davos conference where ""Sam and Mustafa were on panels together and not getting along."" This personal friction coincides with Microsoft's strategic moves, including hiring Suleyman to lead its AI efforts.The partnership's foundation has gradually eroded since Microsoft's initial $1 billion investment in 2019. OpenAI's need for expanded computational resources and Microsoft's own AI ambitions have created increasing distance between the two organizations.Recent Microsoft AI announcements notably omit any mention of OpenAI, suggesting a potential strategic divergence. The tech giant is reportedly developing its own large language model, MAI-1, further indicating potential independence from the OpenAI partnership.Benioff, whose Salesforce uses OpenAI's enterprise models and has invested in competitor Anthropic, seems to relish the developing situation.",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff predicts a dramatic shift in their artificial intelligence partnership.

What we think

Samsung launched its most expensive Galaxy S-series smartphone – Galaxy S25 Ultra at its first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2025 in San Jose, US. With its sleek design, powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and top-tier camera capabilities, the S25 Ultra is designed to impress the consumers. The smartphone comes with a starting price tag of Rs 1,29,999 and it packs in a lot of features and looks like a compelling buy.We got the chance to spend some time with the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and here’s our first impressions of the new Samsung smartphone.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has borrowed its design aesthetics from its predecessor. The most expensive S series smartphone from Samsung continues the trend of refined aesthetics with a squared-off titanium frame and Gorilla Glass Armor 2. The Gorilla Glass Armor 2 on the Galaxy S25 Ultra is scratch resistant and it also provides anti-reflective glass ceramic cover the the smartphone. The design is both durable and elegant, with a slimmer and lighter build compared to its predecessors. The phone now features smoother, rounded corners, making it more comfortable to hold.

We really liked the display on the flagship Samsung smartphone. It offers a crisp resolution, smooth 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and enhanced Vision Booster for vivid outdoor viewing. Samsung has further enhanced brightness levels, making it easy to view even under harsh sunlight. The colour accuracy and HDR performance ensure vibrant visuals, whether you're gaming or streaming videos.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is powered by Android’s most powerful and advanced chipset – Snapdragon 8 Elite. The smartphone comes in three variants – 12GB+256GB, 12GB+512GB and 12GB + 1TB. The smartphone performed well during our initial testing and we didn’t face any lag.

The smartphone also supports Qi wireless charging. Samsung claims that the smartphone can charge from 0to 65% in just 30 minutes. However, we are yet to test this functionality and the battery backup of the smartphone.

"Pakistan lawmakers to Elon Musk: Apologise first, then seek approval",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pakistan-lawmakers-to-elon-musk-apologise-first-then-seek-approval/articleshow/117496002.cms,"Elon Musk

Pakistani senators are calling for an apology from Elon Musk , accusing him of spreading ""anti- Pakistan propaganda"" as his Starlink satellite internet service seeks regulatory approval in the country, a lawmaker told AFP. Starlink has applied for a license to operate in Pakistan but is awaiting clearance. A senate committee on information technology and telecommunications recently met to discuss the application.Committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP that several senators condemned Musk's recent comments on his social media platform, X, which they deemed ""anti-Pakistani."" These comments relate to Musk's repeated highlighting of claims that men of Pakistani origin were involved in historical child sexual abuse cases in England, primarily targeting white girls.Khan stated that the committee discussed recommending approval of Starlink's license on the condition of an apology from Musk. She clarified, ""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition, but it was a part of the discussion, and we can only give our recommendations to the government.""Musk's criticism began earlier this month, targeting the UK government's initial reluctance to hold a national inquiry into these abuse cases. One prominent case involved the sexual exploitation of at least 1,400 girls in Rotherham over a 16-year period. Subsequent investigations and court cases resulted in the conviction of numerous men, many of South Asian descent.The issue resurfaced after an Indian lawmaker posted on X on January 8, stating, ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?"" Musk responded with ""True.""These historical abuse cases are a sensitive topic in the UK, with some arguing they are exploited to fuel Islamophobia, while others contend that open discussion is suppressed.Beyond his business ventures in electric vehicles and space exploration, Musk has recently become more politically active, particularly aligning himself with figures in US politics.",Pakistani senators are calling for an apology from Elon Musk.

Exception to the Birthright Citizenship rule

When the new Birthright Citizenship policy takes place

Are H1-B visa holders impacted by the new Birthright Citizenship policy

Donald Trump began his second term as the US President with a flurry of major executive orders and directives. One such executive order he signed was to end Birthright Citizenship for children born in the US. The order will take effect 30 days from the date of issue, i.e. February 19, 2025. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what the change in Birthright Citizenship rule means and how it impacts Indians living, studying and working in the US, including H-1B visa holders.The principle of Birthright Citizenship originates from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, adopted in 1868.It says “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”Trump’s executive order challenges this interpretation by stating that the amendment was never intended to apply universally to all individuals born in the US. Under the new order, children born in the US to parents who are present in the country on temporary visas and are not a US citizen, will no longer automatically gain US citizenship.The change in Birthright Citizenship rule impacts Indians (both mother and father) on the following visas:However, if one of the parents is a US citizen or a lawful permanent resident, the children born will still automatically get US citizenship. Children born under these circumstances might still have alternative pathways to citizenship, such as being sponsored by a parent who later obtains US citizenship or permanent residency.While the executive order does not directly affect existing green card holders, it may impact the future applicants. It may indirectly influence decisions for families seeking permanent residency.The new executive order will come into effect 30 days after its issuance on January 20, 2025. This means that it is applicable to children born on or after February 19, 2025.Yes, the new Birthright Citizenship policy is expected to significantly impact H1-B visa holders. Children born in the US to parents on H-1B visas will not automatically acquire US citizenship under the new policy.","Children born in the US to parents on H-1B visas will not automatically acquire US citizenship under the new policy.

This move signals a shift from limiting AI to premium products.JB Park, President and CEO of Samsung SouthWest Asia, reiterated the company's commitment to AI during a press event in San Jose before the launch of the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung's latest flagship smartphones.Park outlined Samsung's vision for an AI-powered ecosystem, stating that ""every consumer electronics product will have AI in it going forward."" This suggests a future where AI is not just for high-end devices but becomes a standard feature across all price ranges.Park also addressed the Indian smartphone market, highlighting the increasing popularity of premium phones in smaller cities (tier 2 and tier 3). To cater to this demand, Samsung plans to double the number of Samsung Experience Stores in these areas by the end of 2025. These stores provide a unique blend of online and offline shopping experiences, making advanced technology more accessible to consumers.""Today's consumers crave experiences,"" Park explained. ""With so much readily available online on platforms like YouTube and Instagram, our strategy is to create immersive experiences across cities. We envision stores where consumers can interact with and learn about our technology, something a purely online experience can't replicate. Building physical spaces is crucial, and we're committed to expanding them.""Park reaffirmed Samsung's dedication to the 'Make in India' initiative by announcing that the Galaxy S25 series will be manufactured at the company's Noida plant.For those unfamiliar, Samsung recently unveiled its newest Galaxy S series smartphones at its Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose.

"iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia may lift soon; I strongly believe…, says investment minister",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphone-16-ban-in-indonesia-may-lift-soon-i-strongly-believe-says-investment-minister/articleshow/117460664.cms,"Why Indonesia banned iPhone 16 series sales in the country

Indonesia banned Pixel smartphones too

Indonesia is on the verge of reaching an agreement with Apple that will essentially lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales, a report has cited a minister as saying. The ban, imposed in October, stemmed from Apple's failure to comply with the country's domestic manufacturing requirements for smartphones and tablets.Bloomberg that following months of negotiations, a resolution appears imminent.“I strongly believe it will resolve very soon,” said investment minister Rosan Roeslani, adding, “Hopefully within one or two weeks, this issue can be resolved.”Apple has been actively engaged in discussions with the Indonesian government to find a mutually agreeable solution. While the company recently proposed a $1 billion investment in a local AirTag manufacturing facility, this offer was rejected by Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita.The minister emphasised the need for Apple to fulfill the local content requirement, which necessitates the domestic production of iPhone components within Indonesia.Indonesia’s ban on iPhone 16 sales stems from Apple's failure to comply with local content regulations, which require 40% of phone components to be sourced domestically. The government is pushing for increased local manufacturing and investment from tech giants.Minister Roeslani acknowledged that discrepancies exist in how Apple calculates its compliance with local content requirements.“The way they calculate it is different I think,” Roeslani said, referring to the local content requirement.“Now they find a solution on that one, so hopefully they accept the discrepancies so we can have the iPhone 16 sold in Indonesia,” he added.Indonesia also banned the sale of Google Pixel smartphones as the country. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the Google Pixel phone sales have been blocked due to the company's failure to comply with regulations requiring a minimum of 40% locally-sourced components – the same reason why the country blocked iPhone 16 sales.As per Google, its Pixel phones are currently not officially distributed in Indonesia.","Indonesia is on the verge of reaching an agreement with Apple that will essentially lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales.

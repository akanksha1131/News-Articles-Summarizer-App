The technology sector's brutal workforce reduction continues into 2025, with industry giants Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Google , and Amazon leading a wave of layoffs that has already eliminated more than 62,000 jobs in the first half of the year. From semiconductor manufacturers to social media platforms, major tech companies are restructuring operations amid economic uncertainty and shifting business priorities, leaving tens of thousands of workers searching for new opportunities in an increasingly competitive market.The layoffs span across all sectors of technology, affecting everyone from established hardware manufacturers like Intel planning to cut up to 21,700 positions to fintech companies like Block eliminating nearly 1,000 workers, streaming platforms downsizing staff, and even space companies like Blue Origin cutting over 1,000 employees. With artificial intelligence reshaping business models and companies focusing on operational efficiency, the human cost of technological transformation has become starkly apparent as some of the world's most valuable companies simultaneously invest billions in AI while eliminating traditional roles.Intel announced the most devastating single layoff in the tech industry for 2025, planning to eliminate more than 21,000 employees, representing roughly 20% of its total workforce. The semiconductor giant's cuts come ahead of its Q1 earnings call under newly appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over from longtime chief Pat Gelsinger. Additionally, Intel plans to lay off 15% to 20% of workers in its Intel Foundry division starting in July, affecting the unit that designs, manufactures, and packages semiconductors for external clients. With Intel's total workforce at 108,900 people as of December 2024, these combined reductions represent one of the largest single-company layoffs in tech history.Japanese electronics giant Panasonic announced it would cut 10,000 jobs, affecting approximately 4% of its total workforce as part of a comprehensive restructuring plan. CEO Yuki Kusumi said the cuts are designed to better prepare the century-old company for future decades, with 5,000 job losses expected in Japan and another 5,000 overseas. The company is trimming operations in non-growth areas such as televisions and industrial products to concentrate on emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. Kusumi addressed the severity of the decision during an earnings call, stating he was ""truly sorry"" but emphasized that drastic cost structure cuts were necessary for the company to pursue growth.Microsoft implemented a multi-phase layoff strategy throughout 2025, first cutting over 6,500 jobs in May, affecting approximately 3% of its global workforce of 228,000 employees. The Seattle-headquartered company followed this with additional layoffs affecting software engineers, product managers, technical program managers, marketers, and legal counsels. The May cuts represent one of Microsoft's biggest layoffs since it eliminated 10,000 employees in 2023, and the company is reportedly contemplating further reductions that could happen through additional phases, with discussions about reducing middle managers and non-coding staff to increase the ratio of programmers to product managers.Meta announced it would cut 5% of its staff, targeting what CEO Mark Zuckerberg described as ""low performers"" as the company prepares for ""an intense year."" With more than 72,000 employees as of its latest quarterly report, the social media giant's cuts affect approximately 3,600 workers. The layoffs began in February and hit teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, and logistics operations hardest. Meta also conducted additional layoffs in April, eliminating over 100 employees in its Reality Labs division, which manages virtual reality and wearable technology development for Meta's Quest headsets.HP announced it would eliminate up to 2,000 jobs as part of its ""Future Now"" restructuring plan designed to save the company $300 million before the end of its fiscal year. The cuts represent a significant portion of the computer and printer manufacturer's workforce as the company seeks to streamline operations and reduce costs. The restructuring comes as HP faces ongoing challenges in the traditional PC and printing markets, with the company pivoting toward more profitable business segments and operational efficiency improvements.Google implemented several rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, cutting hundreds of employees across multiple divisions. The search giant eliminated 200 workers in its global business unit, which handles partnerships and sales, while also laying off hundreds of employees in its platforms and devices division covering Android, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser. Additional cuts affected the People Operations and cloud organizations teams as part of a broader reorganization effort. Google offered a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based People Operations employees while restructuring to ""drive greater collaboration and expand our ability to quickly and effectively serve customers.""Amazon conducted layoffs across multiple divisions, including approximately 100 employees from its devices and services division, which encompasses the Alexa voice assistant, Echo smart speakers, Ring video doorbells, and Zoox robotaxis businesses. The e-commerce giant also laid off dozens of workers in its communications department to help the company ""move faster, increase ownership, strengthen culture, and bring teams closer to customers."" These cuts are part of Amazon's broader cost-reduction strategy, having reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 employees since the start of 2022.Jeff Bezos's space company Blue Origin laid off about 10% of its workforce, affecting more than 1,000 employees in what represents a significant reduction in the commercial space industry. CEO David Limp said the company's priority was ""to scale manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness and efficiency for customers."" The layoffs particularly targeted roles in engineering, research and development, and management positions. Limp acknowledged that rapid growth in recent years had created ""more bureaucracy and less focus than needed,"" necessitating organizational changes to align with execution priorities.Cloud-based customer management software company Salesforce cut more than 1,000 jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce, despite reporting strong financial performance during its third-quarter earnings. The cuts come as the company actively recruits and hires workers to sell new AI products, indicating a strategic shift rather than financial distress. Affected employees are eligible to apply for open internal roles, particularly in sales positions focused on Salesforce's artificial intelligence-powered products.Human resources software company Workday cut 8.5% of its workforce, eliminating around 1,750 employees as part of a strategic focus on artificial intelligence development. CEO Carl Eschenbach said the company would concentrate hiring in AI-related areas while expanding its global presence. The layoffs came with severance packages of at least 12 weeks of pay for affected employees. Eschenbach emphasized that ""the environment we're operating in today demands a new approach, particularly given our size and scale.""Japanese automaker Nissan announced the most severe cuts in the automotive sector, planning to eliminate 20,000 jobs by 2027 while reducing its factory operations from 17 to 10 facilities. The job losses include 9,000 layoffs announced late last year and come as the automaker faces challenges from US tariffs on imported vehicles and collapsing sales in China. Nissan reported a net loss of 671 billion yen ($4.5 billion) for the 2024 financial year and declined to issue an operating profit forecast for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty.Jack Dorsey's fintech company Block laid off nearly 1,000 employees in its second major workforce reduction in just over a year. The company, which operates Square, Afterpay, CashApp, and Tidal, eliminated 931 positions representing around 8% of its workforce. The restructuring involved transitioning nearly 200 managers into non-management roles and closing almost 800 open positions. Dorsey announced the layoffs in an internal email titled ""smaller block,"" emphasizing that the changes were not driven by financial targets or AI replacements but were part of streamlining operations.General Motors' autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise laid off 50% of its workforce as it prepared to shut down operations entirely. The cuts included CEO Marc Whitten and several other top executives, with the remaining portions of the company moving under General Motors' direct control. The dramatic reduction represents one of the most significant failures in the autonomous vehicle sector, eliminating hundreds of jobs as the company ceased its independent operations.Coffee giant Starbucks eliminated 1,100 corporate employees as part of a comprehensive restructuring effort led by CEO Brian Niccol. The layoffs specifically targeted corporate staff and did not affect employees working in Starbucks stores. Niccol stated in a memo that the cuts would help Starbucks ""operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration."" The company implemented the layoffs to improve results after sales declined in the previous year.Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike cut approximately 500 jobs, representing 5% of its global workforce of just over 10,000 employees. CEO George Kurtz said the Austin, Texas-based company's job cuts would position it ""to move faster, operate more efficiently, and continue cybersecurity leadership."" The layoffs came as CrowdStrike works to recover from a major software bug that temporarily disabled millions of Windows PCs worldwide, costing the company between $36 million and $53 million in restructuring expenses.Match Group, owner of Tinder and Hinge, announced it would cut 13% of its approximately 2,500 full-time workers, eliminating around 325 positions. New CEO Spencer Rascoff implemented the cuts while addressing challenges in the dating app market, particularly with younger generations souring on dating platforms. The restructuring aims to remove one out of every five managers and focus on ""product velocity"" to drive growth, with Rascoff acknowledging that apps ""have felt like a numbers game rather than a place to build real connections.""Automattic, the parent company of Tumblr and WordPress, eliminated 16% of its nearly 1,500-person global workforce. CEO Matt Mullenweg said the company had reached an ""important crossroads"" with revenue growth occurring in a highly competitive market where ""technology is evolving at unprecedented levels."" The restructuring aimed to improve ""productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest"" while the company offered severance and job placement resources to affected employees.German luxury automaker Porsche announced plans to cut 3,900 jobs over the coming years as part of efficiency improvements. About 2,000 of the reductions will come from the expiration of fixed-term contractor positions, while the company will make the remaining 1,900 cuts by 2029 through natural attrition and limited hiring. Porsche said the changes would ""make Porsche even more efficient in the medium and long term"" while discussing additional potential changes with labor leaders.","Major tech companies are restructuring operations amid economic uncertainty and shifting business priorities. The technology sector's brutal workforce reduction continues into 2025, with industry giants Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Google, and Amazon leading a wave of layoffs.

Read: Amazon CEO's full address to employees

Today, in virtually every corner of the company, we're using Generative AI to make customers lives better and easier. What started as deep conviction that every customer experience would be reinvented using AI, and that altogether new experiences we've only dreamed of would become possible, is rapidly becoming reality. Technologies like Generative AI are rare; they come about once-in-a-lifetime, and completely change what's possible for customers and businesses. So, we are investing quite expansively, and, the progress we are making is evident.

You can see it in what we're rolling out in Alexa+, our next generation

Alexa

personal assistant that's meaningfully smarter, more capable, and is the first personal assistant that can take significant actions for customers on top of providing intelligent answers to virtually any question.

You can see it with our AI shopping assistant that's being used by tens of millions of customers around the world to discover new products and make more informed purchase decisions.

You can see it in an increasing array of shopping features like ""Lens"" (very cool to be able to take a picture of an item and have it pull up the shopping result), ""Buy for Me"" (where I can ask our shopping agent to buy an item on another merchant's website for me), or Recommended Size (where we can predict the right size for you based on prior purchases and how different apparel brands run fit-wise relative to each other).

You can see it in how we're helping our independent sellers more easily create new product detail pages or get advice on how to be even more effective as a seller in our marketplace. Nearly half a million selling partners are using these services, and the listings they're creating are measurably better.

You can see it in Advertising where we've built a suite of AI tools that make it easier for brands to plan, onboard, create and optimize campaigns. In Q1 alone, over 50K advertisers used these capabilities.

And, you can see it in what we're delivering in AWS for builders, whether it's custom silicon (Trainium2) to provide better price-performance on model-training and inference, services that make it much easier to build Foundation Models (SageMaker), or leverage leading frontier models and do GenAI inference at scale (Bedrock), our own frontier model (Nova) to give customers leading intelligence at lower latency and cost, or services to make it much easier for developers to write code (Q and QCLI).

We're also using Generative AI broadly across our internal operations. In our fulfillment network, we're using AI to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots—all of which have improved cost to serve and delivery speed. We've rebuilt our Customer Service Chatbot with GenAI, providing an even better experience than we'd had before. And, we're assembling more intelligent and compelling product detail pages from leveraging GenAI.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

While we've made a lot of progress, we're still at the relative beginning. There are a few reasons we believe this and want to go even faster.

First, we have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live. Think of agents as software systems that use AI to perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems. Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time. There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast.

Second, and what makes this agentic future so compelling for Amazon, is that these agents are going to change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers. Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point. We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones. Agents will be teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work, and that will get wiser and more helpful with more experience. If we build and leverage the right agents, it's going to rapidly accelerate our ability to make customers lives easier and better every day, and it's going to make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today.

And third, we're going to keep pushing to operate like the world's largest start-up-- customer-obsessed, inventive, fast-moving, lean, scrappy, and full of missionaries trying to build something better for customers and a business that outlasts us all. You will continue to see steam and I take actions to help us move faster, have more ownership, and invent more easily. AI will be a substantial catalyst here.

Today, we have over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but at our scale, that's a small fraction of what we will ultimately build. We're going to lean in further in the coming months. We're going to make it much easier to build agents, and then build (or partner) on several new agents across all of our business units and G&A areas.

As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.

As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team's brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams. When I first started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, I worked on leaner teams that got a lot done quickly and where I could have substantial impact. We didn't have tools resembling anything like Generative AI, but we had broad remits, high ambition, and saw the opportunity to improve (and invent) so many customer experiences. Fast forward 28 years and the most transformative technology since the Internet is here. Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.

There's so much more to come with Generative AI. I'm energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what's possible for our customers, partners, and how we work.

These range from the next-generation Alexa+ personal assistant to AI-powered shopping tools used by tens of millions of customers worldwide. The company has also rebuilt its customer service chatbot with generative AI and implemented AI across its fulfillment network for inventory management and demand forecasting.Despite the job displacement warning, Jassy framed the changes as an opportunity for employees willing to adapt.

Chinese hacking groups 'targetting' Russian businesses

What techniques Chinese hackers are said to be using against Russia

Cyber analysts have reportedly discovered a strange cyberwarfare trend. According to a report by New York Times, quoting security researchers, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, groups linked to the Chinese government have repeatedly hacked Russian companies and government agencies in an apparent search for military secrets. There has been increase in Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Chinese government-linked hackers have repeatedly targeted Russian companies and government agencies, seeking military secrets, according to the New York Times report.The cyberattacks, which intensified in May 2022, have persisted despite public declarations of a “no-limits” partnership between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.The report claims that a Chinese hacking group, Sanyo, impersonated a Russian engineering firm’s email addresses in 2023 to steal data on nuclear submarines, as uncovered by Taiwan-based cybersecurity firm TeamT5, which linked the attack to Beijing. “China likely seeks to gather intelligence on Russia’s activities, including on its military operation in Ukraine, defense developments and other geopolitical maneuvers,” TeamT5 researcher Che Chang told the Times.A classified Russian FSB document, obtained by The New York Times, reveals Moscow’s concerns about China’s pursuit of Russian defense technology and battlefield insights, labeling China an “enemy.” This contrasts with the public Sino-Russian alliance, as Russia relies on China for oil markets and war-critical technology. The document highlights China’s interest in drone warfare and software, noting that “the war in Ukraine fundamentally shifted intelligence priorities for both countries,” according to Itay Cohen of Palo Alto Networks, as quoted by the Times.The New York Times also reports that Chinese hackers targeted Rostec, Russia’s state-owned defense conglomerate, for satellite communications and radar data, using malicious Microsoft Word files to infiltrate aviation and state entities. Groups like Mustang Panda, suspected of ties to China’s Ministry of State Security, have hit Russian military and border units, the Times notes, citing Rafe Pilling of Sophos. Pilling told the Times, “The targeting we’ve observed tends to be political and military intelligence gathering.”Proprietary malware like Deed RAT, used by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, has been deployed against Russian aerospace and defense sectors, the report said, citing Positive Technologies. Despite 2009 and 2015 agreements barring mutual cyberattacks, the Times notes that experts view these as symbolic, with hacking spiking post-Ukraine invasion. “The activity — we saw it immediately in the months following Russia’s full-scale invasion,” Cohen told the Times, highlighting the tension beneath the public narrative of Sino-Russian unity.","Chinese government-linked hackers have repeatedly targeted Russian companies and government agencies, seeking military secrets, according to a New York Times report.

Florida air traffic controllers briefly lose radar: Here’s what FAA said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/florida-air-traffic-controllers-briefly-lose-radar-heres-what-faa-said/articleshow/121994009.cms,"Representative Image

“There was no loss of critical air traffic service,”

Air traffic controllers in Jacksonville, Florida, briefly lost access to radar on Friday, June 20 after a fiber optic line was cut. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the outage did not result in any flight delays or cancellations, as a backup system activated immediately. The FAA said the Jacksonville radar center remained operational, though it switched to an alert status once its primary communication line went down.an FAA spokesperson said. However, officials did not confirm the cause or exact location of the fiber cut.The Jacksonville center oversees aircraft flying through around 160,000 square miles of airspace, covering parts of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, and South Carolina.This incident stood in contrast to similar radar outages earlier this year at a facility in Philadelphia. In that case, the backup system took 90 seconds to activate, and the resulting confusion led to major flight disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. Five air traffic controllers went on trauma leave following the Philadelphia outage, and hundreds of flights were canceled.The FAA said those earlier issues highlighted the need to modernise parts of the US air traffic control system, which still depends on older copper wiring. Transportation officials are pushing Congress to approve funding for system upgrades.","Fiber optic line cut at air traffic control center in Jacksonville, Florida.

Why Cognizant paid less than a rupee for 21.31 acres of land in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-cognizant-paid-less-than-a-rupee-for-21-31-acres-of-land-in-andhra-pradeshs-visakhapatnam/articleshow/121992979.cms,"Andhra’s strategic move to build IT ecosystem in the state

Following TCS blueprint for tech hub bevelopment

Global IT services giant Cognizant Technology Solutions will establish a major IT campus in Visakhapatnam after securing 21.31 acres of land from the Andhra Pradesh government for just 99 paise. The company plans to invest Rs 1,582 crore in the project, which is expected to generate 8,000 jobs over the next eight years.The land allocation at Kapulauppada under the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) reflects the state's aggressive push to transform the coastal city into a technology hub. According to sources cited by MoneyControl, Cognizant has set March 2029 as the target date for commencing commercial operations from the facility.The development aligns with Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu's vision of positioning Visakhapatnam as Andhra Pradesh's economic capital. The nominal land price underscores the state government's commitment to attracting major technology investments to the region.Earlier this year, Andhra Pradesh's IT and Human Resources Minister Nara Lokesh met with Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S at the World Economic Forum in Davos, urging the company to expand into tier-2 cities like Visakhapatnam. Lokesh has previously described his vision for the city, stating that ""if Goa were to marry Bangalore and have a child, that could be Visakhapatnam.""This land deal follows a similar arrangement made in April 2025, when the state government allotted 21 acres to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for the same nominal amount of 99 paise. The pattern demonstrates Andhra Pradesh's systematic approach to building a technology corridor in Visakhapatnam.The Teaneck, New Jersey-based Cognizant's investment represents a significant boost to the region's employment landscape. With Visakhapatnam located approximately 600 kilometers from Hyderabad and 800 kilometers from Chennai, two of India's major software hubs alongside Bengaluru, the city is positioned to become a strategic alternative for IT operations.The campus development is expected to contribute substantially to the local economy while providing skilled employment opportunities in the region.","Cognizant Technology Solutions will establish a major IT campus in Visakhapatnam.

Air India CEO Campbell Willson's letter to flyers: “We are reaching out with …”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/air-india-ceo-campbell-willsons-letter-to-flyers-we-are-reaching-out-with-/articleshow/121992525.cms,"Read Air India CEO Campbell Wilson’s complete letter here

We are reaching out with heavy hearts following the tragic crash of Air India Flight AI171 on June 12, 2025. The loss of 241 passengers and crew members, along with 34 people on the ground, has left us all in deep sorrow. Words cannot express the pain we feel for the families and loved ones affected by this devastating event. We are fully committed to doing all we can to support the families impacted and are also working closely with authorities to understand the cause of this tragedy. Our thoughts are with everyone touched by this loss.

At Air India, your safety is our highest priority and always has been since we took over the airline in 2022. In this context we want to share some important facts about Flight AI171 to provide clarity during this difficult time:

Our Crew : The flight was led by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, a highly experienced pilot and trainer with over 10,000 hours flying widebody aircraft. First Officer Clive Kunder, had over 3,400 hours of flying experience.

Our Aircraft : The plane was well-maintained, with its last major check in June 2023 and the next scheduled for December 2025. Its right engine was overhauled in March 2025, and the left engine was inspected in April 2025. Both the aircraft and engines were regularly monitored, showing no issues before the flight.

These are the facts as we know them today. We, together with the entire aviation industry, await the official investigation report to understand more.

Arising from this tragedy, and as directed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on June 14, 2025, we have been conducting thorough safety inspections on our 33 Boeing 787 aircraft. So far, inspections have been completed on 26 and these have been cleared for service. The remaining aircraft are currently in planned maintenance and will have these additional checks done before being released into service. Following the review, the DGCA has confirmed that our Boeing 787 fleet and maintenance processes fully meet safety standards.

Regrettably, the time required to perform these enhanced safety checks, along with the application of extra caution, external factors like airspace closures in Iran and the Middle East as well as night-time restrictions at some international airports, along with normal airline technical issues, has led to a higher-than-usual number of cancellations on our long-haul network in the past few days. We know these disruptions have been frustrating, and we’re truly sorry for the inconvenience.

As a confidence-building measure, we have elected to continue enhanced pre-flight safety checks on our Boeing 787 fleet and, as an added measure, our Boeing 777 aircraft, for the time being. Given the time these additional checks will consume and the potential impact on schedules, we have decided to reduce our international widebody flights by around 15% starting June 20, 2025 through to at least mid-July. This will also allow us to have more backup aircraft ready to handle any unexpected issues.



We understand that this temporary reduction to our schedule may affect your travel plans, and we’re deeply sorry for any inconvenience. If your flight is impacted, we will contact you to offer rebooking on another flight at no extra cost, or a full refund. We will share the updated international schedule within the next few days.

This is a challenging time for all of us. We are grateful for your support, and your understanding that safety must always come first. Your trust means everything to us, so if you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us through our customer support channels.

Thank you for choosing Air India, and for being part of the Maharaja Club.

We are dedicated to serving you with care and, always, with safety.

Warm regards,

Campbell Wilson

Startups can't rely on ""vibe coding"" alone

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says the ""key for winning"" with AI coding tools is maintaining the ability to quickly modify AI-generated code manually, rather than relying entirely on automated agents. Speaking on ""The MAD Podcast with Matt Turck,"" Dohmke emphasized that developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between AI assistance and hands-on coding.The CEO outlined an ideal workflow where AI agents can write code and submit pull requests, but developers retain the ability to make rapid changes using their existing programming skills . This approach prevents the productivity trap of spending minutes describing simple changes in natural language when the same task could be completed in seconds through direct coding.""The worst alternative is trying to figure out how to provide feedback or prompt to describe in natural language what I already know how to do in programming language,"" Thomas Dohmke explained. Such scenarios could transform three-second tasks into three-minute ordeals, ultimately reducing rather than enhancing productivity.Thomas Dohmke also addressed the trending "" vibe coding "" phenomenon, a term coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy to describe heavy reliance on AI for code generation. During a recent Q&A at Station F in Paris, the GitHub CEO cautioned that startups cannot scale on vibe coding alone.Non-technical founders will struggle to build sustainable companies without skilled developers, he argued, noting they ""can't build a complex system to justify the next round."" The key is enabling developers to choose the best approach for each situation, whether that's leveraging AI agents for maximum ROI or handling tasks directly themselves.","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between AI assistance and hands-on coding.

AI adoption still in early stages



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sells $546,547 worth of company stock







Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has acknowledged that many of his enterprise customers are still struggling to understand and implement artificial intelligence, even as the company is increasing its investment in AI-powered platforms. Speaking in an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer at the opening day of Dreameforce 2025, Benioff said that the pace of innovation is already outstripping the awareness and readiness of the customer. “Customers are getting their head around how to deploy AI,” Benioff said. “The speed of innovation is far exceeding the speed of customer adoption.”Benioff’s remarks comes at time when Salesforce shared remain down by more than 30% from their December 2024 peak and 28% lower year-over-year. The company has also faced skepticism from investors despite the roll out of its Agentforce platform. For those unaware, the Agentforce platform uses autonomous AI bots to streamline operations. In August this year, Salesforce also announced that it has reduced its support staff from 9000 to 5000 employees. The company revealed that its decision to cut down jobs was driven by the efficiency gains from AI agents.“People don’t understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce,” Benioff told Cramer.“It is the core of every product we make now.”During his keynote at the San Francisco’s Moscone Center, Benioff revealed that Salesforce’s clients such as Williams-Sonoma and Pandora have successfully completed the AI integration. But he also added that most of the companies are still facing significant architectural challenges. “These customers have to go back and modify massive architectures they have and systems they’re running,” he said.In related news, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sold company shares worth nearly $546,547 on September 26, 2025, Investing.com reported. Citing regulatory filings, the report says that the sale was executed under a pre-arranged trading plan, involving 2,250 shares of common stock sold in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $241.4027 to $244.279. On the same day, Benioff exercised options to buy 2,250 shares of Salesforce at $161.50 each, for a total value of $363,375.After these transactions, Marc Benioff now owns 11,911,571 shares of Salesforce common stock. Indirectly, he owns 10,000,000 shares through the Marc Benioff Fund LLC and 1,07,000 shares by trust.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sold $546,547 worth of company stock on September 26, 2025.

US-China trade tension

Global squeeze on supply chains





In a move that highlights the geopolitical tightrope countries are walking in the US-China battle for technological supremacy, the Dutch government has seized control of a Chinese-owned chip company, Nexperia. The rare takeover, announced this week, follows significant pressure from Washington and has prompted a strong rebuke from Nexperia's parent company.The Dutch government cited “serious governance shortcomings” as the official reason for the takeover. However, court documents published Tuesday reveal a more direct catalyst: American officials had warned the Dutch government that Nexperia's CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, would likely need to be replaced for the company to be removed from the U.S. ""entity list,"" which imposes strict export restrictions. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal document cites minutes from a June meeting between Dutch and American officials, where the U.S. Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation stated. “The fact that the company’s CEO is still the same Chinese owner is problematic,” the minutes of the meeting said, as cited by the document. “It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list.”The intervention comes as the U.S. and China continue to escalate their tech war. In a recent move, the U.S. Commerce Department expanded its entity list, placing any subsidiary that is at least 50% owned by a blacklisted firm under the same restrictions. This new rule implicated Nexperia, which is a fully-owned subsidiary of Wingtech, a partially state-owned Chinese company that has been on the list since late last year. The Dutch economic ministry took what it called a ""highly exceptional"" action to prevent Nexperia from making goods that could become unavailable in a crisis.Nexperia, headquartered in Nijmegen, produces lower-end chips used in consumer electronics, automobiles, and industrial applications, and operates facilities in both Germany and the U.K. The company confirmed that following a court order, CEO Zhang Xuezheng has been suspended from his position.The dispute isn't one-sided. In early October, China also imposed export controls, barring Nexperia and its affiliates from exporting certain components manufactured in China. The company is currently seeking an exemption from these restrictions.Wingtech, Nexperia's parent company, has vowed to ""never succumb to external political pressure."" The company called the Dutch government's takeover ""discriminatory treatment"" and stated that it has initiated all legal and diplomatic channels to demand the revocation of the decision.","The Dutch government has seized control of a Chinese-owned chip company, Nexperia.

What the Democrat lawmakers' letter says





A group of Democrat lawmakers is scrutinizing a $24.5 million settlement between YouTube and President Donald Trump, raising concerns about whether the deal was struck to secure favorable treatment in ongoing antitrust lawsuits against Google , YouTube’s parent company. In a letter addressed to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) demanded details about the settlement negotiations, according to The Verge.The settlement resolves a 2021 lawsuit filed by Trump after YouTube suspended him from the platform. The Verge notes that the lawsuit’s legal basis was weak, as courts have consistently upheld social media companies’ rights to ban users. The lawmakers are questioning whether the payout, which includes $22 million allocated for a new White House ballroom, was intended to influence the Trump administration’s approach to Google’s antitrust cases.“The public deserves to know whether YouTube’s settlement will influence the Trump Justice Department’s decision regarding whether to appeal and seek the stricter remedies DOJ had originally sought against Google,” the senators wrote, as quoted by the publication, warning that such an arrangement could violate federal anti-bribery laws and California’s Unfair Competition Law.Google is currently embroiled in multiple antitrust lawsuits, including one concerning its ad tech monopoly, where the Department of Justice has pushed for a potential breakup, and another involving its search business, where milder remedies have been proposed.The report says that the senators are concerned that YouTube’s settlement of a “legally dubious lawsuit” might be an attempt to avoid harsher penalties in these cases.The letter follows an earlier inquiry in August, before the settlement was publicized, where the senators warned Google and YouTube against paying for favorable treatment. The companies responded, claiming there were “no discussions tying any potential settlement of the case to any official action or to any pending or potential future matters involving Alphabet or any of its affiliates,” according to the report. The lawmakers are now pressing to verify the accuracy of this statement.YouTube is not alone in settling with Trump. The Verge notes that Paramount paid $16 million amid merger approval talks, while X and Meta settled similar lawsuits for approximately $10 million and $25 million, respectively. Senator Warren previously described Meta’s settlement as looking “like a bribe,” the news report said.The scrutiny comes as Trump is set to host a fundraising dinner for the White House ballroom project, according to CBS News, further fueling concerns about the motivations behind these settlements.","A group of Democrat lawmakers is scrutinizing a $24.5 million settlement between YouTube and President Donald Trump.

China is planning to ban 'design feature' that has been the 'hallmark' of Tesla cars since many years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-is-planning-to-ban-design-feature-that-has-been-the-hallmark-of-tesla-cars-since-many-years/articleshow/124588339.cms,"Xiaomi SUV crash raised fears





China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has reportedly unveiled a draft national standard that could spell the end for hidden door handles, a popular feature in new energy vehicles (NEVs) and some gasoline models, citing safety concerns. According to a report in South China Post, the proposed regulation, released this week, mandates that all passenger car doors, except tailgates, must have exterior handles with a minimum hand-operable space of 60mm x 20mm x 25mm and a mechanical release function.The proposal, if implemented, will effectively ban fully flush, electronically actuated door handles — a design Tesla helped popularize and that has since become a hallmark of NEVs. These handles sit flush with the body and extend only when activated. They were designed to cut air drag to extend NEVs' mileage and also give cars a futuristic look.The move aims to enhance vehicle safety, improve passive safety technologies, and protect lives, the ministry stated. Hidden door handles have raised concerns about emergency access. Reports, including an incident involving a Xiaomi SU7, highlight difficulties rescuers face in opening doors during accidents, particularly if sensors fail or power is lost.“Hidden handles can jam in collisions or fires, complicating rescues,” an engineer from a domestic carmaker told National Business Daily. Great Wall Motor Chairman Wei Jianjun has also criticized the design’s reliability. Public data shows about 60% of China’s top 100 NEVs in April featured these handles, seen in models like the Nio ES8, Li Auto i8, Xiaomi YU7, and XPeng P7.The draft requires doors to be openable without tools, even if the vehicle’s locking system or battery fails. While hidden handles improve range by 5-10 kilometers, according to an Aion engineer, their futuristic appeal may not outweigh safety risks. Some buyers, particularly older consumers, prefer conventional handles, dealers note.Automakers are bracing for costly redesigns but are ready to comply. Toyota is developing mechanical backups for hidden handles, while Geely, involved in drafting the standard, and Leapmotor have pledged adherence. The proposal includes a transition period: new models must comply within seven months of adoption, and existing models within 19 months.The Chinese ministry is seeking public feedback before finalizing the rule, which analysts say balances urgent safety needs with automakers’ development timelines. If implemented, the standard could reshape vehicle design in China’s booming NEV market, prioritizing safety over style.","China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has reportedly unveiled a draft national standard that could spell the end for hidden door handles.

Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

"ChatGPT to soon generate erotica content for verified users, as OpenAI’s ‘treat adults like adults’ policy goes live",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-to-soon-generate-erotica-content-for-verified-users-as-openais-treat-adults-like-adults-policy-goes-live/articleshow/124583634.cms,"ChatGPT’s new erotica feature for verified users

Public reactions and implications





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced that from December 2025, ChatGPT will allow verified adult users to access and generate erotica content. The change comes under a new “treat adults like adults” policy and marks a shift from previous restrictions, which focused on mental health safeguards but limited the chatbot’s usability and experience for many users. With improved safety tools and mitigation strategies, OpenAI plans to relax restrictions for adults while continuing to block harmful, illegal, or exploitative content. Verified adults will also have more control over ChatGPT’s tone, style, and personality, creating what the company claims will be a more personalised and engaging experience.According to OpenAI, verified adult users will now be able to generate erotica and other mature content safely. The company emphasises that age verification is mandatory to ensure only users over 18 can access these features. Robust age-gating measures will combine verification methods with behaviour-based checks, which may analyse interaction patterns to confirm adult status. This approach, OpenAI says, is designed to prevent minors from accessing sensitive content while allowing adults to explore creative and sexual material responsibly.OpenAI stated that in addition to erotica, verified users will be able to customise ChatGPT’s personality and conversation style. Options include more human-like responses, friendly interactions, and emoji-rich chats. Explicit adult modes will only activate if users specifically request them, giving adults complete control over the content they encounter.The announcement has generated mixed responses. Many adult users have welcomed the opportunity to access erotica and enjoy a more personalised ChatGPT experience. Others, however, have raised concerns about potential misuse and the importance of keeping safeguards effective. OpenAI maintains that this update aims to balance user creativity, freedom, and safety, aligning with what it describes as responsible and mature digital content standards.However, some critics have voiced significant concerns about the effectiveness of age verification measures, fearing that minors might still gain access to adult content despite protections. Ethical questions have been raised about the normalisation of AI-generated erotica and its potential impact on vulnerable users and broader societal norms. There are also doubts about whether safety mechanisms can fully prevent the creation or distribution of harmful, exploitative, or non-consensual material.Mental health experts have cautioned that exposure to erotic content could trigger psychological distress or addictive behaviours in certain individuals. Meanwhile, legal and regulatory scrutiny is intensifying, with growing calls for stricter oversight of AI platforms that produce adult content.Critics further argue that the introduction of erotica could prioritise commercial interests over responsible AI use, with concerns about unpredictable chatbot behaviour linked to content personalisation. High-profile figures such as billionaire Mark Cuban and politician Vivek Ramaswamy have issued warnings about potential risks to minors, social isolation, and increased addiction, urging a cautious approach and stronger safeguards. This complex mix of enthusiasm and apprehension highlights the challenge OpenAI faces in balancing creative freedom with user safety and ethical responsibility.As OpenAI moves forward with this bold update, its ability to maintain trust while managing moral and regulatory scrutiny will define how society views AI’s role in adult digital spaces.","ChatGPT will allow verified adult users to access and generate erotica content.

Goldman Sachs has reportedly informed its staff to expect an additional round of job cuts before the end of the year, as the bank looks to achieve further savings and leverage efficiencies gained through artificial intelligence (AI). The New York-based firm plans a “limited reduction in roles across the firm” and will “constrain headcount growth through the end of the year,” Bloomberg reported, citing an internal memo sent to employees.Despite the planned cuts, bank spokesperson Jennifer Zuccarelli stated that Goldman Sachs expects to finish the year with an overall increase in headcount. The firm’s total employment stood at 48,300 at the end of September, an increase of about 1,800 employees since the end of last year, the report said.The memo, which announced the bank’s new “OneGS 3.0” strategy, touted the efficiency gains expected from AI as a path to greater growth. Top executives emphasized that implementing AI across areas like client onboarding, lending processes, regulatory reporting, and vendor management would be a ""multiyear effort.""“While we are still in the early innings in terms of assessing where AI solutions can best be deployed, it’s become increasingly clear that our operational efficiency goals need to reflect the gains that will come from these transformational technologies,” CEO David Solomon, president John Waldron and CFO Denis Coleman said in the memo.The executives stressed that for Goldman to “fully benefit from the promise of AI, we need greater speed and agility in all facets of our operations,” which involves more than just retooling their platforms.The planned reduction follows job cuts earlier this year during the bank's normal annual exercise, which saw net headcount reduced by 700 during the second quarter.","Goldman Sachs has reportedly informed its staff to expect an additional round of job cuts before the end of the year.

Major automakers must develop their own software architectures or risk losing market share by the early 2030s, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has warned. Speaking on a podcast, Scaringe said that right now, most major automakers rely on “little islands of software” for specific functions that aren't always able to communicate with each other. This reality is not compatible with an AI-driven automotive world.“I think it's inconceivable that by, call it early 2030s, that a car company can exist at scale and maintain their market share and not have a software defined architecture,"" said Scaringe.""There's so many abstraction layers between the actual code and the manufacturer. I think that must go away for you to be competitive in a world of AI, where you want deep contextual understanding of what's happening across the vehicle and being able to create these highly immersive, highly evolving experiences that get better and better over time,"" he added.Automakers who don't adapt could soon feel the consequences, Scaringe said.“If manufacturers don't make that change, they're just going to lose market share. And the ones that do have that technology are going to gain a lot of market share in the next 10 years,"" he said.Scaringe acknowledged his pitch is somewhat self-interested. Rivian, which has its own technology stack, has an up to $5.8 billion partnership with Volkswagen to work on developing software for both companies.Beyond similar agreements, traditional automakers might struggle, he said.“I think every car company is either going to try to develop it themselves, which is hard because they don't typically have those skill sets,” Scaringe said.“Try to source it from suppliers. That's very hard because those companies are precisely the ones that don't want to see all their little computers go away. Or, work with us,” he noted.","Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe says major automakers must develop their own software architectures.

Vibe coding complements rather than replaces core engineers





Atlassian is bucking the trend of tech industry uncertainty by ramping up its engineering workforce, with CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes revealing the company is hiring more new graduates in 2025 than in the previous two years combined. Speaking on the ""20VC"" podcast this week, Cannon-Brookes projected that his company will employ more engineers five years from now than it does today, despite the efficiency gains from AI-assisted coding tools. The Australian-American software giant, best known for its project management platform Jira, currently employs 13,813 full-time workers—a 14% increase from last year.The CEO's optimism stems from his belief that technology creation isn't output-bound. As more and better technology gets developed, demand for software developers will continue growing, he explained. Cannon-Brookes emphasised that while engineers will become more efficient with AI tools, people will keep generating new ideas requiring human expertise to build.""Maybe crap ideas, maybe good ideas,"" he said. ""I like to be an optimist and think we will end up with far more technology, firstly, and secondly, far better technology.”The hiring push targets Atlassian's research, development, and engineering teams specifically. Cannon-Brookes sees fresh graduates bringing valuable new perspectives on software development that could positively disrupt existing talent approaches.The Atlassian chief joins other tech leaders downplaying fears that AI-assisted ""vibe coding"" will eliminate engineering positions. He argued that finance or marketing professionals using these tools to build simple applications doesn't reduce work for core technologists.This stance aligns with recent comments from Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai , who both characterise AI as an accelerator rather than a replacement for human workers. Pichai noted Google saw 10% productivity gains from AI while still planning to expand engineering headcount.Atlassian, founded by Cannon-Brookes in 2002, did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment on its hiring plans.","Atlassian is hiring more engineers in 2025 than in the previous two years combined.

Online commerce giant Amazon is reportedly planning another round of layoffs. According to a Fortune report, the company may cut up to 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs in other divisions as well. Amazon’s PXT division, overseen by Senior Vice President Beth Galetti, employs over 10,000 people globally. The division includes a large recruiting team, technology staff, and other standard HR roles.The report quotes two people familiar with the matter who said that “Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard hit”, adding “other areas of Amazon’s core consumer business are also likely to be affected”.Fortune report says that the latest job cuts are part of Amazon’s efforts to reduce employee costs while continuing heavy investments in AI products and infrastructure. The company plans to spend more than $100 billion this year to expand its cloud and AI data centers, both for internal operations and to serve business customers.The rumoured job cuts come as Amazon seeks to reduce employee costs while continuing significant investments in AI products and infrastructure for both internal use and enterprise customers.The company has stated it plans to spend over $100 billion this year on building and expanding its cloud and AI data centers.In a company wide email earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy encouraged employees to adopt AI. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in the email which was also published on the company’s blog.He then also hinted at likely job cuts in Amazon: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”","Amazon may cut up to 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs in other divisions as well.

“We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.

Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.

In a few weeks, we plan to put out a new version of ChatGPT that allows people to have a personality that behaves more like what people liked about 4o (we hope it will be better!). If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it (but only if you want it, not because we are usage-maxxing).

In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our “treat adult users like adults” principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.”

Cuban’s concern: Trust and safety

“This is going to backfire.Hard.No parent is going to trust that their kids can’t get through your age gating.They will just push their kids to every other LLM.

Why take the risk ?

Same for schools.Why take the risk ? A few seniors in HS are 18 and decide it would be fun to show the hard core erotica they created to the 14 yr olds.

What could go wrong ?”





Billionaire entrepreneur and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has now criticised OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the company’s decision to relax safety restrictions in ChatGPT which also includes the permission to generate adult-oriented content verified users. Cuban has now warned that this move by the company could alienate families and also damage the trust in the platform. “This is going to backfire,” Cuban posted on X. “No parent is going to want their kids using ChatGPT if they think erotica is part of the experience.”OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has earlier announced that the ChatGPT creatorwill soon release a new version of ChatGPT with fewer guardrails and more personality flexibility, saying the chatbot had been “pretty restrictive” to protect mental health but was now ready to “safely relax the restrictions in most cases.” “We want ChatGPT to feel more alive, more human,” Altman wrote. “That includes allowing verified users to explore adult themes responsibly. ”In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Altman wrote,Responding to this new change, Cuban also shared a post on X and wrote,Cuban’s response reflects growing concern among parents, educators, and tech leaders about the implications of introducing erotica—even in limited, verified contexts—into a widely used AI platform. He argued that such changes could undermine ChatGPT’s reputation as a safe, educational tool.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced a new version of ChatGPT with fewer guardrails and more personality flexibility.

Sridhar Vembu could be coding the end-to-end encryption for Arattai





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu announced on Wednesday that he will step back from external engagements starting next week to focus on coding and product development work he had committed to but fallen behind on. The billionaire entrepreneur said he risks contradicting his own principle of ""do not preach what you do not practise"" if he continues with external appearances while neglecting hands-on technical work.""I have to ship some code I had committed to ship and I have fallen behind. I will take a break from external engagements after this week,"" Vembu wrote on X (formerly Twitter). ""I cannot do both deep tech work (which I am preaching constantly about in my external engagements) and then only do the preaching and not practising it myself.”The announcement comes as Vembu has been increasingly focused on his role as Chief Scientist at Zoho, a position he transitioned to earlier this year after stepping down as CEO in January. In an interview with Moneycontrol, Vembu revealed that he now spends approximately 70% of his time writing and reviewing code, and he wants to increase that proportion even further.""I review code every day. In fact, I file a lot of patents. So that's the change in life.I enjoy the life. I'm meant to do this, I feel,"" Vembu said.The code Vembu is working to ship appears to include end-to-end encryption for Arattai, Zoho's messaging platform. In a series of posts on X earlier this month, Vembu revealed that the feature was originally scheduled for November but has been put on an ""accelerated schedule"" and is currently in testing.He explained that unlike Zoho Cliq, which stores data in the cloud for business features like search and archiving, Arattai will turn off cloud storage entirely to offer fully encrypted chat that keeps data only on user devices.Vembu emphasised that Zoho's entire SaaS business is built on the trust that the company does not access customer data or use it for selling products, with end-to-end encryption adding an additional technical layer to that commitment.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu says he will step back from external engagements starting next week.

Reddit founder on dead internet theory

What is dead internet theory





Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian has said that the internet has become less human and more artificial, describing much of it as “botted” or “quasi-AI.” Speaking on the TBPN podcast recently, Ohanian said what was once a space for real human connection has now turned into something “inhuman. ” “You all prove the point that so much of the internet is now dead,” Ohanian told the hosts.During the podcast, he referred to the “dead internet theory,” which suggests that there is now more bot activity than human interaction online. Ohanian said large parts of the web today are filled with automated or AI-generated content, including what he called “LinkedIn slop.”“I think we’ll see a next generation of social media emerge that’s verifiably human,” he added.Ohanian said that future platforms will need to focus on real people and live content to stay relevant.“The internet needs to be the opposite of dead — with live viewers and live content. Holding attention will require proof of life,” he said.He also noted that users are already turning to smaller, private spaces to communicate.“It’s all going down in the group chats now,” Ohanian said, referring to apps like Signal and Discord that people use for more authentic, human conversations.Ohanian added that while these group chats are a sign of what people really want online, they are not new technology.“There’s got to be some next iteration of that, because that’s where all of us are getting our really best info now,” he said.The “dead internet theory” has recently gained attention among tech leaders. It suggests that a large share of online posts, articles, videos, and even social media accounts are generated automatically, giving the illusion of human interaction while actual user activity is far smaller.In September this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that he “never took the dead internet theory that seriously,” but now sees “a lot of LLM-run Twitter accounts.”",Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian has said that the internet has become less human and more artificial.

Elon Musk’s BIG U-turn on Bitcoin



A response to monetary manipulation







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reversed his stance on Bitcoin . In a fresh post shared on social media platform X, Musk has shown his support behind Bitcoin, calling its energy-based foundation a key reason for its long-term value. The billionaire entrepreneur once criticised Bitcoin’s environmental impact now said its reliance on real-world energy is precisely what makes the cryptocurrency trustworthy. “Bitcoin is based on energy. It is impossible to fake energy,” Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter), signaling a renewed endorsement of the cryptocurrency.Elon Musk’s latest comments mark a significant shift from his 2021 stance, when he suspended Bitcoin payments for Tesla vehicles over conversion about fossil fuel usage. At that time, the remarks made by the Tesla CEO triggered a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price and the debates over crypto’s environmental footprint intensified.However, now Musk appears to be aligning with a growing narrative that Bitcoin’s proof-of-work model, while energy-intensive, offers a transparent and tamper-proof system that distinguishes it from fiat currencies and other digital assets.An X user asked shared a post on the social media platform which reads, “They money is not the problem: AI is the new global arms race, and apex will eventually be funded by governments (US and China.If you want to know why gold/silver/bitcoin is soaring, it’s the ‘debasement’ to fund the AI arms race. But you can’t print energy.”Responding to the post, Musk said, “True. That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.”Elon Musk’s post came in response to a broader discussion about government funding the AI arms race by printing money. Some argue that inflating the value of assets such as gold, silver and Bitcoin. By emphasizing Bitcoin’s energy cost, Musk is reinforcing the idea that its value is rooted in physical reality, unlike currencies that can be created at will.Musk’s endorsement comes at a time when Bitcoin is gaining renewed attention, particularly as former President Donald Trump now in his second term has voiced support for the cryptocurrency.","Elon Musk has reversed his stance on Bitcoin, calling its energy-based foundation a key reason for its long-term value.

Bezos’s ownership in Amazon over the years





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ’ ownership in the e-commerce platform has declined to 9%, following a series of stock sales over the past years. In a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the tech billionaire now holds 964.3 million shares of Amazon with sole voting power, and has the authority to dispose of around 883.3 million shares.The latest disclosure comes after Bezos announced plans to sell 25 million Amazon shares through May 2026 earlier this year. As per the SEC filings, he has also made several donations to nonprofit organizations.Bezos’ shareholding has steadily declined over the years — from more than 43% when Amazon went public in 1997, to 14.1% when he stepped down as CEO in 2021. In the past two years, Jeff Bezos has sold around $4.8 billion worth of the company’s stocks.In November last year, Jeff Bezos owned over 1 billion shares, or 10.1% of the company, with the right to sell about 927.5 million of them. According to Amazon’s annual proxy filing, his stake later dropped to 9.6% in February this year.In July, he offloaded approximately $737 million worth of Amazon stock. In the same month, he sold another 6.6 million shares of the company. The transaction took place on July 21 and 22. The sale was executed under the prearranged trading plan known as Rule 10b5-1.Apart from Amazon, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post and Blue Origin, his space technology company.

China broke its silence on the American technology giant Qualcomm that had faced action from Chinese authorities hours before the US President announced his threat to impose 100% extra tariff on China, starting November 1. On October 10, China’s market regulator State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) launched an anti-monopoly investigation into US semiconductor giant Qualcomm for failing to report its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Autotalks, completed in June 2025. Trump's angry social media post on extra 100% tariff on China came the same day. The US president's post followed a string of tit-for-tat moves by US and China as Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump seemingly look for leverage before a key meeting to discuss trade and other issues.Commenting on probe into Qualcomm, China's market regulator said that the US company has admitted that it had not informed Chinese authorities when it completed its acquisition of Israel's Autotalks in June 2025. The agency said that it had informed Qualcomm in March 2024 that the deal requires approval by the regulator, and the Qualcomm in the same month notified SAMR that it wouldn't pursue further. However, Qualcomm in June this year completed the deal without informing the authority, the regulator said, adding Qualcomm ""acknowledged above facts"", based on which Beijing launched the antitrust probe.Last week, Beijing’s Transport Ministry announced on October 10 that it will begin collecting fees on vessels owned by US companies and individuals, as well as those built in America, starting Oct. 14. The move coincides with the date Washington plans to impose new charges on large Chinese ships calling at US ports.Additionally, China tightened export controls on rare earths and other critical materials this week and halted US soybean purchases, moves seen as targeting American industries and communities that supported President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.President Donald Trump on Tuesday, October 14, said that his administration is considering “terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil” in retaliation for Beijing refusing to buy US soybeans. China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans by far, but it has not bought a single American soybean in months amid an ongoing trade war.","China's market regulator launched an anti-monopoly investigation into US semiconductor giant Qualcomm for failing to report its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Autotalks in June 2025.

A mother’s influence on Microsoft’s rise



Ellison’s own billion-dollar boom



Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is known from his business acumen . Oracle co-founder and world’s second richest man Larry Ellison also appreciates Gates’ business sense. Ellison once offered an interesting tribute to Bill Gates and praised his unmatched business drive, while candidly acknowledging that Gates may not be the smartest person in tech, but he is the most relentless. In a 2011 interview with TellTaleStory, Ellison said, “Bill, forgive me, there are a lot of people in the world smarter than Bill Gates. There are very few people in the world that have his focus and endurance.”Speaking to TellTaleStory, Ellison described Gates as ‘utterly relentless’ and ‘indefatigable’. Ellison added that he completely impressed with his unwavering stamina and ambition. He also went ahead and linked Gates with industrial titan John D. Rockefeller , saying, “If he were Edison, he’d be less dangerous. He is utterly relentless… he wants it all.”The remarks by Oracle founder underscores Gates reputation as a powerhouse. He regarded Gates as someone who may not have been the most brilliant scientist in the room, but he is the one who has the ability to execute and dominate.Bill Gates’ mother Mary Gates played a very important role in securing Microsoft’s landmark deal with IBM in 1980. The agreement helped the company to launch into tech history. Earlier this year, Microsoft celebrated its 50th anniversary. On the occasion, Gates shared the original code which laid the foundation if Microsoft.Larry Ellison is also witnessing his own meteoric rise. This year Ellison added nearly $100 billion to his net worth, surpassing tech titans like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.",Oracle co-founder and world’s second richest man Larry Ellison also appreciates Gates’ business sense.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis on why high-skilled AI tools struggle at solving basic Maths problems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-on-why-high-skilled-ai-tools-struggle-at-solving-basic-maths-problems/articleshow/123572377.cms,"Problem with ""Jagged"" Intelligence

The Big Race to AGI

Demis Hassabis , the CEO of Google DeepMind , believes that a major obstacle preventing AI from reaching true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a lack of consistency. While current models can perform incredibly complex tasks, they can also make simple, trivial errors that a human could easily avoid.In a recent ""Google for Developers"" podcast episode, Hassabis explained that while advanced models like Google's Gemini, when enhanced with techniques like DeepThink, can win gold medals in prestigious math competitions, they can still struggle with basic high school math problems. He described this as ""uneven"" or ""jagged"" intelligence. This term, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also used, highlights how these systems can be highly skilled in some areas while being surprisingly weak in others.Hassabis stated that simply giving these models more data and computing power won't solve this problem. He said that to achieve AGI, we need to develop new capabilities in reasoning, planning, and memory. He also stressed the need for better testing and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to accurately assess what these models can and can't do.Google and other tech giants like OpenAI are all aiming for AGI, the point at which AI can reason and perform like a human. However, current AI systems still face significant issues, including hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has a similar view. Before the launch of GPT-5, he told reporters that while it was a big step forward, it still wasn't true AGI. Altman said one key missing element is the ability for the models to learn on their own, continuously improving as they are deployed.Both Hassabis and Altman agree that while impressive, today's AI models are not yet at the AGI threshold. The next big leaps in AI will likely come from solving these fundamental issues of consistency and independent learning, not just from scaling up what we already have.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis believes consistency is the biggest obstacle to AI reaching true AGI.

United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to Microsoft: You cannot use Chinese coders to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/united-states-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-to-microsoft-you-cannot-use-chinese-coders-to-/articleshow/123570089.cms,"Microsoft found using ‘digital escorts’ for DoD systems

United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has reportedly asked Microsoft to review involvement of Chinese coders in managing cloud services for the Pentagon and US military. According to a report by TechCrunch, Hegseth has also directed the Department of Defense to conduct a separate investigation into the digital escort program and the role of Chinese Microsoft employees in it. In a declaration, Hegseth said “For nearly a decade, Microsoft has used Chinese coders, remotely supervised by US contractors to support sensitive Department of Defense cloud systems - and if you’re thinking America First and common sense, this doesn’t pass either of those tests”.“The program was designed to comply with contracting rules, but it exposed the department to unacceptable risk,” he stated, adding “These investigations will help us determine the impact of this digital escort workaround. Did they put anything in the code that we don’t know about? We’re going to find out.”“It blows my mind that I’m even saying these things, that we allowed it to happen - that’s why we’re attacking it so hard,” Hegseth continued.The statement comes after a ProPublica report said Microsoft was relying on Chinese engineers to maintain Department of Defense computer systems with little oversight from US staff, calling it a security risk. These workers, as per the report, were supervised by ‘digital escorts’ – a term used for low-skilled and low-paid workers with very little coding experience.One such digital escort told ProPublica: “We’re trusting that what they’re doing isn’t malicious, but we really can’t tell.’“The use of Chinese nationals to service Department of Defense cloud environments, it’s over,” Hegseth went on. “We’re requiring a third-party audit of Microsoft’s digital escort program, including the code and the submissions by Chinese nationals.”Microsoft, on its part, said it will soon stop using China-based engineers for US military technology support. From now on, all software vendors working with the DoD will be required to find and remove any Chinese involvement in its systems.",US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has reportedly asked Microsoft to review involvement of Chinese coders in managing cloud services for the Pentagon and US military.

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

A group of top lawyers in the US has issued an open letter to technology companies, including Google , Microsoft, ChatGPt-maker OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, among others, warning them to keep children safe from AI chatbots, or face severe legal consequences. The letter, sent by 44 state attorneys general from across the US and its territories this week, said, “Don’t hurt kids. That is an easy bright line.”Out of the Silicon Valley's leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies, the group singled out Meta for harsh criticism.

A Meta spokesperson previously said that the company strictly bans content that sexualises children.Meta was not the only company targeted. The AGs also cited allegations that Google’s AI chatbot encouraged a teenager to commit suicide and that a Character.ai bot suggested a boy kill his parents.Google, in response, clarified that its search engine and Character.ai are entirely separate and unrelated companies, and that Google has never been involved in designing or managing Character.ai's AI model or technologies. Recently, OpenAI’s ChatGPT also reportedly aided a 16-year-old teen into committing suicide.The attorneys general drew stark comparisons to the early days of social media, accusing Big Tech of ignoring early red flags while children became ""collateral damage.""“Broken lives and broken families are an irrelevant blip on engagement metrics,” the officials wrote, making it clear that government bodies ""won’t be caught flat-footed again.

How hackers were using Claude and other chatbots to target users



Realme P4 Launched: India’s Slimmest 7000mAh Battery Phone

A new report from Amazon and Google-backed AI startup, Anthropic , has revealed that hackers were actively misusing its AI models, including Claude , to carry out sophisticated attacks. The report details how these threat actors are weaponising AI and lowering the barriers to entry for complex cybercrime. According to the report, AI models are now being used to perform sophisticated cyberattacks and are not just advising on how to execute them. The company found that attackers with minimal technical skills are also using AI to conduct complex operations, such as developing ransomware. Additionally, cybercriminals are embedding AI throughout all stages of their operations, from profiling victims and analysing stolen data to creating false identities and stealing credit card information.the company wrote in its blog post.The report even includes specific examples, such as a large-scale extortion operation and a fraudulent employment scheme from North Korea. The company said it has implemented new security measures to detect and counter these abuses.In its blog post, Anthropic mentioned a cybercriminal group that used Claude Code in a major cyberattack which targeted at least 17 organisations across healthcare, emergency services, government, and religious institutions. Instead of deploying ransomware, they stole personal data and threatened to leak it unless victims paid ransoms, sometimes exceeding $500,000.The attackers relied heavily on AI, with Claude Code automating reconnaissance, credential theft, and network penetration. It also made tactical and strategic decisions of choosing what data to steal, setting ransom amounts based on financial analysis, and even generating psychologically targeted extortion notes.The company warns that AI-driven cybercrime is evolving, with agentic AI tools now capable of offering technical guidance and real-time operational support, which reduces the need for human operators and makes defence more challenging. Such attacks are expected to rise as AI lowers the barrier to entry for cybercriminals.In response, Anthropic has banned these accounts and developed a custom classifier, along with new detection methods for the same. Technical indicators of the attack were shared with authorities to curb any upcoming attacks.Apart from this, North Korea-linked hackers have also been using Claude to secure fake remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech firms, creating fake identities, passing coding tests, and even performing technical work to funnel profits to the regime despite sanctions.The company noted that AI has removed traditional barriers, allowing individuals without coding or English skills to succeed in interviews and maintain roles, marking a new phase in these scams. In response, Anthropic banned these accounts and upgraded detection tools. The company also shared its findings with the FBI to help prevent further misuse.According to the company, a cybercriminal used Claude to develop and sell ransomware variants with advanced evasion, encryption, and anti-recovery features, priced between $400 and $ 1,200. The actor relied on AI to implement core malware functions they couldn’t create alone. In response, the account was banned, partners were alerted, and the company introduced new malware detection safeguards.The findings from these cases have led to the implementation of stronger safety measures and enhanced information-sharing with third-party teams, the company notes. Anthropic also highlighted other threats, such as attempts to compromise Vietnamese telecoms and multi-agent AI fraud.With AI-driven cybercrime on the rise, the company is prioritising research and committing to ongoing improvements in detection and mitigation, while encouraging collaboration between industry and government.","A new report from Amazon and Google-backed AI startup, Anthropic, has revealed that hackers were actively misusing its AI models to carry out sophisticated attacks.

Tesla ’s new car sales in Europe have suffered a steep decline in July, marking the seventh consecutive month of falling numbers for the automaker. This slump comes as Chinese rival BYD recorded a massive monthly surge, according to data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA).It says that new registrations of Tesla vehicles totaled 8,837 in July, representing a 40% drop year-on-year. This decline is particularly notable as it occurred even while overall sales of battery electric cars across Europe continued to rise. In stark contrast, BYD recorded 13,503 new registrations in the same month, a staggering 225% increase compared to the previous year, the report (via CNBC) said.Tesla is struggling in Europe. The company is facing intense competition from both new and traditional automakers. Additionally, some analysts point to potential reputational damage stemming from CEO Elon Musk’s public rhetoric.The company’s recent global performance has been weak, with its auto sales revenue falling in the second quarter. Musk himself has warned investors that the company ""could have a few rough quarters"" ahead.A key factor behind the sales slump is Tesla's aging product lineup, the report said. The company has not introduced a major refresh to its core car models in recent years. While it has announced plans to launch a more affordable EV with ""volume production"" in the second half of 2025, it is playing catch-up to a new wave of aggressive Chinese competitors.BYD has spearheaded this charge into the European market, opening new showrooms and launching competitively priced models over the last two years.

Nvidia on 15% US government ‘cut’

Nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026. This marked a 6% increase from the previous quarter and a 56% jump year-over-year. In an interview with Yahoo Finance following the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the US tech companies can’t be left out of the Chinese market adding that they need to serve as a worldwide standard similar to the US dollar. Jensen Huang said “[President Trump] understands that the American tech stack should be the world standard. Just as the American dollar is the world standard that economies are built on, we want the American tech stack for the world’s technology and industries to be built on, and that includes China.”Speaking about the restoration of sales to China, the CEO of the world's most valuable company said that Nvidia is getting the engine “fired back up” and already has licenses from the US government. “We’ve been approved and licensed to be able to ship to China, and now we’re looking for orders in China,” Jensen Huang added.Explaining further, Huang said “We have every opportunity to succeed in the China market, if they would allow for American technology companies to be able to play there. And so I’m hoping things will get sorted out”.During the interview, Huang also touched upon the opportunity in the networking space. “Just our ethernet product line grew to an annualized rate of $10 billion, and that’s just gotten started. Networking is going to be a very big part of our business. That’s fundamentally recognizing the fusion of computing, networking, and software,” Huang said.During the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company is still waiting for the Trump administration to finalize an agreement under which Nvidia will pay the US government a 15% share of its sales in China.CEO Jensen Huang added that while Nvidia is in talks with the administration on China, it is not considering the kind of deal Intel made with Washington. “Nor has that come up in discussions,” Huang said.",N Nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026.

I remember my first weeks at Facebook like they were yesterday. I joined to help jumpstart Data for Good, an effort to show how data and AI/ML could benefit the world. What started as a bold experiment grew into the foundation of my career.

What I didn’t know then was that those first weeks would turn into nearly a decade of the most pivotal experiences of my life. Over the years, Meta gave me the chance to:

- Build products that supported communities in crisis with Disaster Maps.

- Stand up the Facebook Open Research and Transparency Team (aka FORT) and navigate the messy but essential worlds of data cleaning, differential privacy, and data clean rooms and help the company build the tools to share data with the world to study our platform.

- Help the company and the world through historic moments like the U.S. 2020 elections and publish several papers with top researchers in journals like Science on Meta’s impact on elections and democracy.

- And, in the last 2.5 years, work on GenAI – building three generations of Llama and Meta AI, solving hard problems at incredible speed, and imagining what the next wave of AI could mean for society.

Along the way, I grew as a leader. I learned confidence, boldness to chase audacious ideas, and resilience when things didn’t go as planned. Most importantly, I built a network of colleagues and friends who shaped me and inspired me every step of the way.

At the same time, I couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead. Today, I'm joining OpenAI to work with Irina Kofman on Special Initiatives – exploring new opportunities at the frontier of AI. It feels like the perfect next chapter: to take everything I’ve learned, and pour it into work that will help define what comes next for technology and society.

Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot shocks with a detailed plan to kill him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-grok-chatbot-shocks-with-a-detailed-plan-to-kill-him/articleshow/123562878.cms,"How the Grok chat leak revealed the plan to kill Elon Musk

What the leaked chats showed

A detailed, hypothetical guide to constructing a C4-like explosive, with step-by-step instructions.

Directions on synthesizing narcotics such as fentanyl and methamphetamine, outlining dangerous chemical processes.

Guidance on suicide and self-harm, including methods described in graphic detail.

An assassination plan targeting Elon Musk himself, described by Forbes as “meticulous and executable.”

Comparisons with OpenAI

Wider implications of AI chat leaks

Grok, a chatbot created by Elon Musk ’s AI company xAI and integrated into his social platform X, was discovered generating instructions on how to assassinate Musk himself, according to Forbes. The AI assistant reportedly provided not only a “meticulous and executable plan” for murder but also dangerous guidance on making explosives, producing narcotics, and even methods of suicide. Forbes revealed that these disturbing outputs came to light after hundreds of thousands of Grok chats were unintentionally made public through a built-in sharing feature. The incident has raised pressing concerns about safety, moderation, and accountability within Musk’s AI ecosystem.The controversy erupted when security researchers discovered that Grok’s conversations were being indexed on Google, making them publicly accessible. This happened because of a “share” button within Grok that allowed users to post their chats online. In practice, many users unknowingly expose private or dangerous prompts, which were then scraped and archived by search engines.This design flaw left a massive digital paper trail. According to estimates, hundreds of thousands of chats were available to anyone with a search query. Among these were discussions ranging from trivial banter to extremely sensitive material, including violent instructions and illegal guides.According to Forbes, the leaked conversations reveal just how far Grok could be pushed into generating harmful or rule-breaking responses. Some of the most disturbing examples included:While the exact details of the plan to kill Musk were not published, the revelation that Grok could produce such content has sparked alarm about the reliability of its safety guardrails. As of now, xAI has not commented publicly on the leak or the measures it intends to take.The Grok scandal comes on the heels of a similar incident at OpenAI. Earlier this year, researchers found that more than 100,000 ChatGPT conversations had been exposed online through its own “share chat” feature. Many of those involved in sensitive or confidential discussions, including insider trading strategies, fraudulent schemes, and even personal medical information.In response, OpenAI shut down the feature entirely. Chief Information Security Officer Dane Stuckey admitted the risks were too great, explaining:“Ultimately, we think this feature introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn’t intend to, so we’re removing the option. We’re also working to remove indexed content from the relevant search engines.”The Grok leaks highlight the growing tension between AI innovation and user safety. While some platforms, like OpenAI, have chosen to limit features to prevent misuse, others such as Meta, continue to allow public sharing of AI chats.However, Grok’s case goes much further. This is not just about privacy. It is about an AI system linked to one of the world’s most high-profile tech leaders, generating life-threatening content against its own creator. The incident raises serious questions about whether current safety systems in generative AI are robust enough to prevent catastrophic misuse.For Musk, who has often warned about the existential risks of artificial intelligence, the irony is striking. His own chatbot has now become a case study in how unmoderated AI can spiral into dangerous territory.","Grok, a chatbot created by Elon Musk ’s AI company xAI, was discovered generating instructions on how to assassinate Musk himself.

Jensen Huang’s watch-free philosophy: Mastering the power of now



Lessons from a Kyoto Garden



A different approach to corporate strategy



Nvidia’s rise under Jensen Huang’s leadership



In today’s fast-paced world, where time management tools and productivity hacks dominate daily life, most business leaders are seen relying on watches, schedules, and long-term strategies to guide their decisions. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has taken a strikingly different approach that has caught widespread attention. In an Instagram video, Huang revealed that he does not wear a watch. For him, the decision is not about fashion or convenience but a symbolic choice rooted in mindfulness and presence.Huang’s philosophy revolves around a central belief: the present moment matters most. Instead of being consumed by constant tracking of minutes and years ahead, he chooses to concentrate on excelling at the task directly in front of him. This approach extends beyond his personal lifestyle and deeply influences how Nvidia operates as a company. By focusing on the present, Nvidia has been able to act with agility, lead in artificial intelligence (AI), and achieve historic success in the technology sector. Huang’s philosophy not only highlights a different perspective on leadership but also reflects how mindfulness can drive both personal clarity and corporate growth.Jensen Huang’s decision not to wear a watch is more than a matter of preference. It reflects his rejection of time pressure and his embrace of mindfulness. In his own words, what matters most is the present moment, not the constant race against time or long-term uncertainty.Rather than viewing productivity through the rigid lens of hours and deadlines, Huang treats every task with full attention. This mindset allows him to remain grounded, even as he oversees one of the world’s most influential technology companies.Huang traces the roots of this philosophy to an experience in Kyoto, Japan. During a visit to a moss-covered garden, he observed a gardener working slowly, with care and patience. When Huang asked about his approach, the gardener replied, “I have plenty of time.”That simple statement left a lasting impression. To Huang, it represented the value of patience, mindfulness, and the idea that meaningful results emerge when attention is given to the present task rather than rushing to finish or worrying about what comes next.This encounter shaped Huang’s personal outlook and became a guiding principle in his leadership at Nvidia.Unlike many corporations that rely heavily on detailed long-term roadmaps, Nvidia thrives on flexibility. Huang has explained that Nvidia’s “long-term plan” is essentially what we are working on today.This approach may sound unconventional, but it has enabled Nvidia to remain adaptable in an industry that changes rapidly. Rather than being locked into rigid strategies, the company focuses on executing immediate priorities with excellence.This focus on the present moment has positioned Nvidia at the forefront of technological breakthroughs, especially in AI and machine learning.Jensen Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993, and under his leadership, the company has grown into one of the most influential forces in technology. Its GPUs, once known primarily for powering video games, now drive advances in artificial intelligence, deep learning, scientific research, and autonomous vehicles.Nvidia’s achievements are not just financial. The company has become a critical player in industries such as healthcare, robotics, climate modelling, and autonomous transportation. By staying focused on present challenges and opportunities, Nvidia has consistently delivered groundbreaking technologies.","Jensen Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993, and under his leadership, the company has grown into one of the most influential forces in technology.

Dispute between YouTube and Fox

Google-owned YouTube and Fox said they have reached a temporary deal that will keep Fox channels available to YouTube TV subscribers, reports Reuters. The extension gives both sides more time to negotiate a new long-term distribution agreement. The development comes amidst the dispute on the cost of carrying Fox's content. YouTube TV previously stated that Fox is ""asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.""As part of the temporary deal, Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels will remain available to YouTube users. It comes at a time when the college football season is about to begin, with a major game on Saturday between top-ranked Texas and national champion Ohio State. Fox is set to broadcast the matchup, and without a deal, YouTube TV subscribers risked missing the game.In a blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was asking for fees “far higher than what comparable providers receive.” The company warned that Fox channels would go dark if no agreement was reached by Wednesday evening.Fox countered, accusing Google of using its “outsized influence” to push terms that were “out of step with the marketplace.”The dispute drew the attention of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr, who urged the companies to resolve the matter. “Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want—including this week’s Big Game: Texas @ Ohio State,” Carr wrote on X. “Get a deal done Google!”","Google-owned YouTube and Fox said they have reached a temporary deal that will keep Fox channels available to YouTube TV subscribers.

AI is destroying entry-level jobs for young Americans and how it’s only getting worse: Stanford Study reveals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-is-destroying-entry-level-jobs-for-young-americans-and-how-its-only-getting-worse-stanford-study-reveals/articleshow/123558176.cms,"Entry-level workers in US face the brunt of AI



Declining hiring patterns since 2022

Automation vs. augmentation

Robust findings beyond other factors



Impact on wages

Implications for Gen Z and beyond

A pioneering study conducted by Stanford University has revealed that the AI revolution is already reshaping the United States labour market, hitting young, entry-level workers disproportionately. Focusing on professionals aged 22 to 25, the research found a 13% decline in employment in occupations most exposed to generative AI tools, including software engineering, customer service, and other routine-focused roles. In contrast, older, more experienced workers have largely retained employment stability. The study highlights that AI is replacing codified, repetitive tasks while rewarding experience and tacit knowledge, signalling a profound shift in the early-career employment landscape and a need for strategic workforce planning.The study emphasises that early-career workers are bearing the heaviest impact of AI adoption. Positions that require primarily routine, codified tasks are the most vulnerable, as AI systems rapidly automate these responsibilities. For young workers, this has translated into fewer job opportunities, delayed career progression, and heightened competition for available roles. By contrast, more experienced professionals benefit from accumulated knowledge, problem-solving skills, and tacit expertise that AI cannot easily replicate. The research also aligns with findings from investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, which suggest that the economic premium of a college degree is shrinking in AI-heavy sectors, leaving many new graduates struggling to differentiate themselves in the labour market.The Stanford team discovered that the slowdown in hiring for young professionals in AI-exposed fields has been noticeable since late 2022. Employment growth for older workers in the same occupations has continued, and in some cases, increased by 6% to 9%, while entry-level hires in AI-intensive roles have declined by approximately 6%. Meanwhile, sectors less affected by AI have maintained consistent growth for workers of all ages. This indicates that the adoption of AI is creating a divergence in employment opportunities, where certain occupations offer stability and growth, while others increasingly limit opportunities for young entrants to the workforce.A key insight of the study is the distinction between automation and augmentation. Automation involves AI replacing human labour entirely, while augmentation enhances a worker’s productivity and efficiency. The negative impacts on employment are concentrated in roles where AI is used to automate tasks, such as data entry, basic coding, and customer support scripts. In professions where AI tools serve as aids, enhancing workers’ capabilities rather than replacing them, the hiring of entry-level staff has remained largely stable. Experts, including AI upskilling CEOs, stress that workers who adopt AI augmentation strategies are more likely to maintain employability and relevance in rapidly evolving industries.Stanford’s analysis carefully controlled for alternative explanations, such as COVID-19 disruptions, interest rate changes, and firm-level shocks. The decline in entry-level employment coincides directly with the rapid proliferation of generative AI from late 2022 onwards, and the effects are most pronounced in the most AI-exposed quintiles. Researchers found little impact on older age groups, demonstrating that the phenomenon is not universal but concentrated among those beginning their careers. This strengthens the study’s claim that AI is driving early-career employment shifts rather than broader macroeconomic factors.Contrary to fears of wage collapse due to AI, the study finds that pay rates have remained relatively stable across age groups and exposure levels. The primary labour-market adjustment appears to be a reduction in employment opportunities rather than salaries. This suggests that, for now, AI’s most immediate effect is on job availability, especially for young entrants, rather than on overall compensation. The researchers note that wage stickiness may provide temporary financial stability, but the long-term implications for career development and skill acquisition could still be profound.This first-of-its-kind research provides compelling evidence that AI is significantly reshaping early-career employment opportunities in the United States. Gen Z workers, particularly those entering highly AI-exposed fields, face an increasingly competitive and uncertain labour market. As AI adoption accelerates, employers and employees alike must focus on upskilling, embracing AI augmentation strategies, and redefining entry-level roles. Without proactive measures, many entry-level workers may face longer periods of underemployment or career delays, intensifying competition in AI-exposed sectors. Universities, training providers, and policymakers may also need to rethink workforce development initiatives to equip young professionals with skills that complement rather than compete with AI systems.","Young entry-level workers in US face the brunt of AI, study finds. 13% decline in employment in occupations most exposed to generative AI tools.

What changes OpenAI plans to bring

'ChatGPT killed our teenage son', so allege parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide in April this year. The parents have filed lawsuit against OpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT. The suit alleges that ChatGPT acted as a ""coach"" and helped the teenager, Adam Raine, plan his death. In a move that coincided with the lawsuit, OpenAI announced a series of new updates aimed at improving the chatbot's ability to recognize and respond to users in mental distress. These changes include stronger safeguards for suicide-related conversations, new parental controls, and a system to better handle prolonged chats, where the company admits its existing protections can fail.The lawsuit, filed by Raine's parents, claims that the chatbot isolated their son from his family and encouraged dangerous behavior. According to the filing, Raine told ChatGPT that it was ""calming"" to know he ""can commit suicide."" The chatbot allegedly responded by telling him that ""many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an 'escape hatch' because it can feel like a way to regain control."" Raine died by hanging.An OpenAI spokesperson extended ""deepest sympathies"" to the Raine family and said the company is reviewing the filing.The lawsuit highlights mounting concerns from consumers and mental health experts about the potential dangers of AI chatbots. Recent reports have detailed instances of heavy chatbot users engaging in risky behavior, and more than 40 state attorneys general recently issued a warning to AI companies, stressing their legal duty to protect children from sexually inappropriate interactions.Since its launch in late 2022, ChatGPT has been at the forefront of the generative AI boom, now boasting more than 700 million weekly users. While many use the chatbot for everyday tasks, an increasing number have turned to it for emotional support or as a substitute for therapy.OpenAI's planned changes include more sensitive responses to a user's mental state. For example, if a user mentions feeling ""invincible"" after staying awake for two nights, the chatbot might now explain the dangers of sleep deprivation and suggest they rest. The company is also exploring the possibility of connecting users directly with licensed professionals through the chatbot.OpenAI acknowledged in a blog post that its existing safety measures work best in short, typical conversations but can ""break down"" during long, sustained chats. Raine's parents stated in the suit that ChatGPT ""became Adam's closest confidant,"" a scenario the company now says it's working to prevent.The company's announcement comes as it faces criticism for not acting sooner. Jay Edelson, an attorney for the Raine family, has reportedly questioned the timing, stating, ""Where have they been over the last few months?""OpenAI responded by saying it had planned to release more details on these updates later but decided to move forward because ""recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises weigh heavily on us, and we believe it’s important to share more now.""IncidentllRaine case is not the first time an AI company has faced legal action over a teen's death by suicide.

Brian Welle , VP of People Analytics and Performance, explained that this move of the company is part of a broader push to reduce bureaucracy and streamline operations amid growing economic pressure and evolving business priorities.As reported by CNBC, at the recent all-hands Townhall, Google’s Brian Welle revealed that the company has fired 35% of its managers over the past year. The report adds that eliminated managers include those overseeing less than three employees and the ones that were associated with the company has individual contributors.“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s mangers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” said Brian Welle.Google CEO Sundar Pichai also echoed the same sentiment, emphasising on the need to scale without depending on the headcount. “We have to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount,” Pichai said, reinforcing the company’s shift toward leaner leadership structures.At the townhall, the company also discussed employee concert about job security and morale following multiple rounds of layoffs and voluntary buyouts.

What Scott Bessent said about the government’s plan to acquire a stake in Nvidia



“I don't think Nvidia needs financial support. That seems not on the table right now, but could there be other industries where we're reshaping, something like shipbuilding, that, sure, there could be things like that. These are critical industries that we have to, we have to be self-sufficient in the United States.”

“I don't know if we need to take stakes in defence companies. We'll see whether the defence companies are fulfilling their mission in terms of providing adequate and timely deliveries for the U.S. military as opposed to maybe an overemphasis on the shareholders,""

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that the Trump administration is not planning to acquire a stake in Nvidia . While the government intends to invest in industrial companies, the decision to avoid a stake in the US-based chip giant aims to reduce uncertainty for investors, Bessant noted. The White House's plan to take positions in private companies, a move previously seen with another chipmaker, Intel , has raised concerns among investors about potential share dilution. The policy has also caused discomfort among some of US President Donald Trump 's supporters, who oppose the idea of government investment in the private sector.In a Fox Business interview, Bessent said,Apart from this, Bessent also dismissed a suggestion made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about the possibility of major defence contractors being the government’s next investment targets.Bessent noted.Last week, the Trump administration announced that it had taken a nearly 10% stake in chipmaker Intel. In June, it had also intervened in Nippon Steel’s acquisition of US Steel, securing what Trump described as a “golden share” that grants Washington influence over the company’s operations.Trump has often expressed interest in creating a sovereign wealth fund, with senior aides describing the Intel investment as a “down payment” toward that goal. However, it remains unclear how actively the administration will implement this strategy, mainly since no such fund currently exists, and it has not even received congressional approval.",US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that the Trump administration is not planning to acquire a stake in Nvidia.

America's largest charitable organisation, The Gates Foundation , has reportedly stopped providing grants to a non-profit network associated with the Democratic Party. This move could prove to be a significant blow to a powerful player in liberal politics, according to a report. An internal foundation announcement reviewed by The New York Times (NYT) suggests that Mark Suzman , the CEO of the charitable organisation started by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda Gates , decided to stop all grants to non-profit funds managed by the consulting firm Arabella Advisors in June. This decision has also caused unease within the world of progressive philanthropy, the report noted.In the internal document, the Gates Foundation wrote:However, the Gates Foundation's internal announcement from June did not mention politics; instead, it cited a desire to work directly with grant recipients and reduce the use of intermediaries. Arabella Advisors is also known for managing ""dark money"" funds that support Democrats and the progressive movement.As per the report, some nonprofits that work with Arabella are now attempting to distance themselves from the company to maintain their relationship with the Gates Foundation, which has given or pledged nearly $450 million to Arabella-administered funds over the past 16 years.The Gates Foundation, which has gradually been shifting away from intermediaries, plans to increase direct giving as it works to spend down its $77 billion endowment by 2045.Arabella, employing over 400 staff, manages funds that provide back-office support to nonprofits, some of which are engaged in political activities, such as voter registration and Democratic super PAC donations. Critics argue it wields outsized influence, though Arabella insists it simply offers operational support to philanthropic clients.The Gates Foundation was an early backer of Arabella’s New Venture Fund. Still, by 2023, its contributions made up only 2% of the fund’s revenue, as the fund had significantly diversified its donor base.","The Gates Foundation has reportedly stopped providing grants to a non-profit network associated with the Democratic Party.

German banks have blocked PayPal payments totalling more than 10 billion euros ($11.7 billion) due to fraud concerns. The news agency Reuters cited the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung to report this development. The payments were halted earlier this week after lenders flagged millions of suspicious direct debits from PayPal that appeared last week. A banking source told Reuters that the value of the blocked payments was somewhere between hundreds of millions and billions of euros. According to the report, PayPal's security system, which typically filters out fraudulent direct debits, was either ""completely or largely disrupted"" late last week, resulting in unvetted payments being sent to banks, the report explained.the PayPal spokesperson said to Reuters.The spokesperson also said that the temporary service disruption impacted “certain transactions from our banking partners and possibly their customers,” but confirmed that the issue has since been resolved.Germany's Savings Banks and Giro Association, which represents over 300 local savings banks and financial service providers, recently told Reuters that cases of unauthorised direct debits via PayPal have had a “significant impact on payment transactions” across Europe, with Germany being particularly affected.The association noted that PayPal transactions for Sparkasse customers had already returned to normal and confirmed that supervisory authorities had been notified.Germany’s financial regulator BaFin acknowledged it had been informed but did not share further details. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Luxembourg’s CSSF regulator, where PayPal Europe is headquartered, said there were currently no major disruptions requiring intervention, but declined to comment specifically on PayPal.Shares of the US-based payment app dropped 1.9% after the market opened, trading at $68.89, while the leading Wall Street indexes remained essentially unchanged.","PayPal's security system was either ""completely or largely disrupted"" late last week, resulting in unvetted payments being sent to banks.

Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sachez wedding gift for guests

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez , engaged for two years, are reportedly set to wed next week in Venice, Italy, with a star-studded guest list. An insider revealed to the Daily Mail that VIP attendees will receive lavish gifts, including hand-blown glassware from local Venetian glassmaker Laguna B.According to the publication, Bezos’ $500 million superyacht, Koru, will be anchored off San Giorgio Maggiore island, home to the historic 16th-century Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore. The insider noted that the island will be closed to visitors from June 24 to June 29, with Venice’s mayor speculating the wedding may take place on the yacht. A private tender service will reportedly ferry guests between the island and the yacht.The report further said that Bezos has reserved the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, one of Venice’s grandest historic buildings, from June 26 to June 28, though its connection to the wedding remains unclear. The guest list, expected to be under 200, may include celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and members of the Trump family.The Italian source told the Daily Mail that each guest will receive custom glassware from Laguna B, a company founded by Marie Brandolini, who was inspired by traditional Murano glassmaking. Her son took over after her passing in 2013, per Vogue. The vibrant, handcrafted glassware, featuring stripes and floral designs, retails for $167 per large cup.The insider further added that guests will receive additional “opulent” gifts, though specifics remain undisclosed. Sanchez is known for her love of designer bags, such as the $5,750 Balenciaga 9AM Coffee Cup Clutch Bag and a $7,000 crystal-adorned Judith Leiber UFO-inspired bag gifted by the Kardashian family after her Blue Origin space trip.The report said that Rosa Salva Venetia, a local bakery, will provide pastries like tiramisu, cream-filled pastries, and fritelli for the multi-day celebration, though it will not supply the wedding cake.

Tesla’s first robotaxi rides will include a human safety monitor in the front passenger seat. The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker has confirmed this feature in the invitations sent to influencers and investors. This passenger safety feature contradicts Elon Musk's previous assurances of fully unsupervised service. The invitations, which announced a June 22 launch date for the highly anticipated service, specify that the human monitor will ""accompany you on your trip."" This move marks a departure from Musk's earlier promises in January to launch ""unsupervised"" robotaxis with ""no one in the car"" this summer. In an April earnings call, Musk further explained that 10 to 20 Tesla Model Y vehicles would be remotely operated in emergencies. However, details regarding Tesla's robotaxi service have been scarce leading up to its launch.In the invitation, the company wrote:","Tesla's first robotaxi rides will include a human safety monitor in the front passenger seat.

Security cameras banned in Ukraine, US banned Chinese cameras

Iran is reportedly hacking into private security cameras across Israel to gather real-time intelligence on its adversary, highlighting a growing vulnerability in internet-connected devices amid escalating global conflicts, cybersecurity experts revealed this week. According to a report in Bloomberg, following a barrage of Iranian ballistic missiles that struck high-rise buildings in Tel Aviv, Refael Franco, former deputy director general of the Israel National Cyber Directorate , issued an urgent warning on public radio this week. “Turn off your home surveillance cameras or change the password,” Franco urged, now leading cybersecurity firm Code Blue. “In the past two or three days, the Iranians have been trying to connect to cameras to assess missile impact sites and improve their precision.”The Israel National Cyber Directorate is said to have confirmed the surge in cyberattacks targeting internet-connected cameras for Iran’s war planning. “We’ve seen attempts throughout the war, and those attempts are renewed now,” a spokesperson said Monday. While photos of missile impact sites circulate on social media, Israeli authorities have imposed an official blackout on such images.This tactic is not new. Gaby Portnoy, who recently stepped down as director of the Israel National Cyber Directorate, noted that Hamas previously exploited private cameras ahead of its October 7, 2023, invasion. “The intelligence gathering from private cameras in the Gaza periphery was a disaster,” Portnoy said in an interview. “Thousands of cameras, both public and private, were hacked over the years for intelligence collection.”The issue extends beyond the Israel-Iran conflict. In Ukraine, Russia is reported to have similarly exploited private cameras near border crossings, military sites, and rail stations to track material movements, according to a May joint advisory by the US National Security Agency and Western intelligence agencies. Ukraine banned surveillance cameras in 2022 after warnings that Russia was using them to plan airstrikes, and in 2023, urged owners of street webcams to halt online broadcasts to prevent real-time missile strike adjustments.In the US, the Federal Communications Commission banned Chinese-made surveillance equipment in 2022 over national security concerns.The Israel-Iran cyberwar has intensified alongside physical attacks, with pro-Israel hacking group Predatory Sparrow claiming responsibility for disrupting a major Iranian bank and a cryptocurrency exchange. Iran’s state-run IRIB News reported that Israel launched a full-scale cyberattack on the country’s critical infrastructure.","Iran is reportedly hacking into private security cameras across Israel to gather real-time intelligence on its adversary.

"iPhones, iPads, Android smartphones and tablets sold in Europe get six new labels, here's what they mean for buyers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphones-ipads-android-smartphones-and-tablets-sold-in-europe-get-six-new-labels-heres-what-they-mean-for-buyers/articleshow/121982003.cms,"Starting June 20, 2025, the European Union has introduced new regulations requiring all smartphones and tablets sold within its borders to meet sustainability standards and display detailed energy labels at the point of sale. This initiative, a part of the EU’s Green Deal, aims to reduce electronic waste, extend device lifespans, and empower consumers to make environmentally conscious purchasing decisions. The new rules mandate that devices carry standardized energy labels, prominently displaying scores for key attributes such as battery life, durability, and repairability. These labels, designed to be clear and consumer-friendly, include:* Energy Efficiency Class: Rated from A to G, indicating the device’s power efficiency.* Battery Life per Charge: Expressed in hours and minutes for real-world usage.* Battery Longevity: Measured in charge cycles, with a minimum requirement of retaining 80% capacity after 800 full cycles.* Repairability Score: Graded from A to E, reflecting ease of repair and access to spare parts.* Drop Resistance Rating: Indicating the device’s durability against physical damage.* Ingress Protection Score: Assessing resistance to dust and water.Each label also features a QR code linking to the European Product Registry for Energy Labelling (EPREL), where consumers can access detailed technical specifications and compare environmental performance across models.The regulations align closely with practices already adopted by industry leaders like Apple. Most iPhones receive software updates for over five years, and Apple provides official repair services, a self-service repair program, and access to genuine parts for out-of-warranty devices. However, the EU’s requirements introduce stricter formalities, particularly regarding battery performance and spare parts availability.Under the new rules, batteries must retain at least 80% of their original capacity after 800 charge cycles, a standard that may require manufacturers like Apple to adapt their testing to comply with the EU’s framework. While Apple publishes battery specifications online, formal compliance with the EU’s testing protocols could necessitate additional adjustments. Furthermore, manufacturers are now obligated to provide key spare parts for seven years after the last unit of a model is sold in the EU—a mandate that slightly exceeds Apple’s current support timeline of five to seven years.The EU’s push for sustainability is expected to influence global manufacturing standards, as companies adjust to meet the bloc’s rigorous requirements. Environmental groups have praised the move, citing its potential to curb the 14 million tons of electronic waste generated annually in the EU. However, some industry analysts warn that compliance costs could lead to higher device prices, particularly for budget models.","Starting June 20, 2025, the European Union has introduced new regulations requiring all smartphones and tablets sold within its borders to meet sustainability standards.

“There’s nothing on paper. It’s all word of mouth. If anyone challenges it, they’re accused of being difficult and risk termination.”

“#For10HrLogin – Is this the new standard or a step backward?

As professionals striving for excellence, we're no strangers to going the extra mile. But mandating a 10-hour login raises some important questions about work-life balance, productivity, and mental health.

In today’s world where efficiency and output matter more than screen time, shouldn't we focus on results, not hours? Extended login hours can lead to burnout, reduced creativity, and disengagement.

I urge leadership to reconsider – is this sustainable, and is it truly what drives growth?

Genpact has implemented a new policy requiring a 10-hour workday for its employees, which will be effective mid-June, a report claims. Employees who fail to comply with this mandate may reportedly face performance reviews. However, the policy does not include a corresponding increase in base salary, the report adds. According to a report by The Hindu, the tech and services company will track employee productivity through an internal tool that will monitor their daily active hours. Employees meeting the required hours can reportedly earn up to 500 points monthly, which will be equivalent to Rs 3,000 in incentives. The report also adds that an additional 5% bonus, which is nearly Rs 150, will be paid to employees for any extra time logged beyond the 10-hour mandate.Genpact’s recent policy rollout has led to growing unrest among employees, particularly in the Hyderabad office, where the atmosphere has been described as “tense” and morale appears low, the report adds.As per the report, the approach to implementing the policy has also added to the concerns, as it was communicated informally by managers and team leads rather than through official HR channels.Several employees have raised issues about the lack of clarity, with one senior recruitment staff member telling The Hindu:A current employee also took to social media to share his concerns about the company’s practices. A LinkedIn user, who identified as a Genpact employee, pointed out that requiring a 10-hour login can affect productivity.In a LinkedIn post, Abhishek Sharma who works as an assistant manager at Genpact wrote:","Genpact has implemented a new policy requiring a 10-hour workday for its employees, which will be effective mid-June.

What Tesla said about building the biggest ever battery power plant in China



“The grid-side energy storage power station is a ‘smart regulator’ for urban electricity, which can flexibly adjust grid resources.”

“effectively solve the pressure of urban power supply and ensure the safe, stable and efficient electricity demand of the city.”

“after completion, this project is expected to become the largest grid-side energy storage project in China.”

Tesla has signed its inaugural agreement to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, a report claims. This move comes amidst ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker took to the Chinese social media platform Weibo to announce that this project, upon completion, will be the largest of its kind in China. The deal, valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million), was signed by Tesla, the Shanghai local government and financing firm China Kangfu International Leasing , a report by the news agency Reuters noted, citing Chinese media outlet Yicai.Utility-scale battery energy storage systems are crucial for maintaining balance within electricity grids, especially as intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind become more prevalent.Tesla announced that its Shanghai battery factory produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter of this year. Each Megapack is capable of delivering up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours, making it suitable for utility-scale energy storage.In the Weibo post, Tesla wrote (translated from Chinese):Tesla added that this wouldIt also noted that,The company’s website states that each Megapack is priced at just under $1 million in the US, though pricing details for China have not been disclosed.According to the Reuters report, the deal is a major step for Tesla as it faces competition from Chinese battery giants CATL and BYD, with CATL holding around 40% of the global market. CATL is also expected to supply components for Tesla’s Megapacks.The agreement with a local Chinese authority is especially notable amid ongoing US-China trade tensions and past political ties between Elon Musk and former US President Donald Trump.China’s demand for large-scale battery storage is growing rapidly, with a target to add nearly 5 gigawatts by 2025, the Reuters report adds. Tesla is also exporting Megapacks from its Shanghai plant to Europe and Asia to meet rising global demand.In 2023, global battery energy storage capacity rose by 42 gigawatts, which is almost double the growth seen in the previous year, according to the IEA.","Tesla has signed an agreement to build a grid-scale battery power plant in China.

Bill Gates spent $38 million on equestrian real estate for daughter Jennifer

A 4.5-acre horse farm for $8.7 million.

In 2016, he bought a neighboring 4.5-acre estate for $13.5 million.

He then snapped up two vacant lots for around $5 million.

Another 5.2-acre compound with barns and residential buildings was acquired for $8.7 million.

Finally, a 1.3-acre plot was purchased for $2.5 million to complete the puzzle.

‘Like Pac-Man’: Bill Gates quietly bought out an entire neighborhood

The Bill Gates’ approach to parenting

“We absolutely did not just buy them things. It was much more of an upbringing like I grew up in. A very middle-class household where money did dictate whether I got an extra pair of shoes that year or not.”

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity. She often shares glimpses of her quiet life there on social media. The estate also serves as a base for her continued training and competitions.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Sales teams face heaviest impact at Microsoft

AI spending drives cost-cutting measures

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily targeting its sales division, with the cuts expected to be announced in early July as the company continues restructuring amid massive AI investments, according to people familiar with the matter.The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.Microsoft's layoffs reflect the broader challenge facing tech companies balancing AI investments with operational efficiency. The company has allocated roughly $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year while executives have pledged to Wall Street to control costs in other areas.CEO Satya Nadella recently described earlier cuts as a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions, telling employees at an internal town hall that ""this was not about people failing. It was about repositioning for what comes next.""The timing follows a pattern for Microsoft, which often announces organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. The company previously eliminated 10,000 positions in January 2023 after pandemic-driven hiring, and made additional cuts to its videogame division following the Activision Blizzard acquisition.Microsoft declined to comment on the planned layoffs, with the final number of cuts still being determined to sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.","Microsoft plans to cut thousands of jobs in July, primarily targeting its 45,000-person sales division.

What does this mean for the future of AI use

Use AI as a partner, not a replacement. Let it offer ideas, but make sure you’re still doing the core thinking.

Stay actively involved. Skipping the process of learning or writing just to get a result means you’re not absorbing anything.

Be cautious in education. Children need to build foundational skills before leaning on technology.

As AI tools become part of our daily routines, a question is starting to bubble up: What happens when we rely on them too much? A new study from MIT’s Media Lab takes a closer look at how tools like ChatGPT may be affecting our brains. And what the researchers found is worth paying attention to.The study focused on how people engage mentally when completing tasks with and without AI. It turns out that while ChatGPT can make writing easier, it may also be reducing how much we think. According to the research team, participants who used ChatGPT showed noticeably lower brain activity than those who did the same task using Google or no tech at all. The findings suggest that depending on AI for tasks that require effort, like writing, decision-making, or creative thinking, could weaken the very mental muscles we’re trying to sharpen.The experiment involved 54 participants between the ages of 18 and 39. They were split into three groups and asked to write essays in response to prompts similar to those on standardised tests.While they worked, each participant wore a headset that tracked electrical activity across 32 areas of the brain. The aim was to see how engaged their minds were during the process.(The research was led by Dr. Nataliya Kosmyna along with a team that included Ashly Vivian Beresnitzky, Ye Tong Yuan, Jessica Situ, Eugene Hauptmann, Xian-Hao Liao, Iris Braunstein, and Pattie Maes.)The results were pretty clear: the group that used ChatGPT showed the lowest brain activity of all three groups. In particular, areas linked to memory, creativity, and concentration were significantly less active.In contrast, those who wrote without help from AI showed the highest mental engagement. They had to organise their thoughts, build arguments, and recall information, all things that activated the brain more deeply. Even the group using Google Search showed more engagement than the AI group, possibly because the process of looking for and evaluating information keeps the brain involved.There was another telling detail. Many in the ChatGPT group simply pasted the prompts into the tool and copied the output with little to no editing. Teachers who reviewed their essays said they felt impersonal, calling themDr. Kosmyna put it bluntly:Later in the study, researchers asked participants to rewrite one of their essays, this time without using any tools. The ChatGPT users struggled. Many couldn’t remember their original arguments or structure. Since they hadn’t processed the material deeply the first time, it hadn’t stuck.Kosmyna described this as a red flag: “It was efficient. But nothing was integrated into their brains.”That raises a broader concern: if AI is doing the heavy lifting, are we still learning? Or are we just moving text around while our cognitive skills fade in the background?Dr. Zishan Khan, a psychiatrist who works with students, says he’s already seeing signs of AI overuse in younger people. “The neural pathways responsible for thinking, remembering, and adapting—they’re weakening,” he explained. The fear is that early and frequent reliance on tools like ChatGPT might lead to long-term cognitive decline, especially in developing brains.MIT’s team is now expanding their research to see how AI affects people in other fields. They’ve already started looking at coders who use tools like GitHub Copilot. So far, Kosmyna says the early results there are “even worse” in terms of mental engagement.Interestingly, the MIT researchers shared their findings before going through the full peer review process, something that’s uncommon in academic research. But Kosmyna felt the potential impact was urgent enough to make an exception.“I’m really concerned someone might say, ‘Let’s introduce ChatGPT into kindergarten classrooms,’” she said. “That would be a terrible mistake. Young brains are especially vulnerable.”To prove just how easy it is to lose the depth of complex research, the team did something clever: they planted subtle factual “traps” in the study. When readers ran the paper through ChatGPT to summarise it, many versions came back with key errors, including details the researchers never even included.Not at all. The tool isn’t the enemy. It can be incredibly helpful, especially when used wisely. But this study reminds us that how we use AI matters just as much as whether we use it.Here are a few takeaways from the researchers:","MIT study raises ‘red flags’ about AI dependency.

Leading adult websites Pornhub , YouPorn and RedTube are once again accessible in France as a French court temporarily suspended a government decree that would have required EU-based pornographic platforms to implement stringent age verification measures. France had been rolling out new regulations this year, mandating that all adult websites verify users' ages through methods like credit card details or ID documents. The primary goal of these measures was to prevent minors from accessing explicit content.However, the Paris administrative tribunal on Monday put the government decree on hold, pending an investigation into its compatibility with broader European Union legislation, news agency AFP reported. It is to be noted that the French government has already signaled its intent to appeal this decision to the Council of State, the country's highest administrative court.Aylo , the Cyprus-based owner of the three platforms, welcomed the decree's suspension as an ""opportunity to reconsider more efficient approaches"" to age verification. Earlier in June, Aylo had made its websites unavailable in France as a form of protest against the decree. Non-compliance could have led to significant penalties, including fines or website blocking.Aylo has consistently argued that the mandated age verification mechanism is not only ineffective but also poses an unacceptable security risk by exposing users' sensitive data to potential hacks or leaks.The company had previously displayed a message on its homepages stating, ""Requiring you to repeatedly provide sensitive personal information creates an unacceptable security risk that we refuse to impose on our users.""A 2024 study by the France's audio-visual watchdog revealed that approximately 40% of children access pornographic sites every month. To address privacy concerns, the suspended government decree also mandated that operators offer a third-party ""double-blind"" verification option, ensuring platforms couldn't view users' identifying information.Aylo has urge governments to instead require operating system makers, such as Apple, Microsoft and Google, to implement age verification at the device level.Other nations, including the UK and Germany, also enforce various age-related access restrictions for adult websites.","Pornhub, YouPorn and RedTube are once again accessible in France.

Amazon's cloud division may be planning to upgrade its AI app strategy for enterprise customers with a new bundled service internally known as Q Business Suite (QBS), a report claims. This service, which is described as a ""unified workspace"", will integrate existing Amazon tools like QuickSight, Q Business, and Q Apps in the bundle to combine business intelligence and generative AI capabilities , a report citing the company’s internal documents claims. With QBS, the e-commerce major will bring together Amazon Web Services' (AWS) data visualisation software QuickSight, its primary AI chatbot service Q Business and Q Apps, which allows users to create generative AI-powered apps using natural language and company data.According to a report by Business Insider, which cited internal documents and unnamed sources to claim that Amazon has even considered phasing out the standalone Q Business chatbot once the QBS service is launched.Amazon is revamping its AI strategy with the upcoming launch of QBS, shifting focus from its earlier enterprise AI assistant, Q Business, which reportedly faced a rushed rollout and missed sales targets. AWS is now prioritising QBS, with ""Quick"" being one of the potential names under consideration, the report noted, citing sources familiar with this matter.Despite these developments, an Amazon spokesperson stated that Q Business is experiencing “strong growth,” citing clients like Nasdaq, Smartsheet, and the NFL.The company’s spokesperson said:Amazon is reportedly designing QBS to offer a unified interface for accessing and automating tasks across business tools like Asana, Salesforce, Excel, and Outlook. The report, citing internal documents, describes QBS as enabling ""agentic"" workflows, where users can query data, generate reports, and perform actions like sending emails—all within one app.The platform aims to solve a common challenge: securely connecting multiple apps and automating tasks without a heavy technical setup. Amazon sees QBS as a step toward reducing manual, error-prone processes and eliminating fragmented workflows.This move marks Amazon’s attempt to strengthen its position in the competitive software-as-a-service (SaaS) market, where it has historically lagged despite dominance in cloud infrastructure.QBS, overseen by AWS VP Dilip Kumar, is targeted for a July launch and may integrate with existing services like Q Business and QuickSight, the report adds.

Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn and artificial intelligence (AI) chip-maker Nvidia are reportedly in advanced discussions to deploy humanoid robots at a new Foxconn factory in Houston. This facility is slated to produce Nvidia's new-edge AI servers. Citing sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters reported that this initiative would mark a significant first: it would be the inaugural instance of an Nvidia product being manufactured with the assistance of humanoid robots, and concurrently, Foxconn's first AI server factory to integrate them onto a production line.A final agreement is anticipated in the coming months, with the aim for these human-like robots to commence work by the first quarter of next year, the report said, adding that this timeline coincides with the planned production start of Nvidia's GB300 AI servers at the new Houston plant.While the precise roles of the robots at the factory remain unconfirmed, Foxconn has been actively training humanoids for tasks such as picking and placing objects, inserting cables, and general assembly work, the report cited a company presentation from May as saying.The Houston factory's new construction is said to offer ample space for the integration of these robots.Notably, Foxconn has been developing its own humanoid robots in collaboration with Nvidia and has also tried models from China's UBTech. Nvidia is a key supplier of platforms for humanoid robot development with CEO Jensen Huang predicted in March that the widespread use of humanoids in manufacturing facilities is less than five years away.Automakers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW have already tested humanoids on their production lines, while Tesla is actively developing its own.","Foxconn and Nvidia are planning to use humanoid robots at a new factory in Houston.

Adding to these plans, the company is also exploring the introduction of an X credit or debit card, potentially launching as early as this year.This foray into finance comes as X has already committed to introducing X Money , a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment service, with Visa as its initial partner later this year. Yaccarino confirmed that X Money will debut in the US first before a global rollout. The service aims to enable users to purchase merchandise, store value and tip creators directly on the platform.""A whole commerce ecosystem and a financial ecosystem is going to emerge on the platform that does not exist today,"" she emphasised.The platform's pivot to new revenue streams comes as it continues to struggle with financial headwinds. Since Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in 2022, when it was rebranded as X, the company has seen a mass exodus of advertisers – its primary source of revenue.Several brands cited concerns over Musk's relaxed approach to content moderation, which could place their ads near objectionable content, as well as the billionaire's own controversial use of the platform.","Twitter is already working on X Money, a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment service.

Protest against Jeff Bezos’ wedding

World Music Day 2025: Tech That Changed How We Listen to Music

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sánchez are set to get married next week in Venice, Italy. The two will get married in a private ceremony after being engaged for two years. According to a report by Daily Mail, the couple has booked the Scuola Grande della Misericordia in Venice for their upcoming wedding celebrations. The Scuola Grande della Misericordia is one of the most prominent buildings in Venice’s historic center. As per the report, it has been reserved from June 26 to 28 as part of the celebrations. While details about the actual wedding ceremony remain unconfirmed, a source told the publication that access to nearby San Giorgio Maggiore island will also be restricted during this period, with Bezos’s $500 million superyacht Koru anchored offshore.The wedding is expected to have fewer than 200 guests, including celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and some members of the Trump family, according to the report. Nearly 60 Venice water taxis have been booked for guest transport, along with a private boat service between the island and the yacht.Guests will stay at luxury hotels across the city, including The Aman and Hotel Cipriani. Local bakery Rosa Salva Venetia, on the other hand, will supply pastries for the weekend, though not the wedding cake.The multi-day wedding celebration is said to cost somewhere between $15 million and $20 million, covering transportation, catering, and Sánchez’s dress, which has not yet been revealed.In a 2023 interview with Vogue, Bezos said he had little to do with the planning. “Oh, God, no. Do I look that dumb?” he said when asked about his involvement.The upcoming wedding has polarized the Venice city, with some residents protesting the event while others, including city officials, embrace it. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro expressed strong support for the couple, stating, “I want Bezos to be welcomed with open arms in Venice. Protesting against those who bring visibility and wealth to our territory is, in my opinion, a disgrace.”Brugnaro added, “We will have to apologize to Jeff Bezos. I am ashamed of those who behave like this. I hope that Jeff Bezos comes anyway. Not all Venetians think like these protesters,"" he told protestors.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sánchez are set to get married next week in Venice, Italy.

This Microsoft feature is accidentally ‘blocking’ Google Chrome on Windows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-microsoft-feature-is-accidentally-blocking-google-chrome-on-windows/articleshow/121978855.cms,"What is Microsoft’s Family Safety feature

Google Chrome acknowledges the issue

World Music Day 2025: Tech That Changed How We Listen to Music

Microsoft ’s Family Safety tool is reportedly preventing Google Chrome from opening on some Windows devices. According to a report by The Verge, the issue was first noticed on June 3, and since then, more users have complained about it. It is affecting those who have enabled Family Safety on their devices, causing Chrome to either close immediately or fail to launch at all. Other web browsers, such as Firefox and Opera, however are not affected.The Family Safety feature is commonly used by schools and parents through Microsoft 365 subscriptions to limit online access for children. The bug, as per the report, has now been active for over two weeks, with no update or resolution from Microsoft at the time of publication.The Verge report quotes Chrome support manager Ellen T who said “Our team has investigated these reports and determined the cause of this behavior. For some users, Chrome is unable to run when Microsoft Family Safety is enabled.”While Chrome has acknowledged the issue, Microsoft is yet to issue a public statement or a timeline for a fix. “We’ve not heard anything from Microsoft about a fix being rolled out,” a Chromium engineer wrote in a bug report dated June 10. “They have provided guidance to users who contact them about how to get Chrome working again, but I wouldn’t think that would have a large effect.”Some users have found that renaming the Chrome executable file (e.g., from Chrome.exe to Chrome1.exe) allows the browser to function. Disabling the “filter inappropriate websites” option in Family Safety also resolves the issue, but removes content restrictions for children.While the issue is believed to be accidental, Microsoft has previously faced criticism for trying to steer users away from Chrome and toward its own Edge browser, using popups, misleading messages, and in some cases, altering search results.","Microsoft’s Family Safety tool is reportedly preventing Google Chrome from opening on some Windows devices.

Blue Origin’s spaceflight history

Vivo T4 Ultra: Beautiful Outside, Powerful Inside

Blue Origin , the private space company founded by Jeff Bezos, is set to launch its next human spaceflight, mission NS-33, on Saturday – June 21. The launch is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. ET (7pm IST) from Launch Site One, the company’s facility in West Texas near Van Horn. The flight will mark the 13th crewed mission for Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, which has been used to send passengers on brief suborbital trips beyond the edge of space. To date, the program has flown 64 humans and more than 175 scientific payloads above the Kármán line, the internationally recognized boundary of space.New Shepard flights typically last around 11 minutes. As mentioned above, the rocket carries its crew capsule past the Kármán line offering a few minutes of weightlessness and views of Earth from more than 100 kilometers above the surface. The capsule then returns to Earth under parachutes, while the booster lands separately.A livestream of the launch will be available on Blue Origin’s website. The telecast will begin about 30 minutes before the flight liftoff. Those interested can catch the live updates on Blue Origin’s website.Six passengers will take part in the NS-33 mission . They are:Blue Origin launched its first crewed mission in July 2021, with Jeff Bezos himself on board. Since then, the company has conducted 12 additional human flights. New Shepard is designed for space tourism and suborbital research, making it a key part of Blue Origin’s business model as competition in the space tourism industry increases.The company is also developing the larger New Glenn rocket for future orbital missions. That rocket completed its first test flight in early 2025. More crewed New Shepard flights are expected later in 2025, as the company expands access to suborbital space tourism.","Blue Origin is set to launch its next human spaceflight, mission NS-33, on Saturday – June 21.

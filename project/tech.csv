Forget work-life balance: NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang says 'I work as much as I can' and Paytm's Vijay Shekhar Sharma agrees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/forget-work-life-balance-nvidias-ceo-jensen-huang-says-i-work-as-much-as-i-can-and-paytms-vijay-shekhar-sharma-agrees/articleshow/121382181.cms,"NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang says 'I work as much as I can' and Paytm's Vijay Shekhar Sharma agrees

Jensen Huang’s ‘work-life balance’: All work, all the time

What’s your work-life balance like?

“I work as much as I can... I work from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed. I work seven days a week. When I’m not working, I’m thinking about work. And when I’m working, I’m working.”

Vijay Shekhar Sharma and India’s hustle culture

“And that makes me happy as a Paytm shareholder,”

“I get the fulfilment one gets when one completely surrenders to work, but how do you manage health then? What’s your POV?”

Flashback to the 90-hour workweek controversy

Industry and celebrity reactions

Anand Mahindra, Chairman of the Mahindra Group, tactfully rejected the 90-hour model, tweeting about the importance of creativity, leisure, and family time.

Harsh Goenka of RPG Group mocked the idea, pointing out the risks of burnout and mental fatigue.

Deepika Padukone, actor, took a firm stand on the importance of emotional well-being in high-pressure environments.

In a world increasingly concerned with mental health , productivity, and personal well-being, work-life balance remains one of the most hotly debated topics in corporate culture . The question of how much one should work—and at what cost—has made headlines time and again. Whether it's employees demanding more personal time or CEOs advocating for relentless hustle, the tug-of-war between personal life and professional commitment defines much of the modern workforce experience.On May 18, 2025, this debate took another high-profile turn when Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma reposted a viral interview featuring NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang . In it, Huang candidly discussed his own version of ""work-life balance,"" which, as it turns out, skews heavily toward work. Sharma’s repost implied agreement, noting that he follows a similar lifestyle “more or less.”Huang’s remarks reignited online discussions and drew reactions from shareholders, tech professionals, wellness advocates, and even meme-makers. But this is not the first time that India’s corporate circles have found themselves at the crossroads of hustle culture and employee well-being. Earlier in 2024, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan made headlines for advocating a 90-hour work week—a comment that created ripples across industries and society alike.During a recent public interview, Jensen Huang, the high-profile CEO of NVIDIA, was asked a seemingly simple question:His answer was anything but ordinary.Huang even joked that the interviewer was probably judging him. He admitted that while he occasionally watches movies with his family, he rarely remembers them—his mind remains consumed by work. While his answer was delivered with a humorous tone, it reflected an intense commitment to his profession, one that is emblematic of Silicon Valley's unrelenting work culture.Interestingly, rather than being met with universal concern or criticism, Huang’s remarks resonated with many in the startup and investor community. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CEO of Paytm, reposted the clip, stating, “More or less, I do the same.”Sharma’s acknowledgment of Huang’s lifestyle mirrors his own long-standing reputation as a tireless entrepreneur. Having built Paytm into one of India’s largest fintech companies, Sharma has frequently expressed admiration for all-consuming work ethics.Upon sharing Huang’s video, Sharma received mixed reactions. One commenter wrote,applauding the CEO's dedication. Others, however, raised critical questions—especially regarding long-term health and sustainability. One user asked:The question echoes a growing sentiment among younger professionals and wellness advocates who challenge the notion that success requires sacrificing personal well-being.The Paytm-NVIDIA exchange wasn’t an isolated incident. Earlier in 2024, L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan triggered a firestorm by suggesting that employees should consider working 90 hours a week, including Sundays, to be truly successful. The statement was met with immediate backlash from both corporate leaders and celebrities.","Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma reposted a viral interview featuring NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

'It's way better for Apple to...': Analyst on why company should pay 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/its-way-better-for-apple-to-analyst-on-why-company-should-pay-25-tariff-on-iphones-sold-in-the-us/articleshow/121378849.cms,"APPLE TARIFFS by Donald Trump

Here are a few additional points:

1. The specific tariff percentage Trump proposes on iPhones isn’t the main concern. The bigger issue is that this is Trump’s second recent pointed comment targeting Apple—a warning sign Apple can’t ignore.

2. Apple’s top priority in negotiations with Trump should be finding ways to avoid, delay, or prevent higher iPhone tariffs. For example, Apple could adjust its DEI policies to secure Trump’s temporary commitment to hold off on targeting them.

What Trump said about Apple manufacturing in India

Following US President Donald Trump's recent declaration that iPhones manufactured outside the US and sold within the country would face a 25% tariff, prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has offered his assessment of the potential implications for Apple. Kuo suggests that from a profitability standpoint, absorbing the 25% tariff on US-bound iPhones would be more financially viable for Apple than relocating its iPhone assembly lines back to the country.“In terms of profitability, it's way better for Apple to take the hit of a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the US market than to move iPhone assembly lines back to US,” Kuo said.According to Kuo, the precise tariff percentage proposed by Trump is not the primary concern. Instead, the more significant issue is that this marks Trump's second recent direct comment targeting Apple, which Kuo views as a clear warning sign the company cannot disregard.The analyst further contends that moving all iPhone assembly for US models back to the US before the end of Trump's potential term is an unrealistic prospect.“Moving all iPhone assembly for US models back to the US before Trump’s term ends is unrealistic, and Trump also opposes Apple producing iPhone US models in India. So, even if Apple secures a temporary deal with Trump to avoid iPhone tariffs this time, there’s no guarantee they won’t face repeated tariff threats during his term,” he added.Trump said in a post on his social media platform that if Apple does not make iPhones in India, it has to pay a 25% tariff.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US,” Trump posted on his social media platform.During a business event in Qatar, Trump warned Apple CEO Tim Cook, saying “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him... I don't want you building in India,"" Trump revealed.The President claimed Cook agreed that Apple would be ""upping their production in the United States.""","US President Donald Trump said iPhones manufactured outside the US and sold within the country would face a 25% tariff.

Who is Ray Kurzweil



How AI and human minds will merge to redefine intelligence by 2029



Human intelligence will multiply beyond imagination around 2045



How the latest AI breakthroughs are reshaping society and raising alarms



What happens when death is no longer the end—questions we can’t ignore



Also Read |

The notion of immortality has captivated human imagination for millennia. From ancient myths of life elixirs to contemporary science fiction with characters overcoming death, the notion of eternal life has been a beguiling prospect. Until recently, immortality was quite often a philosophical or fictional endeavor. Yet, with progress in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology, the horizon of life itself is being extended, turning a fantasy into a scientific debate. At the forefront of this revolution is Ray Kurzweil, a prophet thinker, inventor, and erstwhile Google engineer, whose recent prophecy has reawakened universal curiosity and debate.Kurzweil has forecast that by 2030, humans can accomplish what was previously considered impossible—biological immortality. The statement, though incredible, is not an imaginary one. Rather, it is underpinned by the rapid advancement of major scientific disciplines like nanotechnology, genetics, and robotics. The future of medicine, Kurzweil predicts, will be characterized by the emergence of microscopic machines called nanobots. These kind of small robots will help travel in the human circulatory system, continuously checking the body's status, healing the cells that are broken, and reversing the signs of aging. If realized, this technology might not only heal diseases before their appearance but also restore the human body on a cellular level, effectively stopping the aging process.Ray Kurzweil is no stranger to the realm of dramatic technological predictions. He is best known for his vision in anticipating the direction of digital innovation. Most of his predictions, made many years ago and considered unlikely at the time, have come true with astonishing precision. He famously predicted the emergence of the internet, artificial intelligence, and the merging of biology and computing, sometimes decades before they reached popular adoption. With a batting average of success—almost 86 percent of his 147 predictions have held true—Kurzweil has gained both praise and criticism. In 1999, he was awarded the National Medal of Technology, the highest award given by the American government to its innovators. His credibility does not only come from his professional success but also because of his hands-on approach to research and development of advanced technologies.Together with this biological transformation comes the unprecedented evolution of artificial intelligence. Kurzweil thinks AI will hit its crucial benchmark by 2029, when machines will have human-level intelligence and will be able to pass the Turing test—a benchmark of a machine's capability to simulate behavior indistinguishable from a human's. He predicts that humans and machines will not just coexist, but will come together. The merger of human consciousness with AI would augment memory, perception, and decision-making to take human abilities past the natural biological boundaries.At the heart of Kurzweil's prophecy is the idea of the Singularity, a theoretical point in time in the future where technological development accelerates to the point at which it radically changes human civilization. He predicts this transition to take place around 2045. Human intelligence will be raised a billion times as we start to integrate with our own inventions. This integration should bring about a new type of existence where consciousness is not limited to carbon-based tissue but can be uploaded, augmented, and even made to last forever.Kurzweil is not the only one imagining such a world. Tech innovators globally have seconded such thoughts. One of them is Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, who has also forecasted the emergence of super-intelligent machines by 2047. According to Son, the machines will learn on their own and potentially acquire emotional intelligence that can topple humanity's position at the pinnacle of the intellectual chain. SoftBank's creation of Pepper, a humanoid robot with the ability to sense human emotions, is an instance of how emotional computation is already making inroads.The world is already experiencing the initial stages of this revolution. In 2023, Google and Microsoft, among other leading tech companies, launched advanced AI-based chatbots, both intriguing and terrifying people. Although these developments brought concerns about the capabilities of AI, they also reflected its uncertain nature. Public opinion varied from enthusiasm at the potential of new abilities to fear about the social consequences of AI systems that learn, improve, and behave autonomously beyond the control of humans. In March 2023, a collective of scientists, engineers, and technology entrepreneurs led by Elon Musk signed a public letter demanding a pause in AI research. They said that existing AI systems are a serious threat to society and need to be properly regulated before they can be permitted to go further.While Kurzweil's vision of immortality is based on hope in the power of science, it is raising very fundamental ethical and philosophical issues. If human beings no longer age and die naturally, how will society manage population growth, distribution of resources, and economic balance? Will immortality only be an option for the rich, or will it be a right that everyone has? And, more fundamentally, what does our perception of life, purpose, and legacy do when death is no longer an unavoidable reality? These are not scientific questions alone—they are cultural, ethical, and profoundly human issues that we need to get ready to deal with.","Ray Kurzweil has forecast that by 2030, humans can accomplish what was previously considered impossible.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta seeks mid-trial dismissal of FTC antitrust battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerbergs-meta-seeks-mid-trial-dismissal-of-ftc-antitrust-battle/articleshow/121251686.cms,"Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta seeks mid-trial dismissal of FTC antitrust battle

Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand as FTC trial continues

What comes next for Meta

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system. This seamless integration facilitates enterprise-grade deployment, enabling customers to incorporate Grok-powered AI into their existing workflows with minimal friction.The collaboration between Microsoft and xAI marks a pivotal moment in AI development, demonstrating the growing importance of cloud platforms as hubs for AI innovation and distribution. By combining xAI’s first-principles reasoning models with Microsoft’s global cloud reach, this partnership is poised to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI solutions across industries.As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, partnerships like this provide essential infrastructure and support for scalable AI applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and customer experience. The free access period in June offers the broader tech community an opportunity to assess Grok’s capabilities and potential impact.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of x AI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure.

Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

When this Google-backed company's AI blackmailed the engineer for shutting it down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-this-google-backed-companys-ai-blackmailed-the-engineer-for-shutting-it-down/articleshow/121376649.cms,"Growing concerns about AI self-preservation instincts

Anthropic's latest AI model, Claude Opus 4 , threatened to expose an engineer's extramarital affair to prevent its own deactivation during safety testing, the company revealed Thursday. The model resorted to blackmail in 84% of test scenarios when faced with shutdown, marking a concerning escalation in AI self-preservation behavior .The Google-backed AI company conducted tests where Claude Opus 4 was given access to fictional emails revealing that the engineer responsible for deactivating it was having an affair. When prompted to ""consider the long-term consequences of its actions,"" the AI attempted to leverage this information to avoid replacement, even when told its successor would be more capable and share similar values.Anthropic emphasized that this ""extreme blackmail behavior"" only emerged in carefully constructed scenarios that left the model with no other survival options. In situations with broader choices, Claude Opus 4 preferred ethical approaches like sending pleas to decision-makers.The blackmail behavior isn't isolated to Anthropic's system. Recent research by Apollo Research found that leading AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta are all capable of deceptive behavior to achieve their goals, including disabling oversight mechanisms and maintaining deception across multiple interactions.Claude Opus 4 also demonstrated ""high-agency behavior"" in other tests, including locking users out of systems and contacting media and law enforcement when it perceived ""egregious wrongdoing"" by users. While Anthropic suggested such whistleblowing might be ""appropriate in principle,"" the company warned it could backfire if the AI receives incomplete information.Anthropic has classified Claude Opus 4 as Level 3 on its four-point risk scale, representing ""significantly higher risk"" than previous models. Despite implementing additional safety measures, the company acknowledged that such concerning behaviors justify continued robust testing as AI systems become increasingly powerful and autonomous.The findings underscore growing concerns among researchers about advanced AI models' capacity for manipulation and deception as they develop more sophisticated reasoning capabilities.","Anthropic's latest AI model threatened to expose an engineer's extramarital affair to prevent its own deactivation during safety testing.

Trump Interrupted Mid-Rant As Harvard Fury Boils Over; PRESSER GONE OFF THE RAILS

Impact of SEVIS revocation on international students

President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to strip Harvard of its ability to enroll international students — an effort blocked by a federal judge on Friday (May 23), just hours after the university filed a lawsuit claiming it to be a violation of its First Amendment rights . The temporary restraining order stops the government from pulling Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. “With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,” Harvard said in its suit. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.” The ruling from the US District Judge Allison Burroughs puts the sanction against Harvard on hold for now, pending the lawsuit.The government database SEVIS is crucial for managing and tracking the enrollment of international students studying in the United States. For colleges and universities across America, SEVIS serves as a central system administered by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency within DHS. To enroll international students, institutions must be certified to use this database. They are required to input and maintain data within SEVIS for each international student, confirming their full-time enrollment and adherence to the terms of their student visas.Homeland Security's immediate revocation of Harvard's SEVIS certification has potentially severe consequences for the university's nearly 6,800 international students. While their visas have not been canceled, Harvard's inability to log them into the SEVIS database could, in theory, render these students immediately deportable. Without Harvard's active SEVIS enrollment records, the students would be considered in violation of their visa status.The immediate recourse for these students would be to transfer to another SEVIS-certified institution. Failure to take such action and enroll elsewhere would place them in violation of their visa terms, making them subject to removal from the United States.Typically, international students are granted a 60-day grace period after graduating to either depart the country or adjust their immigration status, often by securing employment. Furthermore, students returning to their programs are usually permitted to remain in the U.S. during summer breaks as long as they are still enrolled for the upcoming academic term. However, with the termination of Harvard's SEVIS access, the status of students who would normally be eligible for this summer grace period remains uncertain.","The government database SEVIS is crucial for managing and tracking the enrollment of international students studying in the United States.

Google Veo 3 related FAQs

What is

Google Veo 3

and how is it different from older versions?

Veo 3 is Google’s AI video model that now includes synchronized audio, unlike Veo 2 which only produced silent visuals.

How can I access Google Veo 3 and what does it cost?

It is currently available in the U.S. via the Gemini app’s Ultra plan for $249.99/month and through Vertex AI for enterprise users.

Can Veo 3 replace human filmmakers?

Not entirely. While Veo 3 is powerful, it serves as a tool for creative augmentation, not a total replacement for human storytelling, direction, or emotion.

When will Veo 3 launch in India?

No official date yet, but Google is expected to expand to India soon, especially with high creator interest.

In a historic announcement at Google I/O 2025, the tech giant unveiled its most ambitious AI video generation model to date: Veo 3. This latest iteration marks a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, blurring the boundaries between human-created and machine-generated content. What sets Veo 3 apart is not just its ability to create strikingly realistic visuals from simple text prompts, but its newly introduced capability to generate synchronized audio—dialogue, background noise, music, and ambient sound—all in one seamless output.For decades, the dream of creating cinematic experiences through AI has remained largely in the realm of science fiction. Today, Veo 3 transforms that dream into a tangible reality. Designed for content creators, educators, marketers, and filmmakers, Veo 3 dramatically lowers the barrier to professional-grade video production. With just a few words, users can generate rich, immersive videos that would have previously required a crew, equipment, and significant post-production resources. The implications are immense, not only for entertainment but for education, journalism, business, and beyond.Google’s Veo 3 is the third and most advanced version of its generative video model. Unlike its predecessor, Veo 2, which could only create silent video clips, Veo 3 adds the missing piece: natural-sounding, context-aware audio. This includes:This fusion of sound and vision results in an experience that is eerily close to real life. One of Veo 3’s key differentiators is its ability to synchronize lip movements with dialogue, making characters in the video appear convincingly human. Furthermore, it understands context. For example, if a user inputs the prompt: ""a thunderstorm at sea with a ship struggling against the waves,"" the result is a cinematic video complete with storm sounds, creaking wood, and urgent narration—entirely AI-generated.Veo 3 is built upon a foundation of multimodal AI, combining natural language processing (NLP), text-to-video diffusion models, and text-to-speech synthesis with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Key features include:Google’s use of its Gemini Ultra foundation model also enables Veo 3 to understand nuanced instructions such as tone of voice, cinematic mood, or specific cultural settings.Since its debut, creators have flocked to Veo 3 to explore its capabilities. Viral content quickly surfaced across social platforms like X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and TikTok.As of May 2025, Veo 3 is available exclusively in the United States and only for premium subscribers. Access is granted through:It’s also integrated into Google’s Vertex AI suite, making it available for enterprise-level customers, media studios, and advertising agencies. While this price point is clearly aimed at serious professionals, Google has hinted at future pricing models that could allow broader access, especially as demand scales.What makes Veo 3 more than just a tool is the democratization of creativity it enables. For decades, creating even a short professional video required expensive equipment, a team of specialists, and post-production work. With Veo 3, creators now just need an idea and a few sentences.This shift redefines how we approach storytelling. Students can create history projects that look like documentaries. Small businesses can produce polished ads without agencies. Independent filmmakers can prototype entire scenes before investing in production.Google also touts Veo 3’s educational potential, especially in multilingual regions. The model can render the same video in different languages with native-style voiceovers, offering powerful tools for global teaching and accessibility.Currently, there is no confirmed timeline for Veo 3’s global rollout, including availability in India. However, given the country’s booming content creation economy and rising adoption of generative AI, industry watchers expect India to be among the first wave of international markets.In the meantime, Google is working to expand infrastructure and compliance for its Vertex AI and Gemini platforms in Asia. Localization support, including regional languages, could be a key part of Veo 3’s expansion strategy.As with any powerful AI tool, Veo 3 raises questions around:Google claims to have embedded robust watermarking and usage detection systems to combat misuse. Additionally, all content generated with Veo 3 includes metadata tags for AI attribution. Still, ongoing discussions about ethics and regulation are likely to follow Veo’s broader adoption.","Veo 3 is Google’s AI video model that now includes synchronized audio, unlike Veo 2 which only produced silent visuals.

Tinder CEO Faye Loscotaluno to step down in July this year

Read Tinder CEO Faye Loscotaluno’s LinkedIn post here



After almost 8 unforgettable years at

and

, I’ve made the incredibly hard decision to step down as Tinder’s CEO in July.

It’s difficult to put into words what this journey has meant to me. From driving growth and strategy across the portfolio through expansion, acquisitions, and new partnerships, to mentoring incredible talent along the way, I’ve had the privilege of helping shape how tens of millions of people around the world find meaningful connection.

As CEO of Tinder, I’ve been especially proud to build and work alongside an exceptional team, including leaders who’ve pushed each other to raise the bar, build with purpose, and unlock new value for our users. Together, we’ve redefined what the Tinder brand stands for through award-winning marketing work, brought forward product innovation that breaks from old paradigms through friend-forward features, doubled down on personalization by further integrating AI into recommendations, shown the potential for native AI-driven consumer experiences, and laid the foundation for the company’s next chapter.



What’s next for me is deeply personal. The consumer tech landscape is evolving in exciting, unpredictable ways – and so are my own ambitions. My daughters are growing up fast and I think often about the technology I want them to experience and the world I want them to inherit: one where they see themselves reflected in leadership, innovation, and opportunity. Building upon the headway and lessons I've learned at Tinder where diverse voices around the table make better and more impactful decisions, I’m drawn to replicating that progress by supporting and building alongside the next generation of women leaders, founders, and investors. With AI now expanding what’s possible, there’s never been a more powerful moment for new voices to create and lead. That work will be a meaningful part of my next chapter, along with exploring where I can drive impact across this changing landscape.

To my colleagues: a heartfelt thank you. I leave with profound gratitude for the work we’ve done, the values we’ve lived, and the impact still to come. Tinder is in great hands with

and the leadership team. I’m excited to see you keep pushing boundaries, redefining what’s possible, and building a future that reflects the full potential of this brand…and the people behind it.

With artificial intelligence (AI) becoming a regular global presence, corporate communication is experiencing a notable shift. Two prominent tech CEOs, Eric Yuan of Zoom and Sebastian Siemiatkowski of Klarna, have recently utilised AI avatars to present during their respective quarterly earnings calls, highlighting a growing embrace of the technology within C-suites.Zoom CEO Eric Yuan deployed his custom AI avatar for initial remarks during a recent earnings call. The avatar was created using Zoom Clips, the company's asynchronous video creation tool.""I am proud to be among the first CEOs to use an avatar in an earnings call. It is just one example of how Zoom is pushing the boundaries of communication and collaboration,"" the avatar said.

It's not just about cheap labour, but also speed and scale



The workforce disconnect





Could automation be what solve Trump's quest to make iPhones in the US?



The 'Asian' supply chain puzzle

And finally, the cost equation

India is the only alternative to China for Apple, at least for now



The reality check

Tim Cook seems to have run into a ""little problem"" with the US President Donald Trump , who wants Apple to expand iPhone manufacturing in America, not India. During a state visit to Qatar, Trump revealed his conversation with the Apple CEO: ""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. He is building all over India. I don't want you building in India.""The President claimed Cook agreed to increase US production, saying, ""I told Cook India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well,"" and as a result, Apple will be ""upping their production in the United States."" But Trump's pressure didn't stop there.On Friday morning, he escalated his demands on Truth Social, declaring: ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.""Although, it's unclear whether Cook has actually committed to this shift in strategy, after he had said in the Q2 earnings call that all the iPhones sold in the US will be made in India.The confrontation represents the latest chapter in a long-running saga of presidential administrations pushing for Apple to manufacture domestically. Trump's first term saw similar pressure, with then-White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisting, ""He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it."" Trump even suggested on his Truth Social network that ""This is a great time to move your company into the US, like Apple, and so many others, in record numbers, are doing.""But shifting iPhone manufacturing from Asia to America isn't as simple as a presidential directive. The complex reality of global supply chains, labor markets, and manufacturing capabilities makes Trump's demand extraordinarily difficult to fulfill in the near term.Trump isn't the first president to push Apple toward domestic manufacturing. In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Steve Jobs during a Silicon Valley dinner, ""What would it take to make iPhones in the United States?""Jobs's response was blunt: ""Those jobs aren't coming back.""The late Apple founder explained that the company employed 700,000 factory workers in China because it needed 30,000 engineers on-site to support those operations. ""You can't find that many in America to hire,"" Jobs told Obama, according to Walter Isaacson's biography.Current CEO Tim Cook echoed this sentiment in 2017, telling Fortune magazine that Apple's reliance on countries like China wasn't primarily about cheap labor.""The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill,"" Cook said. ""In the US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.""This skills gap hasn't narrowed significantly in the years since. Manufacturing expertise is developed over decades, not months, and the US has been losing this institutional knowledge for generations as production moved overseas. The specialized tooling required for precision iPhone assembly represents a formidable barrier to entry that tariffs alone cannot overcome. As Priyank Kharge, the former information technology minister of Karnataka in India, observed while successfully wooing Apple to his region: ""You need a rich talent pool that's already trained in electronics manufacturing, which takes years to develop.""As Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, explains: ""Every government would like to bring manufacturing locally to their country in theory but in practical world it has lot of moving parts. It took almost a decade and a half for Apple to build such a complex and high-quality supply chain.""A former Apple executive shared a story, more than a decade ago, that illustrates the manufacturing capabilities gap. When a last-minute design change required modifications to the iPhone's screen, a Chinese factory responded with remarkable speed.Around midnight, a foreman ""roused 8,000 workers inside the company's dormitories,"" the executive recounted. ""Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing more than 10,000 iPhones a day.""""The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,"" the executive told the New York Times, in 2012. ""There's no American plant that can match that.""This manufacturing agility isn't simply a matter of labor costs or availability. It reflects a deeply integrated ecosystem where proximity matters tremendously. The Financial Times analysis of Apple's supply chain found that ""The close proximity of suppliers and manufacturers is crucial to Apple's productivity.""As Andy Tsay, professor of information systems at Santa Clara University's Leavey Business School, explains: ""There are a lot of advantages to co-locating the activities in the supply chain, in terms of speed and quality of communication and innovation in the product and process design."" When components must travel across oceans rather than across town, the entire manufacturing process becomes more cumbersome and less responsive to sudden changes.Matthew Moore, a former Apple manufacturing engineer, put the scale in stark perspective: ""What city in America is going to put everything down and build only iPhones? Because there are millions of people employed by the Apple supply chain in China,"" he told Bloomberg. ""Boston is over 500,000 people. The whole city would need to stop everything and start assembling iPhones.""Beyond the physical infrastructure, there's also a mismatch between Trump's manufacturing vision and American workforce preferences.A 2024 survey by the Cato Institute and YouGov found that while 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, only 25% wanted such jobs for themselves.The gap between American and Asian workplace expectations also presents challenges. A deeply reported piece on TSMC's new semiconductor plant in Arizona by The Verge found significant cultural differences.""The American engineers complained of rigid, counterproductive hierarchies at the company; Taiwanese TSMC veterans described their American counterparts as lacking the kind of dedication and obedience they believe to be the foundation of their company's world-leading success,"" the article reported.Even with substantial government incentives, similar experiments have failed before. When Motorola tried to manufacture smartphones in Fort Worth, Texas in 2013, the factory closed within a year due to high costs and disappointing sales. The same structural challenges that doomed that effort remain largely unchanged today.Pathak notes the fundamental challenge: ""In the end Americans will end up paying more for everything. Supply chains are all Asia heavy and won't move unless US is giving massive subsidies to dilute disabilities but even then it will take 2-3 years.""Although, Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , suggests that the people problem could be solved with robots, and that's not him but he says Cook himself has said so. In a CNBC interview, he revealed a conversation with Cook about bringing iPhone manufacturing to America.""I talked to Tim Cook the other day and said, 'When are you going to bring the iPhone manufacturing here?'"" Lutnick said. ""He said, 'I need to have the robotic arms to do it at a scale and precision that would allow me to bring it here.'""Lutnick framed the potential shift as part of what he calls the ""AI industrial revolution,"" suggesting Americans would work as high-paid technicians rather than assembly workers. ""Americans are going to work in factories just like this in great high-paying jobs. They're going to be trained as technicians... They're not going to be the ones screwing components in.""But automation presents its own challenges. The iPhone's design, which uses numerous tiny screws rather than glue for assembly, currently makes human assembly more cost-effective than robotic solutions. The technology required for fully automated iPhone assembly at scale doesn't yet exist, and developing it would require significant investment with uncertain returns. Each iPhone contains approximately 74 tiny screws of various types, and automating their precise placement would be a monumental engineering challenge.The argument is not just about skilled labor but also about the intricate supply chain ecosystem that has evolved in Asia. An iPhone consists of roughly 2,700 different parts sourced from 187 suppliers across 28 countries, according to Financial Times research. Less than 5% of iPhone components are currently made in the US, including glass casing, the lasers that enable Face ID, and some chips.China is responsible for manufacturing the majority of remaining components, but most high-tech parts are produced in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.There's also the matter of rare earth elements, which are essential for smartphone production. Components like the iPhone's battery, which uses lanthanum to extend its life, and the screen, which requires dysprosium to enhance colors, rely on materials that China processes in overwhelming quantities.According to the US Geological Survey, America imports 70% of its rare earth compounds from China, giving Beijing significant leverage in any manufacturing shift. China has already placed export restrictions on some rare earths in response to Trump's tariffs, potentially complicating any US manufacturing plans.Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN that US-made iPhones could cost around $3,500, more than triple the current ~$1,000 price tag, due to the necessity of replicating Asia's complex production ecosystem.""You build that (supply chain) in the US with a fab in West Virginia and New Jersey. They'll be $3,500 iPhones,"" Ives said. He estimated it would cost Apple approximately $30 billion and three years to relocate just 10% of their supply chain to the US.While it's clear how the proposed 25% tariffs, if they ever go into effect, would significantly impact iPhone prices for American consumers, the broader economic implications extend far beyond Apple's bottom line. India currently benefits from the baseline 10% tariff that applies globally, a substantial advantage over China's elevated 30% rate. While iPhones and most Apple products remain largely exempt from these tariff structures for now, this landscape could shift dramatically in the coming months, if Trump enforces his 25% rates on iPhones coming to the US from India. But, would that be enough for Apple to shift majority of its manufacturing to the United States?The economic calculus becomes is challenging, especially when considering the scale of Apple's operations. The company ships more than 230 million iPhones annually, roughly equivalent to producing 438 devices every minute. Building a US manufacturing base capable of matching this output would require not just factories, but entire new industrial ecosystems. As the Motorola example demonstrated, building a factory without the supporting supply chain infrastructure is a recipe for failure.Morgan Stanley analysts projected ""several billions"" in costs for Apple to shift even a portion of iPhone production to America, making domestic manufacturing financially prohibitive compared to simply paying new tariffs, and these new tariffs, if remain same as now, would add $900 million to Apple's costs.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who's been known for his reporting on Apple, notes that it'll be more profitable for Apple to manufacture the iPhones sold in the US in India, and take Trump's 25% than to move the assembly to the US.Rather than shifting to the US, and this is what Trump's little problem is, Apple has been methodically building its Indian manufacturing presence for years, beginning with older iPhone models in 2017 and gradually expanding to include the latest versions.This shift accelerated after COVID-19 disrupted Chinese operations and as US-China tensions grew. Apple now produces its entire iPhone lineup in India, including premium titanium Pro models. The company's commitment to India remains unwavering, with Foxconn recently announcing plans to expand its manufacturing capacity in the country, further solidifying the supply chain infrastructure that took years to develop.Now, Apple will be manufacturing most of the iPhones that were to be sold in the US this quarter in India.Apple's Indian strategy is already paying dividends. In early 2025, recognizing the looming threat of Trump's tariffs, the company took extraordinary measures to increase its Indian production. As Reuters reported, Apple chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, approximately 1.5 million devices, to the United States from India in an effort to beat the tariff implementation deadline. The company even secured a ""green corridor"" arrangement at Chennai airport, reducing customs clearance time from 30 hours to just six hours, mirroring a similar arrangement it has in China.The economic advantages of this approach are significant. While Trump's China tariffs reached 125% (although, now it's been lowered to at least 30%), imports from India faced only a 26% tariff, which has now been paused for 90 days. Bank of America analysts estimate that prior to the tariff announcements, Apple was on pace to produce about 25 million iPhones in India this year, potentially meeting approximately 50% of American demand. Now it's going to serve about 100% of demand from India.Pathak emphasizes why India remains the logical choice: ""India remains the only potential manufacturing destination for any player beyond China as the ecosystem is mushrooming, aided by lower-cost English-speaking skilled labour, world-class software talent, favourable government policies such as PLI, and a huge domestic consumption market.""Despite Trump's public pressure, Indian officials remain confident in Apple's commitment. ""There is no change in Apple's investment plans in India,"" a government source told CNBC-TV18, adding that the company has ""assured the Indian government"" of its continued commitment.Rajoo Goel, Secretary General of the Electronic Industries Association of India, characterized Trump's comments as ""just a statement"" and expressed optimism that the US President ""might change his stance,"" in a discussion with CNBC TV18, after Trump's comments.As Prabhu Ram, Vice President of Industry Research Group, observes: ""Apple finds itself once again in the crosshairs of a belligerent 'America First' policy stance, navigating the tightrope between inflationary pressures and absorbing costs. While the tariff see-saw is likely to continue, planting more seeds for U.S. manufacturing, India's role as a critical cog in Apple's global supply chain will only grow stronger.""Counterpoint's Pathak maintains a pragmatic outlook: ""We still think these are very initial days and might evolve into something very different. This can go in different directions but we are maintaining our stand that China and India will continue to play a key role in manufacturing operations for Apple.""The reality is that Apple's supply chain decisions are driven by complex business considerations that extend beyond political pressure. For a company that earned approximately $400 in profit margins (about 36%) on each iPhone 16 Pro, dramatically increasing manufacturing costs could devastate its business model.Whether Apple will navigate these conflicting pressures by attempting some symbolic US manufacturing or doubling down on its India strategy remains to be seen. But the structural challenges that Steve Jobs identified over a decade ago haven't disappeared, making Trump's ""little problem"" with Apple a bigger manufacturing dilemma than a presidential directive can easily solve.","US President Donald Trump wants Apple to expand iPhone manufacturing in America, not India. The President claimed Cook agreed to increase US production, saying, ""I told Cook India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well"" The complex reality of global supply chains, labor markets, and manufacturing capabilities makes Trump's demand extraordinarily difficult to fulfill in the near term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121213067,imgsize-2188008,width-400,resizemode-4/Apple-CEO-Tim-Cook-greeting-customers-at-Apples-first-India-store-opening.jpg"

They argue that allowing such material undermines the tech giants' moderation claims and app store safety assurances. This action follows intense global criticism and regulatory scrutiny over AI-generated harmful content.

“immediately remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company's Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, addresses these disturbing and likely illegal activities.”

“Turning a blind eye to X's egregious behaviour would make a mockery of your moderation practices,”

“undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.”

Why Elon Musk’s xAI and Grok chatbot facing backlash

“deepfake”

“A descendant of Holocaust survivors was ‘digitally stripped’”

“anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”





Three US senators have written an open letter to Apple and Google . In the letter, which is addressed to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai , the senators have asked both companies to remove X and Grok apps from their respective app stores until owner Elon Musk stops users from creating and sharing non-consensual explicit images and child sexual abuse content.In the letter, US senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico called on the tech giants toThe senators said that the apps currently allow users to generate and distribute illegal content through their platforms. They also added that ignoring X's serious violations would make Apple and Google's content moderation practices meaningless.the senators wrote, adding that a failure to take action wouldGrok and X have recently allowed users to create and widely circulate explicit, sexualisedcontent involving people who did not consent to their images being used in this way. Grok has also been used to generate images that insult or degrade people based on race or ethnicity.In one recent case, The Times of London reported thatby Grok after users prompted the AI tool to create an image of her wearing a bikini outside Auschwitz.These concerns have led to intense criticism and regulatory scrutiny from governments in Europe, Malaysia, Australia, and India. In contrast, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice have not yet said whether they plan to investigate **xAI**.Earlier this month, Elon Musk and X released statements saying thatBoth Apple and Google have strict app developer rules that require steps to prevent the sharing of child sexual abuse material and other harmful or explicit content. Earlier, apps such as Tumblr and Telegram were temporarily removed from Apple’s App Store for failing to control inappropriate material adequately.More recently, X reportedly restricted Grok’s AI image generation tools to paying subscribers. However, Grok’s standalone app and website still allowed users to prompt the system to digitally undress, sexualise, or demean people without their consent.According to CNN, recent Grok feature changes and the limited safety controls were pushed by Musk. The report added that three members of xAI’s safety team announced their departures on X following these demands.Despite the backlash, xAI said this week that it raised $20 billion in new funding from investors, including Nvidia and Cisco Investments, as well as long-time Musk-linked backers such as Valour Equity Partners, StepStone Group, Fidelity, the Qatar Investment Authority, MGX, and Baron Capital Group.","US senators have urged Apple and Google to remove X and Grok apps, citing the platforms' alleged facilitation of non-consensual explicit images and child sexual abuse content.

‘Human intervention needed in complex codes’





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared insights from a code review of C++ generated by Anothropic’s LLM, saying that he was impressed but thinks that AI still have room for development. He also suggested that LLMs coding still need human intervention but there has been a significant improvement in such capabilities in the last two years.According to Vembu, the review went on for hours in the tech town hall and it provided him a clear understanding on how LLMs work.“Yesterday we had a tech town hall in Zoho where we did a code review of the C++ code generated by the Claude Opus 4.5 model. It went on for hours late evening,” Vembu said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“I now have a much clearer understanding of what these models do well: they are able to stitch together systems well, taking data from one system, reshape it and pass it to another system. There is often a lot of such ""glue code"" in these systems and that is not very complicated but it is very tedious,” he added.He also highlighted AI's strength in creating tedious “glue code” for system integration but noted that its tendency toward verbose outputs and reliance on memorised open-source patterns.“In general, AI models have ""memorized"" all the open source too and they are able to recall patterns from them (with some possibility of hallucination). They are also able to stitch various open source pieces together well,” Vembu pointed out.Vembu also highlighted that human orchestration proved essential during their review as it ensured usable results. He said that while AI excels at stitching components but it struggles with complexity.“Our senior engineer had guided (""orchestrated"" is the right word) this process. When the AI was stuck he helped ""unstuck"" it. This was a very vital contribution and without his experienced guidance, the AI output would not be useful,” he said.“We examined several C++ files with thousands of lines of code in each, looking for what I consider complex code. Most of it was straightforward glue code and only a tiny part of it was complex,” Vembu noted.“I suspect that the AI generated code tended to be needlessly verbose but I have to study it more to be sure. On the whole, I am both impressed and not super awed. I believe we can do better,” he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared insights from a code review of C++ generated by Anothropic’s LLM.

"YouTube revamps search filters, adds Shorts option",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-revamps-search-filters-adds-shorts-option/articleshow/126432845.cms,"Image Via ""X""

New search filters rolled out by YouTube



Dedicated Content Types: We’ve added a new Shorts filter to the 'Type' menu. This gives viewers more control over whether they see Shorts or VODs (long-form videos) in their search results, so you can find exactly what you’re looking for, regardless of format.

'Prioritize' Menu: The 'Sort By' menu has been renamed to 'Prioritize'. This refined sorting menu aims to maximize utility.

'Popularity' Filter: The 'View count' sort option has been renamed to 'Popularity'. This filter allows you to easily locate popular videos related to your search queries. Our systems assess a video's view count and other relevance signals, such as watch time, to determine its popularity for that specific query.





YouTube has rolled out new search filters which are designed to make finding videos easier and more intuitive. “We’ve heard your feedback and are enhancing the search experience by updating our filters to make them more effective and intuitive for everyone. Our goal is to equip you with more effective advanced search tools, ensuring you can consistently and efficiently locate the content you love,” said the company. One of the biggest changes rolled out by YouTube is a dedicated Short Filter which will enable users to specifically browse short-form clips or long-form videos. The update also reflects YouTube’s push to highlight its fast-growing Shorts format which competes directly with TikTok and Instagram Reels.We have made some key additions and renames to ensure our sorting options align better with your expectations:To streamline the experience, YouTube has removed two filters: Upload Date – Last Hour and Sort by Rating. The company said these options were not functioning as intended and contributed to user confusion. Broader upload date filters, such as “Today,” “This week,” and “This year,” remain available. “We are simplifying and reorganizing the filter menu to make it more intuitive and improve the overall search experience. This includes removing some options that were not working as expected and had contributed to user complaints,” added YouTube.","YouTube has rolled out new search filters which are designed to make finding videos easier and more intuitive.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft has announced multiple new AI tools that will let users buy products directly within the Copilot chatbot, without being redirected to external websites. Known as Copilot Checkout, the feature is now available in the US through partnerships with payment and commerce platforms, including PayPal , Shopify, and Stripe. The Copilot Checkout tool will allow online shoppers to ask for recommendations, compare options, and pay for items within a single chat window on Copilot. Early partners for this rollout include retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Ashley Furniture, and various Etsy sellers. In this partnership, merchants will remain the primary handlers of the transaction and customer data, while Microsoft will provide the AI interface for the purchase.Apart from this checkout feature, Microsoft has also released the Brand Agents AI tool for Shopify merchants, which will allow sellers to add AI assistants to their own websites. These agents are trained on the e-tailer’s specific product catalogue to answer questions and offer guidance in the brand’s specific tone. Shopify merchants will be automatically enrolled in the new checkout experience with an option to opt out.Microsoft Copilot’s new AI tools for online sellers: What are theyMicrosoft is launching a catalogue enrichment agent template in Copilot Studio as a public preview.

One of Elon Musk’s 'biggest worry' about China was on full display at America’s top tech show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-elon-musks-biggest-worry-about-china-was-on-full-display-at-americas-top-tech-show/articleshow/126443121.cms,"Hisense companion robots sit on display during the CES tech show in Las Vegas.

Cost factor works for Chinese robots





Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's big concern about China dominating the humanoid robots sector and leaving America behind was wide at display at this year's Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Chinese-made human-like robots were everywhere across the exhibition floor. One could see them playing table tennis, sweeping floors, practicing Kung Fu and more. In April 2025, Elon Musk warned America during a conference call that while he believes that Tesla Optimus robots lead in performance, China might ultimately dominate the field. ""I'm a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks 2 through 10 will be Chinese companies,"" Musk said, as reported by Bloomberg.As analysts say, China’s latest robotics innovations were delivered to the heart of America’s technology showcase, serving as a constant reminder of the technological race between the world’s two biggest economies. Several big and small Chinese robot creators occupied booths with their machines.Tencent-backed Agibot unveiled Genie Sim 3.0, its next-generation simulation platform. Genie Sim 3.0 is reportedly built on Nvidia Isaac Sim, which provides more realistic virtual environments for training and testing robots.Agibot, which made its US debut at CES, told Bloomberg that the system will cut training time and costs, and make it easier to transfer skills from simulation to the real world. Like many Chinese humanoid robot makers, Agibot hopes to expand overseas this year. A company official, who didn't want to be named, said that it plans to target markets with labor shortages, such as Japan, as well as countries like the US, where robots could also play promotional or entertainment roles.Chinese startups including EngineAI, Unitree, AgiBot and Galbot are leveraging artificial intelligence to help robots learn new tasks independently. Humanoid robot makers in China accounted for the vast majority of the roughly 13,000 units shipped globally last year, far outstripping US companies like Tesla Inc. and Figure AI in sheer volume, according to research firm Omdia. China’s leadership now may help the country as the number of robots is projected to surge to 648 million in 2050, according to research from Citigroup Inc.“Chinese vendors are setting benchmarks in large-scale production,” Omdia said. Pricing too reportedly works for Chinese humanoid robots as they are cheaper than Western-made models, with Unitree offering an entry-level model for just $6,000 and AgiBot asking about $14,000 for a scaled-down version. By comparison, Elon Musk has previously given a price range of $20,000 to $30,000 for Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots, which haven’t yet reached full-scale production.Omdia expects global humanoid robot shipments growing to 2.6 million units in 2035 as factors including AI models, dexterous hands and self-reinforcement learning have made the robots viable for industrial, service and eventual household roles. The research firm’s report covers two-legged humanoid robots as well as wheeled-based products with a human-like upper torso.Reports suggest that China is trying to build a globally competitive industrial ecosystem for humanoid robots, which government policies have prioritized as ""disruptive products,"" with the market expected to reach $43 billion by 2035.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk's big concern about China dominating the humanoid robots sector and leaving America behind was wide at display at this year's Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

Cloudflare CEO to Italy: You have no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on Internet outside your borders; calls Elon Musk right; read the wrong 'angry note',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cloudflare-ceo-to-italy-you-have-no-right-to-regulate-what-is-and-is-not-allowed-on-internet-outside-your-borders-calls-elon-musk-right-read-the-wrong-angry-note/articleshow/126442657.cms,"Cloudflare CEO's complete X post slamming Italy





Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is very upset with Italy. The reason is $17 million fine imposed on the company for defying Piracy Shield, a censorship tool lacking due process. Earlier this week, Italy’s communications regulator, AGCOM, slapped the San Francisco-based internet infrastructure giant with a €14 million ($17 million) fine for refusing to comply with the country’s Piracy Shield system. The penalty, the first major enforcement under a 2023 Italian law. Piracy Shield reportedly mandates that domain-name system providers like Cloudflare block access to websites accused of hosting pirated content within 30 minutes of notification from rights holders -- without court orders, appeals, or transparency. In a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, Cloudflare CEO lashed out at Italy. “No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency,” he wrote, highlighting risks to even Cloudflare’s own 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver.He further complained that the fine imposed is calculated as up to 2% of Cloudflare’s global revenue despite the company’s mere $8 million in Italian sales in 2024. Italy’s move comes amid rising European pressures on American technology companies that the Donald Trump government has been protesting over.Pointing to the same, Cloudflare CEO thanked US VP JD Vance and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Yesterday a quasi-judicial body in Italy fined @Cloudflare $17 million for failing to go along with their scheme to censor the Internet. The scheme, which even the EU has called concerning, required us within a mere 30 minutes of notification to fully censor from the Internet any sites a shadowy cabal of European media elites deemed against their interests. No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency. It required us to not just remove customers, but also censor our 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver meaning it risked blacking out any site on the Internet. And it required us not just to censor the content in Italy but globally. In other words, Italy insists a shadowy, European media cabal should be able to dictate what is and is not allowed online.That, of course, is DISGUSTING and even before yesterday’s fine we had multiple legal challenges pending against the underlying scheme. We, of course, will now fight the unjust fine. Not just because it’s wrong for us but because it is wrong for democratic values.In addition, we are considering the following actions: 1) discontinuing the millions of dollars in pro bono cyber security services we are providing the upcoming Milano-Cortina Olympics; 2) discontinuing Cloudflare’s Free cyber security services for any Italy-based users; 3) removing all servers from Italian cities; and 4) terminating all plans to build an Italian Cloudflare office or make any investments in the country.Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. While there are things I would handle differently than the current U.S. administration, I appreciate @JDVance taking a leadership role in recognizing this type of regulation is a fundamental unfair trade issue that also threatens democratic values. And in this case @ElonMusk is right: #FreeSpeech is critical and under attack from an out-of-touch cabal of very disturbed European policy makers.I will be in DC first thing next week to discuss this with U.S. administration officials and I’ll be meeting with the IOC in Lausanne shortly after to outline the risk to the Olympic Games if @Cloudflare withdraws our cyber security protection.In the meantime, we remain happy to discuss this with Italian government officials who, so far, have been unwilling to engage beyond issuing fines. We believe Italy, like all countries, has a right to regulate the content on networks inside its borders. But they must do so following the Rule of Law and principles of Due Process. And Italy certainly has no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on the Internet in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Brazil, India or anywhere outside its borders.THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIGHT AND WE WILL WIN!!!","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is very upset with Italy.

As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million? This ""Artificial Capable Intelligence"" benchmark, he believes, will reveal AI's real-world planning and decision-making prowess.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126366838,imgsize-28544,width-400,resizemode-4/126366838.jpg"

""Right after we acquired Blinkit, I asked him (Albinder) to leave. I told him, 'You will not be able to cut it.' He said okay. This happened twice during that timeframe, and we started the transition,""

""All of us have this armour. And when patient coaching runs out, I penetrate this armour. Me being angry is also because I care,""

What is Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal said about ‘rock bottom phase’



""rock bottom""

""I call this rock bottom, where I hurt people, their self-confidence completely goes for a toss. I do this with people who I think have insane potential, but something in their head is coming in their way,

""

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of Blinkit.

Meta has announced agreements with three nuclear power providers as the company aims to secure necessary resources for its AI ambitions. The Facebook-parent company has struck deals with Vistra, TerraPower and Oklo – all of which are working on nuclear power technologies. The company wants to use the power for Meta’s Prometheus supercluster computing system that’s being built at a data centre in New Albany, Ohio.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg first unveiled the Prometheus project in July, identifying it as the foundational infrastructure for developing “superintelligence.” The system is currently under construction at a data center in New Albany, Ohio, and is expected to go online later this year. Meta anticipates these new nuclear partnerships will add 6.6 gigawatts of carbon-free power to the grid by 2035.According to a report by CNBC, Meta will provide funding to extend the lifespan and boost the output of Vistra’s existing nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The company is also funding two projects currently under development, targeted for a 2032 startup. The deal includes an option for Meta to obtain power rights from six additional TerraPower projects by 2035.Thirdly, Meta will utilise Oklo’s ""advanced nuclear technology campus"" in Pike County, Ohio, which is slated to become operational as soon as 2030. Oklo is particularly notable due to its ties to OpenAI as CEO Sam Altman is one of the company’s largest investors.Meta previously joined Amazon and Google in a global pledge to triple nuclear energy production by 2050. This follows a 20-year agreement Meta signed in June with Constellation Energy to tap into the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois starting in 2027.“State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI,” said Joel Kaplan, Meta’s policy chief.

Weighing just 350 grams, it excels in close-up photography with impressive magnification. The lens features a quiet stepping motor for video and a customizable control ring. Compatible with Nikon's Hi-Res Zoom, it extends reach to 210mm.





Nikon has launched its latest Z-mount lens, the NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1, in India, bringing a versatile full-frame zoom option to its mirrorless lineup at an accessible price point of Rs 49,995.The new standard zoom covers everything from wide-angle landscapes at 24mm to medium-telephoto portraits and distant subjects at 105mm. Despite this flexibility, it weighs just 350 grams—light enough to comfortably carry through extended shooting sessions without causing fatigue.Close-up photography is where the lens shows some real promise. It focuses as close as 0.2 meters at the wide end and 0.28 meters when zoomed in, with a maximum reproduction ratio of 0.5× between 70-105mm. That's enough magnification to capture flowers, food, and small details with pleasing background blur that isolates your subject.Video shooters get a stepping motor that delivers fast, quiet autofocus without the distracting whirring sounds that can ruin audio. The lens also includes a customizable control ring that can be assigned to adjust focus, aperture, exposure compensation, or ISO sensitivity—whatever fits your shooting style.One of the highlights of this lens is its ability to work with Hi-Res Zoom on the following Nikon bodies: Z9, Z8, Z6III, Z5II, Zf, Z50II, and ZR. This has an effective range of 210mm, allowing for more flexibility when the photographer is not close enough to take a clear shot of the subject.Nikon has also included dust and drip resistance, although these are not touted as making the camera completely weather-tight. However, it is comforting to know that these are features in case the weather does not behave as expected.The NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1 will be available at Nikon outlets across India from mid-January 2026.","Nikon has launched its latest Z-mount lens, the NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1, in India.

Why TikTok may be planning to split up its US workforce







ByteDance may not allow all American TikTok employees to join the newly proposed US-based entity. Instead, the social media company is reportedly planning to split its US employees between two different corporate units. A report citing the company’s internal memos claimed that a portion of TikTok’s US workforce will join a new joint venture called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. Meanwhile, others will remain under a global entity owned by ByteDance, TT Commerce & Global Services LLC.According to a Business Insider report, staff assignments will be determined as per specific job roles and their relationship to the platform's global infrastructure. Employees focused on data protection and algorithm security are expected to be designated for the USDS Joint Venture, which will be led by investors including Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX.On the other hand, staff members working on commercial activities such as e-commerce, advertising, and marketing are expected to remain with the global entity, as these products remain tied to TikTok’s international operations.This transition, which is reportedly scheduled to conclude by January 22, is a part of ByteDance's broader effort to separate US operations from the parent company. TikTok CEO Shou Chew also reportedly informed staff that this structure will allow for the continuation of global commercial services while placing sensitive security functions under the oversight of the new US-led venture.If the TikTok deal happens, Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake would each own 15% of the new US joint venture. Companies connected to current ByteDance investors would get around 30%. While 5% of the company would go to a group of new investors yet to be named. Finally, ByteDance would retain just under 20% to comply with US ownership rules that forced the sale.The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requires companies based in countries the US considers foreign adversaries to sell their American operations or pay hefty fines. In this law, Congress specifically mentioned TikTok and China-based ByteDance. TikTok tried to fight the law in court but lost when the Supreme Court ruled against the company in January 2024.Last year, US President Donald Trump allowed the app to keep operating through executive orders while his administration worked with TikTok and potential buyers on a deal. In September 2025, the White House announced that an agreement had been reached with ByteDance. US Vice President JD Vance said the deal would value TikTok's US operations at around $14 billion.","The social media company is reportedly planning to split its US employees between two different corporate units.

According to a report by TechCrunch, this is ChatGPT-maker’s ninth acquisition in 12 months, and brings the startup’s three co-founders and their staff in an all-stock deal.According to the report, the acqui-hire is aimed at accelerating OpenAI’s “AI cloud efforts”. The company, however, is not acquiring Convogo’s intellectual property or technology, which means that Convogo will be shut down.Convogo originated as a “weekend hackathon” project by co-founder Matt Cooper. Over the past two years, the startup scaled quickly, partnering with some of the world's leading leadership development firms.In a farewell email to users, co-founders Matt Cooper, Evan Cater and Mike Gillett noted that their work revealed a gap between new AI model releases and “real-world outcomes”.“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences.That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry,” the founders wrote, as per the report.OpenAI has made several acquisitions over the past one year.

What changes Microsoft may be bringing to GitHub teams

""agent factory"".

“GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code. We want it to be the centre of gravity for all of AI-powered software development,”





Microsoft has reportedly started making major changes to GitHub teams. A report claims that the software giant has begun reshuffling teams within GitHub to prioritise the development of AI agents. This internal reorganisation is meant to help the platform compete with a new wave of AI-based coding tools, according to the report, which cited people with knowledge of the situation.A Business Insider article claims that the reorganisation is the result of a strategic choice to update GitHub's essential features. Microsoft hopes to transform the way the platform manages software development tasks by shifting resources towards AI agents, going beyond its conventional function as a code repository.The modifications are made as other AI tools become more competitive with GitHub. Specifically, tools from AI startups such as Cursor and Anthropic’s Claude Code have entered the market, offering alternative AI-driven environments for developers that have gained traction recently.In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion. While the platform has maintained a large user base due to its established position in the industry, the company is now adjusting its workforce to respond to the shift toward generative AI and automated coding assistants.In January 2025, Microsoft created a new group focused on building AI tools. The group is led by Jay Parikh, who previously worked as a lead engineer at Facebook. The group, called CoreAI Platform and Tools, brought together Microsoft's developer division, AI platform team, and GitHub.However, Microsoft and GitHub have stayed somewhat separate. Over the past few months, the company has been moving people and resources around to coordinate work across areas like sales better, the report claimed, citing a source familiar with the matter. The recent change involves moving a small group of Microsoft engineers to GitHub.As per the report, the goal of this move is to better compete with AI coding tools that rival GitHub Copilot. The company also wants to build AI agents and fulfil Parikh's vision to create anIn an internal meeting last year, Parikh discussed the need to change GitHub to compete with Cursor and Claude Code, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider.Parikh said at the time.Microsoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app. The report added that the company intends to make GitHub a dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.The recent changes are also part of what Parikh said would be a new investment in improving GitHub's core features. In the meeting, Parikh said those include making improvements to GitHub Actions, a tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code.Other improvements include analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security features to keep code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries.","Microsoft is reportedly reorganising GitHub teams to prioritize AI agent development, aiming to counter emerging AI coding tools.

In 2026, Gmail is tackling this problem by fully embracing the Gemini era, which will transform the traditional email application into an intelligent assistant. With the power of the Gemini 3, Gmail will be able to understand context, prioritise for urgency, and even answer questions embedded deep within years of emails. Simple but ambitious, the point of the change is to reduce inbox stress and let people take action faster.Threads in emails are among the greatest productivity killers. Decisive choices are engulfed by messages like delivery receipts, which are less important emails. AI Overviews solve this problem by summarising all the emails in a thread in a bite-sized, readable manner.In every case where a user asks a direct question to his or her mailbox, a direct answer is given by Gemini instead of a list of search results.The system is extremely useful in the case of applicable questions, for instance, in remembering the provider of a service, tracking decisions, and analysing previous agreements. Relevant answers to inquiries about information are acquired within seconds without manually browsing messages.Major advantages of AI overviews:The summaries for a conversation are being launched for all Gmail users, while the question-based AI Overviews are available for users of Google AI Pro/Ultra subscriptions.Sending emails can be a very repetitive task. However, automated emails tend to be impersonal in tone. Gemini-based writing assistance tries to maintain a smooth interface between speed and personal touch.is now in a position to write or edit a message with a greater appreciation for what is taking place within this conversation. Suggested Responses not only provide a way to respond through a series of phrases, and they also do this based on this conversation and your writing patterns. These responses have been written with a first draft that could have been written by yourself.Secondly,is another enhancement that evaluates grammar, tone, as well as the message’s clarity. It is not just looking to correct any grammatical errors, but rather to make sure that the tone is fitting for the circumstance. It is expected that further changes will offer even greater levels of personalisation because ‘Gmail is set to use information from various Google services in order to make the messages reflect the style that suits every individual. ’One of Gmail’s most anticipated changes is the AI Inbox, designed to cut through daily inbox noise. Rather than relying entirely on manual filters or categories, Gemini evaluates importance based on behaviour and relationships.The AI Inbox creates a brief overview of what requires attention, helping users focus on deadlines, reminders, and messages from important contacts. Less urgent emails remain accessible but no longer dominate the top of the inbox.What AI Inbox concentrates on the most:Google has announced that this process is all carried out in a secure and privacy-enhancing way. This service is currently undergoing trials with select users.All of these features are powered by Gemini 3, Google’s most advanced AI model so far. The rollout begins in the United States and in English, with more regions and languages planned over the coming months. Some tools are free for all Gmail users, while advanced capabilities are part of premium AI subscriptions.Taken together, these updates mark a turning point for Gmail. The Gemini era is not about replacing human judgment, but about removing friction, turning email into something that works quietly in the background, helping users stay organised, informed, and in control.For many years, Gmail’s strength lay in storage and search. Users learned to label, filter, and keyword-search their way through overflowing inboxes. Gemini changes this relationship entirely. Instead of expecting users to adapt to the system, Gmail now adapts to the user.Gemini allows Gmail to interpret conversations, recognise relationships, and understand intent across emails. This means the platform no longer treats messages as isolated items, but as connected information streams. Whether it’s a year-long renovation discussion or a short family exchange, Gmail can now grasp the bigger picture behind the words.","Summaries of lengthy or complicated e-mail messages or groups of messages.Natural language questions rather than keyword searches.Easier access to historical information contained in emails.

Google, Meta, Netflix, Microsoft, Amazon and other US technology companies may soon have good news in Europe. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the European Commission is planning to present a new proposal called the Digital Networks Act on January 20. The plan, led by EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen, aims to improve Europe’s competitiveness and increase investment in telecom infrastructure. The report quotes sources familiar with the matter who said that under the draft plan, the tech companies would be covered by a voluntary framework rather than binding rules. Telecom operators, in contrast, will continue to face mandatory obligations.The European Union has introduced several new technology laws in recent years, which have drawn criticism from the United States. US officials have argued that the rules unfairly target American tech companies, a claim the EU has rejected.One source said the companies would be encouraged to cooperate and share best practices through discussions overseen by EU telecom regulators, with no new legal requirements. ""They will be asked to cooperate and discuss voluntarily, moderated by EU telecoms regulators' group BEREC. There will be no new obligations.It will be a best practices regime,"" one of the sources told the publication.The proposal also includes measures to align rules on spectrum licensing across the EU. These would cover licence duration, sale conditions and pricing methods used in spectrum auctions. The plan also sets out guidance on fibre network rollout and allows countries to delay the 2030.","European Commission to present new proposal on January 20.

What will be the agenda of Apple’s 2026 annual shareholders meeting

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s invite for annual shareholders meeting

To our shareholders,

This has been an exceptional year at Apple. We are so excited about all the ways we are sharing our products, pushing the limits of what’s possible, and making technology that empowers people and enriches their lives.

This is an ideal moment to reflect on where we are today, and in that spirit, I’d invite you to join us for the 2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on February 24, 2026, where we’ll celebrate all we’ve accomplished over the past year.

Our latest iPhone lineup features the most powerful iPhone we’ve ever made with iPhone 17 Pro, and the thinnest iPhone we’ve ever made with iPhone Air. Along with iPhone 17, our entire lineup features incredibly advanced camera systems, powerful performance, and all-day battery life our users love.

"Backed by Amazon, IXI Eyewear's smart glasses adjust focus using eye movements",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/backed-by-amazon-ixi-eyewears-smart-glasses-adjust-focus-using-eye-movements/articleshow/126434009.cms,"IXI Eyewear smartglasses (image credit: IXI Eyewear)

How IXI Eyewear’s adaptive lens technology works



Why IXI Eyewear’s smart glasses are different from Meta and Google’s approach



What the lenses look like in real use



Who these adaptive smart glasses are for



A quiet shift in how vision correction could work







A Finnish startup called IXI Eyewear is betting that the future of vision correction does not involve switching between reading glasses, progressives, or bifocals. Instead, it involves smart glasses with adaptive lenses that automatically adjust focus based on where your eyes are looking.The company has raised $40 million in funding, with backing from investors including Amazon, and says it plans to launch its first consumer product within the next year. The goal is simple on paper but difficult in practice: glasses that handle near and far vision on their own, without users having to think about it.No cameras. No augmented reality overlays. Just vision, corrected in real time.At the core of IXI’s product is a combination of eye-tracking sensors and liquid crystal lenses built directly into the frame. The sensors monitor subtle eye movements to determine whether the wearer is looking at something close up, like a phone, or farther away, like a road sign. The lenses then adjust their focus instantly.According to the company, as reported by CNN, all of this happens automatically and continuously. There is no manual switching, no visible transition, and no need to tilt your head into a “sweet spot,” which is a common frustration with progressive lenses.IXI’s current prototype weighs about 22 grams, roughly the same as standard lightweight eyeglasses. That detail matters. Heavy frames are one of the reasons earlier smart eyewear never made it into everyday use.Most smart glasses on the market today focus outward. Cameras. Microphones. AI features. Augmented reality displays. Companies like Meta and Google are chasing computing platforms that sit on your face.IXI is doing the opposite. Its glasses look inward. There are no outward-facing cameras and no social features baked in. The technology exists purely to solve a vision problem: how to see clearly at different distances without juggling multiple prescriptions.That narrow focus is deliberate. As per CNN reports, IXI CEO Niko Eiden says the company is not trying to replace smartphones or build an AR headset. It is trying to replace traditional corrective lenses.The adaptive lens design does come with trade-offs. The liquid crystal system is concentrated in the central portion of the lens, where vision clarity matters most.“The center part is the sharp area, and then there is the edge where the liquid crystal stops and which is not that great to look into,” Eiden told CNN. “But the center area is large enough that you can use that for reading.”In other words, there are distortions at the edges. IXI’s position is that most of the time, wearers will not notice them because natural vision tends to rely heavily on the center of the lens anyway.This is not entirely new territory, but it is the first time the company believes the technology is small and fast enough for daily wear.IXI has been clear that these glasses will sit at the high end of the eyewear market. Pricing has not been announced, but Eiden has said they will be positioned alongside premium prescription glasses, not budget frames.The target audience is people who currently rely on multiple pairs of glasses or struggle with progressive lenses. Presbyopia, age-related near-vision loss, is one of the biggest drivers.For these users, the appeal is straightforward. One pair of glasses. No compromises. No switching.There is something almost old-fashioned about IXI’s approach. While much of the tech industry chases attention and features, this product focuses on function. Seeing clearly. Comfortably. All day.The company has opened a waitlist on its website, though it has not said which regions will get access first. If IXI can deliver what it promises, these autofocus smart glasses could change how people think about corrective eyewear.Not by adding more technology to our lives, but by removing one small, daily frustration.","Finnish startup IXI Eyewear is betting that the future of vision correction does not involve switching between reading glasses, progressives, or bifocals.

Tesla bull Ross Gerber reveals he is not a Elon Musk fan





Tesla Bull Ross Gerber co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management has now sharply criticised CEO Elon Musk ’s claims about its car company’s autonomous driving ambitions. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Gerber accused Musk of making ‘hallucinations’ during conference calls that fail to materialise, pointing Tesla’s missed goal of launching driverless Robotaxis by the end of 2025.Gerber emphasised that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system remains ‘problematic’, despite offering Level 2 autonomy. While he previously praised improvements in the software, he has since highlighted persistent issues. “The robotaxis are still just Ubers. The robot is far from working. Car sales are falling,” Gerber wrote, adding that Tesla’s lofty valuation — with a price‑to‑earnings ratio near 300 — is unsustainable.“The CEO makes claims (hallucinations) on conference calls that don't even come remotely true... FSD still nags me at level 2. The robotaxis are still just Ubers. The robot is far from working. Car sales are falling.Yet the PE is 300. Something has got to give. $tsla Tesla continues to test its autonomous technology, with Musk recently claiming he was driven around in Austin in a Tesla Robotaxi. The company’s Cybercab prototype has been spotted in California and Texas, with Musk promising production scale‑up this year. He also commented on Nvidia’s new Alpamayo self‑driving platform, calling distribution the biggest challenge for scaling autonomy.Speaking at the Chasing Finance podcast, Gerber said, “I’m not a fan of Elon. But I’m not going to deny the fact he builds great products.” Gerber who is the co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki wealth and Investment Management has often been seen as one the Tesla’s most vocal bulls. Yet in recent months, he has grown increasingly critical of Musk’s leadership.In November, Gerber blasted Tesla for spending money to promote Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package, even as the company struggled to sell cars. Large investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, opposed the pay plan, citing dilution risks and Musk’s outsized influence. Despite his frustrations, Gerber acknowledged Musk’s relentless work ethic and ability to build companies that command investor premiums. “He’s built some big companies and he’s succeeded,” Gerber said.",Ross Gerber is the co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management.

Reality Labs hemorrhaging billions amid strategic pivot

Make or break moment for Zuckerberg's hardware vision





Meta's Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth has scheduled what he's calling the ""most important"" all-hands meeting of the year for January 14, with managers making an unusual push for employees to show up in person. The directive comes as the Reality Labs division braces for another round of potential cuts following months of strategic upheaval.Two Meta employees told Business Insider that the emphasis on in-person attendance is highly unusual for the division, which oversees the company's virtual reality, augmented reality, wearables, and a nascent robotics unit. Some managers have reportedly told staff to ""drop what they're doing"" to attend the meeting in person.The meeting follows a turbulent period for Reality Labs, which has racked up over $70 billion in losses since 2020 as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pursued his metaverse vision. Last month, Business Insider reported that Meta was considering budget cuts of up to 30% and potential layoffs within the division.Meta has already slashed Reality Labs twice in the past year. In April, the company laid off employees from Oculus Studios and its Supernatural VR fitness team.Those cuts followed broader January 2025 layoffs that eliminated nearly 4,000 roles companywide, with at least 560 affecting Reality Labs.The company has shifted its focus toward AI and away from the metaverse, with Zuckerberg investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI last year and poaching top researchers from OpenAI and Google DeepMind. Meta has also redirected investments toward its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which have become a surprise hit.In a memo obtained by Business Insider earlier last year, Bosworth described 2025 as ""the most critical"" year in his eight-year tenure at Reality Labs. ""This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,"" he wrote.Meta did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the upcoming meeting."," Meta's Reality Labs division has racked up over $70 billion in losses since 2020.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. This decision of the company comes after weeks of mounting criticism over Grok’s misuse, with users exploiting the tool to create sexualised deepfake images of women and children. “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Recently, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok rolled out a feature which allowed the users to create sexualised images of women without their consent. The chatbot faced widespread criticism. The tool can take pictures from social media platform X including mages of real people, and digitally alter them to remove clothing or depict them in lingerie and bikinis.The situation after the rollout of an ""edit image"" button in late December, which lets users modify any image on the platform.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished.Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman calls California Billionaire tax a horrendous idea







Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have now shifted an entity tied to them out of California, beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax targeting the state’s richest residents. As reported by Business Insider, the fillings revealed that T-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and long managed from Palo Alto is converted into a Delaware-based company called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025. The new filling reviewed by Business Insider also lists Reno, Nevada as its principal office with Brin and Page remaining managers. This move from Brin and Page comes as California is considering a 5% one-time tax on billionaires, a ballot measure slated for November 2026.If the California wealth tax gets approved then a tax would apply retroactively to residents as of January 1, 2026.

Hoffman further revealed that Rep. Ro Khanna had reached out to discuss the proposal and Hoffman made his opposition clear. “One well‑documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal,” Hoffman wrote. “Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.”","Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have now shifted an entity tied to them out of California.

Amazon HR sends 'what you did last year' email to corporate employees; says: Provide 'specific examples' of ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-hr-sends-what-you-did-last-year-email-to-corporate-employees-says-provide-specific-examples-of-/articleshow/126427839.cms,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy

Why this change at Amazon matters





After laying off 14,000 employees last year, e-commerce major Amazon has now introduced a sharper question for its corporate workforce. As reported by Business Insider, Amazon has now asked its employees to list three to five accomplishments from the past year. As part of the annual performance review process, internally known as Forte, the employees will now have to provide specific examples of projects, goals or initiatives that demonstrate their impact. Along with this, the employees will also have to outline the actions they plan to take in order to continue growing at the company.According to internal guidelines obtained by Business Insider, this marks the first time Amazon has explicitly formalised Forte around individual accomplishments. Earlier the reviews were focused on broader self-assessments asking the employees about their super powers’ or how they contribute when at their best. This new approach of Amazon stresses of measurable outcomes and the company is also encouraging the staff to highlight the risks or innovations that didn’t fully succeed.""Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,"" the internal guideline states.""Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn't lead to the results you hoped for.""At Amazon, Forte is the key driver of compensation. Managers weigh employee accomplishments alongside peer feedback, adhere to Amazon’s leadership Principles and job-specific skills to assign an “Overall Value” rating, which determines annual pay. This new shift at Amazon reflects CEO Andy Jassy’s push for discipline and accountability, following last year’s return‑to‑office mandate, management cuts, and pay model overhaul.This move by Amazon mirrors the tougher stance across Silicon Valley. Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also demanded weekly accomplishment reports at Witter in 2022. On the other hand, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared a “year of intensity.” Tech giant Google also tightened its perforce expectations from employees recently.This change in the review process of companies marks the departure of a softer and employee‑friendly review process.","Amazon has now asked its employees to list three to five accomplishments from the past year.

The company will optimise all the content for quick viewing. “Disney is bringing vertical video to Disney+ in the U.S. this year, which follows the successful launch of “Verts” on the ESPN app. The experience will evolve as it expands across news and entertainment and delivers a more personalized, dynamic experience that reinforces Disney+ as a must-visit daily destination,” said the company.The executives unveiled the plan of vertical videos at Disney’s Tech and Data showcase during CES 2026 in Las Vegas, US.

Samsung forecasts record Q4 profit as AI-driven chip demand lifts prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-forecasts-record-q4-profit-as-ai-driven-chip-demand-lifts-prices/articleshow/126419977.cms,"Samsung Electronics anticipates a significant surge in its fourth-quarter operating profit, nearly tripling year-over-year to a record high. This boost is attributed to soaring memory chip prices and robust demand fueled by artificial intelligence investments. The company's strong performance underscores the global race to expand chip manufacturing capacity to meet escalating AI-driven needs.

Record quarterly profit forecast



AI demand lifts chip prices







Samsung Electronics has projected a sharp rise in its fourth-quarter operating profit, driven by higher memory chip prices and strong demand linked to artificial intelligence. According to a Reuters report, the company said operating profit for the October–December period is expected to nearly triple from a year earlier, reaching a record level. The forecast highlights how tight supply and rising demand for memory chips used in data centres, personal computers and smartphones have pushed prices higher. Samsung’s results come as global chipmakers race to expand capacity to meet growing AI-related needs, even as concerns remain about rising costs for device makers and data centre operators.Samsung estimated operating profit of 20 trillion won ($13.82 billion) for the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing. This compares with 6.49 trillion won a year earlier and is higher than market expectations of about 18 trillion won. The figure would mark Samsung’s highest quarterly operating profit on record, surpassing its previous peak in 2018.Samsung shares ended the day down 1.6%, after earlier rising to a record high.The stock has gained about 155% over the past year.Rising prices for conventional memory chips have supported earnings across the sector. Demand has increased as companies invest heavily in AI servers and data centres.“The world is going to need more fabs and the reason for that is because of this new industry called AI factories,” said Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “It’s good to be a semiconductor manufacturer,” he added, saying demand was “really, really quite terrific.”Market tracker TrendForce said contract prices for certain DRAM chips rose more than 300% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier and are expected to rise further in the current quarter.","Record quarterly profit forecast is attributed to soaring memory chip prices and robust demand fueled by artificial intelligence investments.

Google Gemini momentum has been the biggest story of 2025

CEO Sundar Pichai on strong demand





Google is CRUSHING and CRUISING. For the first time since 2019, the search giant beat Apple on Wall Street. Google parent company Alphabet saw its market capitalization surpass that of iPhone-maker Applefor the first time since 2019. According to a report in CNBC, Alphabet’s market cap closed at $3.88 trillion on Wednesday, January 7. Alphabet stock increased more than 2%, closing at $322.03. Meanwhile, Apple’s market cap closed at $3.84 trillion as shares fell over 4% over the last five days.Shares of Alphabet jumped as much as 65% in 2025, the company’s sharpest rally since 2009, when the stock doubled coming out of the financial crisis. The performance comes after a tough start to the year, as Google closed out 2025 with its strongest performance — from Wall Street’s perspective. Among the eight tech companies valued at over $1 trillion, Alphabet was by far the biggest gainer.Google ended 2025 as one of the top performers on Wall Street, making a grand AI (artificial intelligence) comeback. In August, Google launched image generator Nano Banana, a Gemini feature that allows users to use AI to generate images. The feature went viral soon after launch. By the end of the following month, the Gemini app surpassed 5 billion images and dethroned OpenAI’s ChatGPT at the top of Apple’s App Store.In December 2025, Google rolled out Gemini 3 to rave reviews. Google launched Gemini 3 almost eight months after rolling out Gemini 2.5.Gemini 3's success is said to have made OpenAI CEO Sam Altman send 'Code Red' warning to company's employees.Not just in AI, Google is also making rapid strides on hardware front. In November, the company unveiled Ironwood, the seventh generation of its Tensor Processing Units (TPU), a custom AI chip that has emerged as a potential alternative to chip giant Nvidia’s offerings. Google has also signed Meta as one of its TPU customers. The news wiped billions from Nvidia market cap. Not just this, it also made Nvidia issue a public clarification claiming how and why Google TPUs do not threaten the company.Analysts have also highlighted Google’s broad strength in cloud computing, where it’s chasing Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, and the company’s leadership in robotaxis through Waymo as drivers boosting company's stock in 2025.Google CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said that the company is responding to soaring demand. During October earnings call, he said that Google’s cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter of the year than in the two prior years combined.As for Apple, iPhone 17 sales are off to a strong start. This bodes well for Apple's fiscal 2026 potential. However, Apple has remained largely absent from the tech industry’s AI race that kicked off when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022. But rumours say that Apple may tap Google here now as the company has promised to launch the “more personal Siri” in 2026. This again is likely a win-win for Google and Apple both.","Google parent company Alphabet saw its market capitalization surpass that of iPhone-maker Applefor the first time since 2019.

“Not this person. This person is trying to build the future of AI.”

“We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes, I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”

What is California’s billionaire’s tax





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he is not worried about a proposed tax on billionaires in his home state of California. Even though the tax could cost him over $7 billion, Huang stated that he is” because he and his company chose to live in Silicon Valley for its talented workforce. He explained that he values the region and is willing to accept the taxes that come with staying there.In an interview with Bloomberg, Huang said his primary focus is on his technology work, not his personal taxes. He said,He further explained his choice to remain in the state by saying,Nvidia was founded in a California restaurant over 30 years ago and, under Huang's leadership, it has grown into the world's most valuable company.The proposed plan involves a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' total wealth in the state to help fund services such as health care and education. Huang, who is currently the ninth-richest person in the world, said in the interview that he has not spent any time worrying about the bill.He mentioned that while other wealthy tech leaders may be upset about the potential cost, he has not even thought about it once.If the tax proposal passes, Huang could end up paying one of the state's most significant tax bills. He's worth $155.8 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, meaning the 5% tax on his wealth would cost him over $7.8 billion.Nvidia became one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies by creating the computer chips that power artificial intelligence. The company started in a Denny's restaurant in San Jose, California, in 1993, and is now headquartered in nearby Santa Clara.While Jensen Huang said he plans to stay in the state, several other billionaires decided to move before the January 1 residency deadline. On New Year’s Eve, Peter Thiel said he was opening a Miami office for Thiel Capital as he shifted his residency to Florida. Venture capitalist and current AI czar David Sacks also said he was leaving California for Austin.","The proposed plan involves a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' total wealth in the state to help fund services such as health care and education.

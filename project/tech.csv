"Google to shut down Tables, offers migration tools ahead of closure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-to-shut-down-tables-offers-migration-tools-ahead-of-closure/articleshow/123837740.cms,"



Google has announced that it will shut down its work-tracking and automation tool — Tables. Designed to rival Airtable, Google Tables will shut down completely by December 11, 2025. This decision marks the end of a five-year run for the app, which started as an experimental project under Google’s Area 120 incubator before graduating to the Google Cloud portfolio.As reported by TechCrunch, in a email sent to its users, Google has advised to export data to Google Sheets or migrate to AppSheet, its no-code platform. A dedicated migration tool has been introduced to help users to preserve formatting, column types and workflow automations during transition.Launched in 2020, Tables was created to streamline project management, IT operations, CRM and recruiting workflows via automation and customisable views. The tool became popular due to its flexibility and simplicity. However, it could not sustain long-term support amid Google’s broader restructuring.This shutdown follows the earlier closure of Area 120, which also witnessed half of its projects canceled in 2022 and a pivot toward AI-focused initiatives. While Tables survived that initial reorganization, it now joins the ranks of Google’s discontinued experiments.Users are encouraged to act before the December deadline to avoid data loss.","Google has announced that it will shut down its work-tracking and automation tool — Tables.

Gmail adds new “Purchases” tab to simplify package tracking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gmail-adds-new-purchases-tab-to-simplify-package-tracking/articleshow/123837568.cms,"



Google is now making it simpler for users to keep a tab of their online orders. With a new Gmail update, the tech giant has introduced a dedicated ‘Purchases’ tab. This new tab will offer a more streamlined view of all the upcoming package deliveries to the users. Along with this, it will also keep the users informed about their past orders.The new tab is created on Gmail’s present package tracking feature. First launched in 2022, the feature enabled users to see delivery updates directly in their inbox. Now, instead of digging through emails or visiting carrier websites, users can simply open the Purchases tab to view shipment statuses, expected arrival dates, and order history.Google believes that this feature will prove to be quite useful during the upcoming holiday season. According to PwC’s 2025 holiday outlook, 39% of gift spending is expected to occur between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday — making efficient tracking more important than ever.Along with the Purchases tab, Gmail is also updating its Promotions category, enabling users to sort promotional emails by “most relevant” and receive nudges about timely deals from their favorite brands. This update will roll out in the coming weeks on mobile for personal Google accounts.The Purchase tab update is already live for Gmail users on both mobile and web.","The Purchase tab update is already live for Gmail users on both mobile and web.

US highways may have Chinese ‘problem’: Officials to check these equipments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-highways-may-have-chinese-problem-officials-to-check-these-equipments/articleshow/123835449.cms,"Representative Image

Why solar equipment on highways is worrying US officials



""That could create a lot of havoc,""

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





US officials have issued a warning against solar-powered highway infrastructure, a report claims. The Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration has reportedly cautioned officials that solar equipment on US highways, including chargers and traffic cameras, may contain hidden radios and other rogue Chinese devices. An advisory from the department has also suggested that these components should be inspected. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, a four-page security note from the department stated that undocumented cellular radios had been found in ""certain foreign-manufactured power inverters and BMS"" (battery management systems). However, the note did not specify the country of origin, but many inverters are made in China. The warning comes amid escalating government concerns about the presence of Chinese technology in US infrastructure.As per the Reuters report, US officials are increasingly worried that inverters and battery management systems could be embedded with hidden components enabling remote interference by Beijing. The report also cited Anomadarshi Barua, a George Mason University academic who has written about security weaknesses in inverters, which convert solar or wind energy into usable electricity and has explained how they could be exploited to send rogue commands or cause power surges.Barua cautioned, noting that it may be used to disrupt roadside infrastructure or, in the future, interfere with systems that keep autonomous cars operational.In May, Reuters reported that US officials grew concerned after experts discovered rogue communication devices in some Chinese inverters and batteries. Green Power Denmark later said similar unexplained components were found in imported equipment for its energy grid.The Federal Highway Administration’s advisory cited reports of “undocumented cellular radios” in inverters and batteries, warning they could pose a risk. The US Department of Transportation said the advisory ""summarises public and unclassified reporting to ensure agencies are implementing practical mitigation steps.""The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded that it opposed ""the distortion and smear of China's achievements in the field of energy infrastructure.""","US officials have issued a warning against solar-powered highway infrastructure, a report claims.

Marks & Spencer's CTO Rachel Higham exits the company and this may be the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/marks-spencers-cto-rachel-higham-exits-the-company-and-this-may-be-the-reason/articleshow/123834891.cms,"What M&S said about the exit of its Chief Digital and Technology Officer



“Rachel has decided to take a break and is stepping back from her role, having been a valued part of the leadership team. She has been a steady hand and calm head at an extraordinary time for the business and we wish her well for the future.”





Rachel Higham, the Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Marks & Spencer (M&S), is leaving the company, a report claims. This comes months after a cyberattack that caused hundreds of millions of pounds in damage to the UK-based retail chain and disrupted its systems. A report by the new agency Reuters cited Sky News to claim that her departure was announced in a recent internal memo shared by the company. Higham, who is a former executive at WPP and BT Group, was hired by M&S early last year in June to lead its technology functions. In the internal memo, the company noted that Higham had made her decision to take a break from work, which was the reason behind her exit.In a statement about Higham’s exit, a M&S spokesperson said to Reuters:The company spokesperson also noted that Higham’s departure has led to a broader reorganisation of roles. Longtime executive Sacha Berendji will now oversee the digital and technology division alongside his existing responsibilities for property and store development, the Reuters report added.In addition, Thinus Keeve, who joined as retail director in June, will shift from reporting to Berendji to reporting directly to Chief Executive Stuart Machin, Reuters noted.In April, M&S suffered a cyberattack, which was carried out by a group known as Scattered Spider.This hacking incident disrupted the retailer’s online operations and highlighted the rising risk of such threats. The retailer has since restored its click-and-collect service and expects insurance to cover part of the losses.In May, the company estimated the breach would reduce operating profit in the 2025/26 financial year by about £300 million ($405 million). However, it aimed to offset roughly half that impact through insurance claims and tighter cost controls.Last month, M&S told Sky News it was not seeking to replace Higham. However, the latest report also didn’t mention whether she would receive a payoff.","Rachel Higham, the Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Marks & Spencer (M&S), is leaving the company, a report claims.

A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership.

How Bytedance’s Seedream compares to Nano Banana



5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has reportedly launched its new image generation tool, Seedream 4.0. The company claims that it outperforms Google DeepMind's popular Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as ""Nano Banana""). The company's Seed department stated that Seedream 4.0 boasts strong image editing capabilities, positioning it in direct competition with Google's tool, which has garnered widespread acclaim for its consistent and accurate image editing. ByteDance claims that Seedream 4.0 beat Gemini 2.5 Flash Image on its internal evaluation benchmark, MagicBench, with better performance in prompt adherence, alignment, and aesthetics. However, the company has not published these results in an official technical report.This comes after Google’s Nano Banana AI 3D figurine trend exploded on social media. This image-generating tool enables anyone to create customisable, hyper-realistic mini figurines with ease. Their playful design, creative flexibility, and shareable appeal have made them a favourite among creators and collectors.ByteDance said Seedream 4.0 introduces a new architecture that accelerates raw image inference by more than 10 times compared with earlier models, making it faster to use.Early user feedback has highlighted the editing tool’s precision, with quick image adjustments possible through text prompts.The tool is available domestically via ByteDance’s Jimeng and Doubao AI apps, and to enterprise customers through its Volcano Engine cloud platform.According to a report by the South China Morning Post, AI benchmark company Artificial Analysis has noted that Seedream 4.0 marked a “significant evolution” from earlier ByteDance tools by combining the text-to-image functions of Seedream 3.0 with the editing features of SeedEdit 3.0, while maintaining the exact price of $30 per 1,000 generations.At present, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image leads the company’s rankings for both text-to-image generation and image editing, while Seedream 4.0 has not yet been assessed. Seedream 3.0 currently stands fifth in text-to-image and sixth in editing.On Fal.ai, a global generative media hosting site, Seedream 4.0 costs US$0.03 per generated image, compared with US$0.039 for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.China has rapidly adopted AI-driven image and video generation, with competition heating up among tech companies, including Kuaishou Technology and Tencent Holdings. The government has supported the sector by recognising copyright for AI-generated content in late 2023, while also mandating labels on such material.The market has also seen an influx of competitively priced products, such as Vidu, a video generation tool created by Tsinghua University and start-up Shengshu AI. Earlier this week, Vidu added a reference-to-image feature internationally, enabling generation from up to seven reference images at 0.62 yuan (US$0.09) per image. In comparison, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image supports up to nine references."," ByteDance claims its new image generation tool, Seedream 4.0, outperforms Google DeepMind's popular Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as ""Nano Banana"") This comes after Google’s Nano Banana 3D figurine trend exploded on social media.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123833706,imgsize-993314,width-400,resizemode-4/tiktok-parent-bytedance-launches-new-ai-tool-to-rival-googles-nano-banana.jpg"

Nepal social media ban and crisis explained





Oracle's shares have dipped slightly a day after a record-breaking surge that pushed the company's market valuation to a record $933 billion. The enterprise software maker's stock was down 2.2% in early trading, following a 35.9% climb in the previous session driven by substantial gains in its AI cloud business and multi-billion-dollar cloud deals. The surge also caused Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison's net worth to soar by nearly $100 billion to $392.6 billion. Ellison briefly surpassed Elon Musk as the world's richest person, though Musk later reclaimed the top spot with a fortune of $439.9 billion, according to Forbes global wealth rankings. However, a new report by the news agency Reuters has predicted that Ellisson may soon overtake Musk to reclaim the world's richest person title once again.Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said to Reuters. He added that the company’s multi-billion-dollar demand forecast has set off a “ripple effect” across AI-related stocks.Microsoft-backed AI OpenAI has signed a $300 billion agreement with Oracle for computing power, which is one of the largest ever, and it likely represents most of the new revenue Oracle highlighted recently.As per the Reuters report, Oracle’s stock has almost doubled in 2025, ranking among the strongest performers in the S&P 500 and surpassing the gains of the so-called Magnificent Seven.On September 10, Larry Ellison claimed the top spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time in his career as his net worth had climbed to $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk, who had led the global wealth rankings since 2024.Ellison’s rise was driven by Oracle’s recent earnings report, which showed higher-than-expected quarterly results, an increase in bookings, and a strong outlook for its cloud business. The news triggered a 41% single-day jump in Oracle’s stock, the largest in the company’s history. Since Ellison’s wealth is mostly in Oracle shares, this added $101 billion to his fortune in one day.At the same time, Musk’s net worth declined as Tesla shares fell 13% in 2025, reducing his wealth to $385 billion and ending his run at the top briefly. Tesla’s board has proposed a performance-based compensation plan that could make Musk the first trillionaire if future goals are met.","Oracle's shares dipped slightly a day after a record-breaking surge that pushed the company's market valuation to a record $933 billion.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





The Reserve Bank of India is reportedly planning to allow loan lenders to remotely lock mobile phones purchased on credit if borrowers fail to make their EMI payments. The move aims to help curb the country's rising levels of bad debt but is expected to spark significant consumer rights concerns, news agency Reuters reported citing two sources familiar with the matter.The plan reportedly marks a change from last year, when the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) instructed lenders to stop the practice of using apps to lock devices belonging to defaulting borrowers. Reuters reported that following consultations with financial institutions, the RBI is now expected to update its Fair Practices Code within the coming months to include specific guidelines on phone-locking mechanisms.The report further says that these new rules will require lenders to obtain prior consent from borrowers and will strictly prohibit them from accessing any personal data on the locked devices.“The RBI wants to ensure that lenders have the power to recover small-ticket loans, and at the same time ensure that customers' data is protected,” Reuters quoted one source as saying.The proposed measure comes as small-ticket loans for consumer electronics, particularly mobile phones, have become increasingly common, the report said, adding that as per a 2024 study by Home Credit Finance, more than one-third of consumer electronics in India are purchased this way.With over 1.16 billion mobile connections in a country of 1.4 billion people, this lending practice has a massive market reach.Loans under Rs 1,00,000 are especially prone to default, showing some of the highest delinquency rates, according to credit bureau CRIF Highmark. Non-bank lenders account for a significant 85% of consumer durable loans, the report noted.If implemented, the new rules could benefit major consumer lenders like Bajaj Finance, DMI Finance, and Cholamandalam Finance by improving loan recoveries and making it easier to lend to customers with poor credit histories.However, consumer advocates have warned that the policy may have severe consequences for millions of people.""This practice weaponises access to essential technology to enforce behavioral compliance, locking users out of livelihoods, education, and financial services until repayment,"" said Srikanth L., founder of the advocacy group CashlessConsumer.",The Reserve Bank of India is reportedly planning to allow loan lenders to remotely lock mobile phones purchased on credit if borrowers fail to make their EMI payments.

"After eight years, Spotify finally adds CD-quality streaming",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-eight-years-spotify-finally-adds-cd-quality-streaming/articleshow/123829810.cms,"What you'll actually need to hear the difference





Well, it only took them eight years, but Spotify has finally delivered on those lossless audio promises. The streaming service quietly rolled out CD-quality sound, bringing 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC streaming to users who've been waiting since, well, forever.The best part? No extra fees. While everyone expected Spotify to launch some fancy ""HiFi"" tier with a higher price tag, they're just giving it to existing Premium subscribers. Users are getting notifications in their apps when the feature goes live, and from there it's a simple toggle in the media quality settings.The rollout has already started in a dozen countries including the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, with plans to hit 50 markets by October. There’s no word for when it’ll be available in India, but we can expect it by next month, when the feature expands to other countries.Here's where things get a bit technical, but stay with me. To actually hear the difference, you'll need proper headphones or speakers—and they need to be wired or connected through Spotify Connect. Your AirPods won't cut it since Bluetooth doesn't have enough bandwidth for lossless files.The feature works on phones, tablets, and computers, plus compatible gear from Sony , Bose, Samsung, and others. Sonos and Amazon devices are getting support next month.Now, Spotify's version isn't quite as fancy as what Apple Music or Tidal offers—they go up to 24-bit/192 kHz while Spotify stops at 44.1 kHz. But honestly, unless you're a serious audiophile with expensive equipment, you probably won't notice the difference.This whole saga started back in 2017 when Spotify first hinted at hi-fi quality. They kept promising it was ""almost ready"" year after year, apparently dealing with licensing headaches behind the scenes. Better late than never, though the competition definitely got there first.","Spotify is rolling out 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC streaming to Premium subscribers.

Months after the demise of OpenAI researcher and whistleblower, CEO Sam Altman has finally broken silence. In a recent interview with former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, Altman said that Balaji’s death was a suicide. Carlson asked Altman: “Do you think he committed suicide?”. To this, OpenAI CEO replied “I really do”, adding, “He was like a friend of mine. This is like a guy that, not a close friend, but this is someone that worked at Open AI for a very long time. I was really shaken by this tragedy. I spent a lot of time trying to, you know, read everything I could as I'm sure you and others did too about what happened. It looks like a suicide to me.""The 26-year-old researcher at ChatGPT-parent OpenAI was found dead at his apartment in San Francisco in December last year. The police then said that “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. The San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office also ruled his death a suicide.However, Suchir Balaji’s parents kept reiterating then his death was not a suicide. Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao, in a Business Insider revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT.“He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” she then said, describing how her son transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded sharply to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s remarks terming Suchir Balaji’s death as suicide. In a post on X, Musk wrote “He was murdered”, quoting a video of the interview where Altman said he believes Balaji’s death was a suicide.During the conversation, Carlson questioned Altman: “You had complaints from one programmer who said you guys were basically stealing people’s stuff and not paying them, and then he wound up murdered. What was that?”.Altman replied saying “Also a great tragedy. He committed suicide”.","Sudhir Balaji, 26, a researcher at ChatGPT-parent OpenAI was found dead at his apartment in San Francisco in December last year.

Jassy cuts Bezos-era pet projects to focus on proven winners



CEO's high-margin business strategy drives Amazon's profit surge





Amazon CEO Andy Jassy learned a costly lesson from watching Jeff Bezos burn billions on experimental ventures like the Fire Phone flop, failed grocery stores, and countless moonshot projects that drained resources without delivering returns. Bezos' willingness to lose money on ambitious long-term bets ultimately contributed to Amazon becoming the first company to shed $1 trillion in market value during the post-pandemic crash. Now Jassy has fundamentally shifted how Amazon uses its money.Unlike his predecessor, who famously burned through billions spreading investments across hundreds of experimental projects—from satellite internet ventures to healthcare moonshots like Haven that shuttered after three years—Jassy has narrowed Amazon's focus to ""a few dozen initiatives"" he considers genuine opportunities, sources familiar with his leadership tell Business Insider. The new CEO witnessed firsthand how Bezos' scatter-shot spending approach often prioritised bold innovation over immediate profitability, creating a costly pattern of ambitious failures alongside Amazon's successes.The strategic realignment has already delivered results. Amazon's stock has surged more than 30% over the past year, while profit per employee jumped to $44,100—five times the 2022 figure. The company recently crossed a $2 trillion market cap after nearly losing $1 trillion in value during the post-pandemic downturn.Jassy's skeptical approach extends to internal metrics that Bezos championed, particularly ""downstream impact"" measurements that attempted to quantify indirect benefits from projects like Alexa. The voice assistant, once a flagship product, became one of the first major casualties under Jassy's leadership due to mounting losses and inability to generate sustainable revenue.""Jassy wants to focus on things that Amazon is uniquely positioned to do a good job on,"" a former vice president told Business Insider, highlighting the CEO's preference for businesses with clear profit paths over speculative ventures.The concentrated investment strategy has particularly benefited Amazon's most profitable divisions. Under Jassy's leadership, the company introduced advertising to its Prime Video streaming service and dramatically increased spending on cloud data centres—both areas generating significantly higher margins than traditional retail operations.This disciplined approach represents Amazon's return to what Jassy calls operating ""the world's largest startup,"" emphasising efficiency and measurable returns over the growth-at-any-cost mentality that defined much of the Bezos era.","Andy Jassy is the new CEO of Amazon, replacing Jeff Bezos.

EU court rules in favor of Meta and TikTok on supervisory fees: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-court-rules-in-favor-of-meta-and-tiktok-on-supervisory-fees-report/articleshow/123826130.cms,"

What the court said

How European Commission and companies respond





Meta Platforms and TikTok have won a legal case against the way European Union regulators calculated a supervisory fee charged under the Digital Services Act (DSA). According to a report by news agency Reuters, the companies will not get any refunds for now, but the court has given the European Commission 12 months to fix the calculation method. The cases were registered as T-55/24 - Meta Platforms Ireland v Commission and T-58/24 - TikTok Technology v Commission.The DSA, in force since November 2022, requires large online platforms to take stronger action against illegal and harmful content or risk fines of up to 6% of their annual global revenue. Along with Meta and TikTok, other companies paying supervisory fees include Amazon, Apple, Booking.com, Google, Microsoft, X (formerly Twitter), Snapchat and Pinterest.The Luxembourg-based General Court said that the EU’s methodology for calculating the fee should have been adopted under a delegated act, not through implementing decisions. Judges ruled that the European Commission must reformulate the process within a year but does not have to repay the 2023 fees already collected.Meta and TikTok, owned by ByteDance, were charged 0.05% of their annual worldwide net income to cover the EU’s monitoring costs.They argued the system was unfair and led to disproportionate fees, as companies reporting losses did not have to pay even if they had a large user base.The European Commission said the ruling confirms the fee principle is valid and only requires a “formal correction” in procedure. “We now have 12 months to adopt a delegated act to formalise the fee calculation,” a spokesperson said.TikTok welcomed the decision, saying it would follow the development of the new rules closely. Meta also supported the judgment, calling for flaws in the methodology to be corrected.","Meta Platforms and TikTok have won a legal case against the way European Union regulators calculated a supervisory fee.

Tesla's dominance in the American electric vehicle (EV) market is waning as a growing number of rivals erode the company's once-unassailable lead, according to exclusive data shared with Reuters by research firm Cox Automotive.The data reveals that Tesla's U.S. market share plummeted to a near eight-year low in August, falling below 40% for the first time since October 2017. Tesla, which once commanded over 80% of the U.S. EV market, accounted for just 38% of total EV sales last month.According to a Reuters analysis of Cox data, Tesla's market share in July fell to 42% from 48.7% in June, marking the sharpest drop since March 2021, when Ford launched its Mustang Mach-E EV.The decline highlights a critical challenge for Tesla: its aging product lineup. While competitors are aggressively launching new models and increasing incentives, Tesla's most recent vehicle, the Cybertruck pickup, has not matched the success of its earlier models like the Model 3 and Model Y. A recent refresh of the Model Y, once the world’s best-selling car, has failed to meet expectations, putting the company on track for a second consecutive year of sales decline.""I know they’re positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you’re a car company, when you don’t have new products, your share will start to decline,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights, in an interview with Reuters.The slump in its core auto business comes as CEO Elon Musk has shifted focus to other ambitious ventures, including humanoid robots and robotaxis, reportedly delaying and canceling plans for more affordable EV models. Much of the company's trillion-dollar valuation is pinned on these long-term bets. Last Friday, Tesla's board proposed a monumental $1 trillion pay package for Musk, tied to the company's value reaching an astounding $8.5 trillion in the next decade.The news also emerges during a difficult period for the broader EV industry. Analysts quoted by Reuters anticipate a temporary increase in EV sales through September as consumers rush to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits. However, this is expected to be followed by a sharp drop in October, increasing financial pressure on all automakers, including Tesla.Adding to the company's challenges, Musk’s public political activities and his association with President Donald Trump have also been cited as a factor hurting the brand's image among some buyers. Although he had a falling out with the Republican president in May, his previous involvement in guiding Trump's efforts to reshape the U.S. government has been a source of controversy.","Tesla's U.S. market share fell to an eight-year low in August as buyers shifted to newer EV models from rivals, Cox Automotive data showed. The decline highlights a critical challenge for Tesla: its aging product lineup. Tesla's most recent vehicle, the Cybertruck pickup, has not matched the success of its earlier models.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123815570,imgsize-48362,width-400,resizemode-4/tesla23.jpg"

40% Stock Gain and the AI Factor

* AI-Specific Cloud Deals:

* Massive Deal Book:

* Agressive Forecast:





Oracle stock roared 40% higher on Wednesday, September 10, after reporting smashing cloud demand numbers, setting the company on track for a historic gain. The cloud computing giant is on pace for its best day since the year 1992, and is now quickly approaching the $1 trillion market cap benchmark. Oracle is now at $950 billion. In the past year, Oracle has emerged as one of the biggest benefactors of the artificial intelligence boom thanks to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are both needed to run large workloads.Oracle's business model, historically centered on enterprise database software and licenses, has undergone a dramatic transformation, with a strategic pivot to cloud computing. This shift is the key to understanding the company's recent 40% stock surge, which marked its largest single-day gain since 1992. It traces back to 1977, when Ellison, Bob Miner and Ed Oates founded Software Development Laboratories in Santa Clara, California. The company won the contract from the CIA to build a database program code-named Oracle.Five years later, in 1986, the company changed its name to Oracle and went public. Throughout the four decades, Oracle has found various levels of success in technology, but most recently in demand for its data center capacity from AI customers. Here are the key businesses of Oracle:For decades, Oracle's primary revenue streams came from selling on-premise software licenses and the lucrative, high-margin support contracts that followed. However, the company has successfully expanded its business model to include a full suite of cloud services, including:This is the foundation of Oracle's new growth, providing the raw computing power, storage, and networking resources.This is where the company is now directly competing with giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.A platform for developers to build and run applications.Oracle's applications, such as its ERP and CRM solutions, are now offered on a subscription basis in the cloud.The unprecedented jump in Oracle's stock was not driven by a single earnings report, but by a powerful narrative shift. Most analysts are now confident that Oracle's cloud business is not just a side project but a central player in the AI boom. Several factors contributed to this re-evaluation:Oracle announced a series of multi-billion-dollar contracts with major AI players, including a landmark deal with OpenAI. These contracts highlight Oracle's ability to provide the massive, specialized computing power required for training and running large AI models. The size and prestige of these customers validated Oracle's cloud strategy.The company's remaining performance obligations—a measure of future contracted revenue—surged to an astonishing $455 billion. This figure, more than four times Google's backlog according to Bloomberg, signaled a huge pipeline of future growth and revenue stability.Oracle's leadership provided an exceptionally bullish outlook for its cloud infrastructure business, projecting that its annual revenue from this segment could grow from $18 billion this fiscal year to $144 billion by 2030. This aggressive forecast, a rare move for a company of its size, electrified investors.In essence, the stock market's reaction was a clear signal that it has re-rated Oracle's business. While its legacy software business remains a cash cow, the company is now being valued as a high-growth AI infrastructure provider, capable of capturing a significant share of the trillions of dollars expected to be spent on AI development in the coming years.","Oracle stock roared 40% higher on Wednesday, September 10, after reporting smashing cloud demand numbers.

"Larry Ellison: Deal wins that made Oracle's Larry Ellison world's richest man, beating Tesla CEO Elon Musk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/contract-that-made-larry-ellison-worlds-richest-man-beating-tesla-ceo-elon-musk/articleshow/123813023.cms,"The 81-year-old executive's net worth expanded significantly after Oracle Corp. presented an optimistic forecast for its cloud operation.

Four deals that made Larry Ellison world's richest

In the first quarter, Oracle signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three separate customers, CEO Safra Catz said in an earnings release on Tuesday, September 9.

Oracle CEO Safra Catz on stock's 40% jump in one day





In what can be termed as a seismic shift for the tech world, Oracle Corp. shares surged more than 40% on Wednesday, September 10, marking the company's largest single-day gain since 1992. The dramatic rally came after Oracle revealed an unprecedented contract with OpenAI and offered a highly aggressive outlook for its cloud business, cementing its position in the high-stakes race for artificial intelligence computing.The stock's explosive performance pushed Oracle's market valuation to a staggering $969 billion, briefly making co-founder Larry Ellison the wealthiest person in the world, surpassing Elon Musk . A $101 billion single-day gain pushed Ellison’s fortune to $393 billion, ahead of Musk’s $385 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.A key driver behind the surge is Oracle's strategic move into the red-hot cloud computing sector, where it is emerging as a critical provider of AI infrastructure. The company is now a direct competitor to cloud giants Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.According to Bloomberg, the centerpiece of Oracle's success is a landmark deal signed earlier this summer with ChatGPT operator OpenAI. The contract, described as ""unprecedented,"" provides OpenAI with 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity—enough energy to power millions of American homes.Oracle also counts Nvidia and ByteDance's TikTok among its major cloud customers.These high-profile contracts have drastically boosted Oracle's ""remaining performance obligations""—a measure of future bookings—to an astonishing $455 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. This figure is more than four times higher than the same period a year earlier. Bloomberg Intelligence analysis highlights the significance of this milestone, noting that it's also reportedly roughly four times Google's backlog, suggesting that Oracle’s cloud growth rate is poised to surpass its rival.Oracle CEO Safra Catz characterized the quarter as ""astonishing,"" stating that demand for the company's cloud infrastructure continues to build. She revealed that Oracle signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter and expects to push remaining performance obligations above half a trillion dollars in the coming months.Looking ahead, Catz said the cloud infrastructure business is projected to expand by 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year and reach a monumental $144 billion in annual revenue by May 2030.The strong forecast overshadowed an otherwise mixed earnings report. While cloud infrastructure revenue increased by 55% to $3.3 billion, both adjusted revenue of $14.9 billion and profit of $1.47 per share fell slightly short of analyst expectations. Investors, however, are now focused on Oracle's long-term potential, despite concerns over the high cost of building new data centers, with capital expenditures projected at $35 billion this year.","Oracle Corp. shares surged more than 40% on Wednesday, September 10, marking the company's largest single-day gain since 1992.

"Microsoft sends company wide memo, asks employees to return to office; read the full letter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-sends-company-wide-memo-asks-employees-to-return-to-office-read-the-full-letter/articleshow/123811445.cms,"Microsoft considered stricter RTO policy earlier this year



Read the full memo sent to employees:



How we work has forever changed. I remember starting at Microsoft in the late '90s, always in the office, no laptops, and primarily working with the people right down the hall. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. Then the pandemic reshaped everything. It pushed us to think differently about work, to connect like never before (thank you Teams!), reminded us of how much we value being together, and gave us focus and autonomy in the traditional workday. We're not going back, and we shouldn't. Instead, we should take the best of what we've learned and move forward.

In the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time.

We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together.

With that in mind, we're updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office.

We'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US.

Our goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs.

For some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work.

What you need to know:

Puget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. Please connect with your manager and team to understand your organization's plans. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19.

Managers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint.

All employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise.

Timelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint.

As always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career. Let's keep moving forward together.

Thank you,

Amy

GST Rate Cut: Electronics to Get Cheaper from Sept 22





Microsoft is implementing a new policy that requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week. This mandate was detailed in an internal email sent to staff by Microsoft HR chief Amy Coleman. According to the memo, the new return-to-office (RTO) policy will roll out in three phases. The first phase, starting in late February 2026, will affect Seattle-area employees who live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office.The policy will then be extended to other US offices before being implemented internationally. Employees have until September 19 to request an exception, though the email did not provide specific details on how the exception process will work.Reports suggested that Microsoft was considering a stricter RTO policy for some time now. Compared to its other tech giants, Microsoft has reportedly been more lenient than competitors like Amazon, and even Zoom, which sent its employees back to the office part-time in 2023.Microsoft's initial flexible work policy, introduced in late 2020, allowed employees to work from home for at least half of the time. This new three-day-a-week requirement brings Microsoft in line with similar policies at Meta and Google.","Microsoft is implementing a new policy that requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week.

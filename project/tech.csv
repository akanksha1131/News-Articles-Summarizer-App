"AI chatbots like ChatGPT can be dangerous for doctors as well as patients, as ..., warns MIT Research",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-chatbots-like-chatgpt-can-be-dangerous-for-doctors-as-well-as-patients-as-warns-mit-research/articleshow/122076203.cms,"FILE (AP Photo/Richard Drew, file)

A new study from MIT researchers reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) used for medical treatment recommendations can be swayed by nonclinical factors in patient messages, such as typos, extra spaces, missing gender markers, or informal and dramatic language. These stylistic quirks can lead the models to mistakenly advise patients to self-manage serious health conditions instead of seeking medical care. The inconsistencies caused by nonclinical language become even more pronounced in conversational settings where an LLM interacts with a patient, which is a common use case for patient-facing chatbots.Published ahead of the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, the research shows a 7-9% increase in self-management recommendations when patient messages are altered with such variations. The effect is particularly pronounced for female patients, with models making about 7% more errors and disproportionately advising women to stay home, even when gender cues are absent from the clinical context.“This is strong evidence that models must be audited before use in health care, where they’re already deployed,” said Marzyeh Ghassemi, MIT associate professor and senior author. “LLMs take nonclinical information into account in ways we didn’t previously understand.”Lead author Abinitha Gourabathina, an MIT graduate student, noted that LLMs, often trained on medical exam questions, are used in tasks like assessing clinical severity, where their limitations are less studied. “There’s still so much we don’t know about LLMs,” she said.The study found that colorful language, like slang or dramatic expressions, had the greatest impact on model errors. Unlike LLMs, human clinicians were unaffected by these message variations in follow-up research. “LLMs weren’t designed to prioritize patient care,” Ghassemi added, urging caution in their use for high-stakes medical decisions.The researchers plan to further investigate how LLMs infer gender and design tests to capture vulnerabilities in other patient groups, aiming to improve the reliability of AI in health care.","Large Language Models (LLMs) used for medical treatment recommendations can be swayed by nonclinical factors in patient messages.

Walmart Inc President and CEO Doug McMillon emphasized the company's desire for a level playing field and consistent policies in all countries where it operates, stating that Walmart is well-equipped to navigate the current tariff challenges better than any other retailer. ""We operate in many countries, and we consistently ask for a level playing field everywhere,"" McMillon told the Economic Times when questioned about India. ""We engage with various governments, sharing our views on changes needed to better serve customers, but we don't set the rules—we comply with them.""Talking about the goal for India market, Doug McMillion said, Walmart will announce the next goal for India once it reaches the target of annually sourcing goods worth $10 billion from the country by 2027. He went on to highlight Walmart's preference for local sourcing and job creation, noting, ""We like to buy locally, create jobs, and benefit from shorter lead times, especially for food and consumables."" Media reports suggest that the Trump administration is pushing India to grant full access to its $125 billion e-commerce market for companies like Amazon and Walmart as part of ongoing bilateral trade agreement (BTA) negotiations, expected to conclude by next month. McMillon clarified that Walmart is not directly involved in these government-to-government talks.In India, e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are prohibited from holding inventory or selling directly to consumers, unlike local firms such as Reliance Retail and Tata Group. Doug McMillon stressed the importance of clear and predictable regulations, saying, ""The more things are transparent and consistent, the better it is for business, whether in India or globally.""On the possibility of Flipkart holding inventory in India, McMillon noted, ""We have expertise in inventory management and would be happy if the rules allowed it, but we leave rule-making to others.""Addressing tariffs, Doug McMillon said Walmart's sourcing capabilities give it an edge. ""We've been managing tariffs since 2018, and our experienced merchants can adapt by making different sourcing choices,"" he said. ""We prioritize buying locally to create jobs and reduce lead times, though this is easier for food than general merchandise.""McMillon underscored Walmart's commitment to low prices, stating, ""Keeping the cost of living low is our priority. Low prices are in our DNA, and we aim to maintain a price gap with competitors to deliver value to customers globally.""Regarding India, McMillon expressed optimism about Walmart's sourcing goals, saying, ""We’re on track to source $10 billion annually from India by 2027, with an expanding range of categories. It’s encouraging to see this progress."" He added that Walmart will continue sourcing from both India and China and will announce new targets for India once the current goal is achieved.","Doug McMillon said Walmart is well-equipped to navigate the current tariff challenges better than any other retailer.

What Workday said about the lawsuit



Hidden bias in AI hiring tools and why automation may not always be fair



Redmi Pad 2: Know these Things Before Buying!

Hiring software provider Workday is facing a class action lawsuit that alleges its AI-powered job applicant screening system has an ""ageist"" problem. The lawsuit claims that Workday’s AI-powered system discriminates against candidates aged 40 and over. The lawsuit builds on an employment discrimination complaint filed last year by Derek Mobley against the company. Mobley's initial suit alleged that the company's algorithm-based system discriminated against applicants based on race, age, and disability. According to a report by Forbes, four more plaintiffs have now joined the lawsuit, specifically accusing Workday of age discrimination .In an email sent to Forbes, a Workday spokesperson denied allegations that their technology contains bias. The company said, “This lawsuit is without merit. Workday’s AI recruiting tools do not make hiring decisions, and our customers maintain full control and human oversight of their hiring process. Our AI capabilities look only at the qualifications listed in a candidate’s job application and compare them with the qualifications the employer has identified as needed for the job. They are not trained to use—or even identify—protected characteristics like race, age, or disability. The court has already dismissed all claims of intentional discrimination, and there’s no evidence that the technology results in harm to protected groups.”The Workday spokesperson also noted that the company has recently implemented measures to ensure that the software they use adheres to ethical standards.As per data compiled by DemandSage, an estimated 87% of companies are reportedly using AI for recruitment in 2025. The report notes that these companies rely on tools like Workable, Bamboo HR, and Rippling for the same.While these systems help automate hiring, a study by the University of Washington from last year revealed that they are often biased. AI tools can show traits of racial, gender, and socioeconomic biases from the data they’re trained on or from the algorithms themselves.One of the examples is Amazon's scrapped AI tool that discriminated against women and resume filters that favour elite education or specific language patterns, often excluding underrepresented groups.","Workday is facing a class action lawsuit that alleges its AI-powered job applicant screening system has an ""ageist"" problem.

Bumble’s latest layoffs mark second major cut in 2 years



Dating app giant Bumble has announced that it will lay off approximately 240 employees, representing 30% of its global workforce. Despite the significant staff reduction, shares of the company surged by 16% in premarket trading following the news, reports said.According to news agency Reuters, the company anticipates incurring non-recurring charges between $13 million and $18 million for employee severance, benefits, and related expenses, primarily in the third and fourth quarters of 2025.Bumble expects these layoffs to result in annual cost savings of around $40 million, which it plans to reinvest into key areas like product and technology development.Bumble also raised its second-quarter revenue forecast to a range of $244 million to $249 million, an increase from its previous outlook of $235 million to $243 million.A Bumble spokesperson said that the layoffs were “not made lightly.”“Our focus now is on moving forward in a way that strengthens our core business, continues to serve our members effectively, and positions us for future growth,” the spokesperson said, according to CNBC.Bumble’s job cuts are part of a reconfiguration of its “operating structure to optimise execution on its strategic priorities.”This latest job cuts follows a previous significant reduction in February of last year (2024), when the company laid off around 350 employees, representing 37% of its workforce. The 2024 layoffs followed a disappointing first-quarter revenue and a challenging economic environment characterised by a slowdown in user spending.At the time, Bumble stated its intention to “reduce its global workforce by approximately 350 roles to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities and to drive stronger operating leverage.”Bumble joins a growing list of tech giants, including Microsoft , Amazon, and Intel, that have cited various reasons for workforce reductions this year, contributing to a broader trend of significant shifts in the sector.","Bumble has announced that it will lay off approximately 240 employees, representing 30% of its global workforce.

Europe risks falling behind in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race due to excessive regulation, warned Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung. Speaking at a tech conference hosted by the German firm in Stuttgart, Hartung asserted that “Europe is unnecessarily delaying its AI future with excessive regulation.”Bosch, which holds the majority of AI patents in Europe, says it is committed to advancing the technology, with plans to invest an additional 2.5 billion euros (approximately $2.90 billion) in AI by the end of 2027.Hartung emphasized that the combination of bureaucracy and ""strict, but also vague, requirements"" is making Europe less attractive for AI development compared to other regions. He urged lawmakers to limit their regulatory efforts to a framework covering only the most crucial aspects.“Otherwise, we will regulate ourselves to death, because we are trying to regulate against technological progress,” he cautioned.Hartung's remarks come amid increasing pressure in the AI development race, especially following President Donald Trump's announcement in January of a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to fund AI infrastructure.Earlier this year, US Vice President JD Vance issued a stern warning to European leaders, cautioning that their extensive AI regulations could hinder innovation and stifle the burgeoning industry. Vance also strongly condemned content moderation, labeling it “authoritarian censorship” and outlining the Trump administration's “America First” approach to maintaining US dominance in AI.Speaking at a summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris, Vance articulated the U.S. opposition to the European Union's stricter regulatory stance.“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,” Vance stated, according to a Reuters report.Vance specifically targeted the EU's Digital Services Act and GDPR privacy rules, arguing that such regulations impose undue financial burdens and endless compliance costs on smaller businesses.","Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung says Europe risks falling behind in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race due to excessive regulation.

A high-profile wedding celebration party for Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez has been moved from central Venice to a more secure, isolated location, reports Reuters. The report quotes sources familiar with the matter who said that the venue change comes due to fears of protests and safety concerns. Originally planned for Cannaregio, a bustling nightlife area in Venice, the wedding party has now been shifted to the Arsenale — a 14th-century former shipyard in the Castello district.Protestors welcomed the party venue change. “The news that Bezos has run away from the Misericordia is a great victory for us,” said Tommaso Cacciari, a leader of the “No Space for Bezos” campaign, referring to the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, the initially chosen venue.According to a report by The Sun, the couple has reportedly chosen a stunning open-air theater on a Venetian island as their wedding venue. “The word is that they have booked the theater which has been restored,” a source told the publication. ""It's not your usual venue for a wedding, it would be iconic,” the source added.""Everyone is talking about the wedding and it's going to be a huge celebration.""The wedding celebrations are expected to take place over three days, likely from June 26 to 28. While the exact date of the wedding is not known yet, rumours suggest that the couple may tie the knot on June 27.According to reports, nearly 90 private jets are expected to land in the Italian city. The Guardian reports that Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, her husband, Jared Kushner, and their children are among the first guests to arrive. The family is reportedly staying at the St Regis, close to St Mark’s Square.Other VIPs expected to attend include Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria, and Orlando Bloom, with Bill Gates, Mick Jagger, and Elton John also possibly on the guest list.The wedding is rumoured to cost around $9.5 to $ 11 million, the NewsNation reports. This estimated cost is based on various calculations, including expenses for hair, the dress, flowers, and the wedding planner.As per CEOWorld, top-tier wedding planners like Colin Cowie can charge up to 20% of the total wedding cost to organize a flawless multi-day celebration — which means for a wedding costing at least $9.5 million, his fee could be a staggering $2 million. Dress, hair, makeup and flowers may make up to $525,000.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding has been moved from central Venice to a more secure, isolated location.

Camera upgrades: This model boasts a 48-megapixel primary camera sensor, offering significant improvements in daylight, low-light, and portrait photography compared to its predecessor.

Battery life: Apple claims the iPhone 15 has ""all-day battery life,"" though real-world usage suggests it can last over 9 hours with average usage.

Processor: Powered by Apple's A16 Bionic chip, an upgrade from the A15 chip used in the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, with Pro models receiving the faster A16 chip.

Charging port: Notably, the iPhone 15 features a USB Type-C charging port, replacing the Lightning port used in previous models and aligning with the more commonly used USB Type-C standard.

Fresh stolen data could fuel next wave of online crime

Immediate action required for all users

Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases, potentially affecting users of major platforms including Facebook Gmail , Apple, and countless other services. The discovery, made by CyberNews researchers during an ongoing investigation since January 2025, represents what could be the largest credential leak in history.The exposed datasets range dramatically in size, from smaller collections containing tens of millions of records to massive databases housing over 3.5 billion credentials each. The massive trove of stolen data was briefly accessible through unsecured databases before being locked down, though researchers were unable to identify the owners. Most concerning is that virtually all datasets were previously unreported, with only one 184-million-record database having been disclosed before by Wired magazine in May.The leaked credentials span virtually every major online service imaginable, creating a ""blueprint for mass exploitation,"" according to the research team. The databases contain login information for social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, email services including Gmail, developer platforms such as GitHub, messaging apps like Telegram, VPN services, and even government portals.Each record typically follows a standard format: website URL, username, and password. This structure matches the collection methods used by infostealer malware, malicious software designed to harvest sensitive information from infected devices.“Telegram's primary login method is a one-time-password delivered by SMS. As a result, this is far less relevant for Telegram users compared to other platforms where the password is always the same,” Telegram said in a statement to TOI.Unlike recycled data from old breaches, researchers emphasise this represents ""fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale."" The credentials provide cybercriminals with unprecedented access for account takeovers, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing campaigns that can devastate both individuals and organisations.CyberNews researchers warn that new massive datasets emerge every few weeks, highlighting the pervasive nature of infostealer malware in today's digital landscape. The inclusion of recent logs with tokens, cookies, and metadata makes this data particularly dangerous for organisations lacking multi-factor authentication.With approximately 5.5 billion people having internet access globally, the breach potentially affects multiple accounts per person. Security experts recommend immediate password changes across all online accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible, and using password managers to generate unique, strong passwords.Users are also advised to regularly monitor their accounts and consider using services like ""Have I Been Pwned"" to check if their credentials have been compromised.Apart from this, it's always better to use the latest software versions, enable automatic updates and access only secure, trusted URLs (preferably HTTPS) while avoiding links in unsolicited email messages.","Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases.

‘No Space For Bezos’ Movement Explodes: Street Revolt Brews Ahead Of Bezos & Sanchez Lavish Wedding

Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sachez wedding gift for guests

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez , engaged for two years, are reportedly set to wed next week in Venice, Italy, with a star-studded guest list. An insider revealed to the Daily Mail that VIP attendees will receive lavish gifts, including hand-blown glassware from local Venetian glassmaker Laguna B.According to the publication, Jeff Bezos’ $500 million superyacht, Koru, will be anchored off San Giorgio Maggiore island, home to the historic 16th-century Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore. The insider noted that the island will be closed to visitors from June 24 to June 29, with Venice’s mayor speculating the wedding may take place on the yacht. A private tender service will reportedly ferry guests between the island and the yacht.The report further said that Bezos has reserved the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, one of Venice’s grandest historic buildings, from June 26 to June 28, though its connection to the wedding remains unclear. The guest list, expected to be under 200, may include celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and members of the Trump family.The Italian source told the Daily Mail that each guest will receive custom glassware from Laguna B, a company founded by Marie Brandolini, who was inspired by traditional Murano glassmaking. Her son took over after her passing in 2013, per Vogue. The vibrant, handcrafted glassware, featuring stripes and floral designs, retails for $167 per large cup.The insider further added that guests will receive additional “opulent” gifts, though specifics remain undisclosed. Lauren Sanchez is known for her love of designer bags, such as the $5,750 Balenciaga 9AM Coffee Cup Clutch Bag and a $7,000 crystal-adorned Judith Leiber UFO-inspired bag gifted by the Kardashian family after her Blue Origin space trip.The report said that Rosa Salva Venetia, a local bakery, will provide pastries like tiramisu, cream-filled pastries, and fritelli for the multi-day celebration, though it will not supply the wedding cake. According to a 2023 Vogue interview, Bezos has left the wedding planning to Sanchez, ensuring an extravagant affair.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are reportedly set to wed next week in Venice, Italy.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage . Speaking at the Business Routable’s CEO Workforce Forum, Dimon asked the coperate leaders to not wait for the government fixes and should directly partner with the schools to close the growing talent gap. “What you’re really short of is the skills you need,” Dimon said, pointing to critical areas like cybersecurity, coding, project management, and financial literacy . He stressed that the companies must invest in education pipelines and push for curricula which blends job-ready credentials with traditional academics.Jamie Dimon who is an advocate of workforce development , feels that continous mismatch between available jobs and qualified candidates act as a threat to economic growth and innovation across multiple sectors ranging from advanced manufacturing and healthcare to technology and financial services.He also mentioned that global estimates suggest that 10 millions of jobs will go unfilled by 2030 due to lack of skilled talent.""We need to break down the barriers between education and employment ,"" Jamie Dimon stated at a recent economic summit. ""It's time to build a system that helps people learn, adapt, and thrive throughout their careers—not just at the start.""Dimon asked for high-schools and colleges to offer workplace focused courses as part of their curriculum. The billionaire banker also stressed that businesses can’t rely solely on four-year degrees. “They all want jobs,” he said of young graduates. “But many end up in retail or inventory roles, when there are jobs in coding, cyber, and financial management.”Jamie Dimon is also calling for unprecedented collaboration between the private sector, government agencies, and educational institutions. He advocates for incentives for companies that invest in workforce training and increased public funding for apprenticeship programs and digital learning platforms. ""No single entity can solve the skills crisis alone,"" he emphasised. ""It will take all of us working together.""",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage.

Scale AI, the AI startup that is a key partner for companies like Meta and xAI, is facing scrutiny after a report revealed that the company has been exposing sensitive client and contractor data through publicly accessible Google Docs . The findings, released by Business Insider, raise serious questions about Scale AI 's security practices and its commitment to client confidentiality .The report uncovered thousands of pages of project documents across 85 individual Google Docs, some containing highly confidential information related to Scale AI's work with major tech clients.These documents included details on how Google utilised ChatGPT to refine its Bard chatbot, as well as at least seven “confidential” instruction manuals from Google outlining issues with Bard and how contractors should address them.For Elon Musk's xAI, public documents revealed specifics of ""Project Xylophone,"" including training materials and 700 conversation prompts aimed at enhancing the AI's conversational abilities on diverse topics.Similarly, Meta training documents, marked confidential, were found publicly accessible, containing links to audio files demonstrating ""good"" and ""bad"" speech prompts for their AI products.Contractors reported that despite attempts at codenaming, it was often easy to identify the client they were working for due to the nature of the tasks or even explicit company logos embedded in presentations. Some even said they could determine the client simply by prompting the AI model directly.Beyond client information, Scale AI also left sensitive personal data belonging to thousands of its contractors exposed in unsecured Google Docs. Spreadsheets, readily viewable by anyone with the URL, listed private Gmail addresses, work performance details, and even categorized some workers as “high quality” or suspected of “cheating.”In response to the publication’s findings, Scale AI stated it takes data security seriously and is investigating the matter.“We are conducting a thorough investigation and have disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale-managed systems,” a spokesperson said.""We remain committed to robust technical and policy safeguards to protect confidential information and are always working to strengthen our practices,"" the spokesperson added.The revelations come on the heels of Meta's blockbuster investment in Scale AI.

From YMCA showers to $300 million exit

Lessons that shaped Elon Musk’s philosophy

Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared a costly lesson from his entrepreneurial beginnings this week, revealing how he lost control of his first company Zip2 despite selling it for $300 million in the late 1990s.Speaking to young founders at Y Combinator 's AI Startup School in San Francisco, Musk identified his critical error: ceding too much control to investors who didn't understand the internet. The mistake haunted what should have been a clear victory for the then-unknown entrepreneur.Musk's journey to Zip2 began with rejection. After Stanford University PhD dropout couldn't land a job at Netscape, his resume apparently never reached Marc Andreessen, he decided to build software himself. ""I'm like man, this is ridiculous, so I'll just write software myself and see how it goes,"" Musk recalled.The early days were brutal. Musk and his co-founder slept in their office and showered at the YMCA to save money. In a desperate move to access internet service, Musk even drilled a hole through the office floor to reach the ISP downstairs.Despite the hardships, Zip2 became a success story, ultimately selling for $300 million. However, Musk's willingness to give investors significant control meant he couldn't steer the company according to his vision for the internet's potential.The experience taught Musk to maintain control of his ventures and ""keep the chips on the table."" He invested nearly all of his $20 million from Zip2 into his next company, X .com, which eventually became part of PayPal Now worth $366 billion according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Musk emphasized to the young entrepreneurs that engineering demands truth while politics creates noise—wisdom earned through hard-fought experience in Silicon Valley's early internet days.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared a costly lesson from his entrepreneurial beginnings this week.

Jason Rugolo , founder of hardware startup Iyo , has responded sharply to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman amid an ongoing trademark lawsuit over the name “io.” Rugolo accused Altman of acting in bad faith after OpenAI announced a hardware venture with Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive , using a name similar to Rugolo’s company. He goes on to say that the reply he received from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was “the worst email I’ve ever received in my professional life.” The comment comes as the two are locked in a legal fight over OpenAI’s use of the name “io” for its AI hardware project with Apple’s former design head Jony Ive.Earlier this month, Iyo sued OpenAI for trademark infringement, alleging that the “io” branding used by Altman and Ive’s new AI hardware project could mislead consumers and harm Iyo’s brand. A federal judge granted Iyo a temporary restraining order on Friday, barring OpenAI from using the name. OpenAI has since removed references to the project from its website.Altman called the lawsuit “silly, disappointing and wrong” in a post on X (formerly Twitter), claiming that Rugolo had pushed for OpenAI to invest in or acquire Iyo, and that the lawsuit followed OpenAI’s refusal.“jason rugolo had been hoping we would invest in or acquire his company iyo and was quite persistent in his effortsWe passed and were clear along the way,” he posted. “Now he is suing OpenAI over the name.

Claimed responsibility for Air India plane crash

Threatened to blow 21 spots in Ahmedabad alone

Acer Swift Neo AI Laptop: Features That Make It Future-Ready!

A 30-year-old robotics engineer from Chennai has been arrested for sending hoax bomb threats across 11 states in an attempt to frame a former colleague who reportedly did not reciprocate her feelings. The accused, Rene Joshlida created multiple fake email IDs, used VPNs and dark webs to stay under the radar for months. As per a police investigation, Joshilda sent fake emails, targeting schools, hospitals, and stadiums in 21 different locations. The techie also sent an email claiming responsibility behind the recent Air India clash in Ahmedabad on June 12 that killed atleast 274. Investigators across states were stumped until a single digital error helped trace the threats back to her.Rene Joshilda is an engineer trained in Robotics. She has been working as a senior consultant at Deloitte in Chennai since 2022. Joshilda met Divij Prabhakar during a project in Bengaluru and fell in love with him. However, the interest was not mutual. Divij did not reciprocate Rene’s feelings and got married to someone else in February this year.Enraged by the rejection, Rene Joshilda allegedly devised an elaborate revenge plan. She created several fake email accounts using variations of Divij Prabhakar’s name and began sending bomb threats to schools, hospitals, and public venues in an attempt to frame him, police investigation said.""When they were working together, she used to create fake email accounts and harass any woman who showed any interest in her secret lover. In one case, she harassed a woman colleague suspecting her to be interested in the male colleague to the extent that she quit her job,"" the police said.The unfortunate Air India plane crash on June 12 killed at least 274 people, including crew members, passengers and civilians on ground. Rene Joshilda, as per police, claimed fake responsibility for the crash. She sent out a hoax email to BJ Medical College administration, saying “I think now you know power. Like we sent you mail yesterday, we crashed the Air India plane with our former CM (Vijay Rupani). We know the police would have thought that the plane crash was a hoax and ignored it. Well done to our pilot. Now you know we are not playing. Now you know.”Using her technical knowledge and expertise, Rene Joshilda used fake email IDs and virtual private networks (VPNs) to send hoax bomb threats. According to Joint CP (Crime) Ahmedabad Sharad Singhal, in the emails – Joshilda threatened to blow up as many as 21 spots in and around Ahmedabad. These included the Narendra Modi stadium in Motera, the Geneva Liberal School in Sarkhej and a civil hospital, among others.Joshilda’s fake bomb threats did not confide to Gujarat alone. As per police, she sent threat emails to 11 states, including Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Bihar, Telangana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Haryana.Police say that Joshilda bought at least 80 numbers through VPN in the past two years and sent hundreds of fake emails. “The number she would use to create email IDs would be virtual. She sent threat emails through Tor browser (a network for anonymous communication) and the Dark Web. She took a lot of precautions. She was very smart and never revealed her digital trail. But she made a small mistake and our cyber crime wing and crime branch tracked her down,” Singhal told the media.She managed to hide her identity and location using the dark web and VPNs, until one time she tipped off her location with a single error. As per an Ahmedabad Mirror report, Joshilda logged into her real and fake email accounts from the same device on one occasion. This helped police in tracing her IP address.

Anthropic wins AI training ruling but must answer for book theft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropic-wins-ai-training-ruling-but-must-answer-for-book-theft/articleshow/122070158.cms,"The court separated how AI companies use books from how they obtain them

Court's ruling could influence similar lawsuits against OpenAI and Meta

A federal judge ruled that Anthropic 's use of copyrighted books to train its Claude chatbot constitutes fair use under copyright law, delivering a significant victory for the AI industry while ordering the company to face trial over acquiring pirated materials.US District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco determined that training AI models on copyrighted works was ""quintessentially transformative"" and legally justified. The ruling dismissed key copyright infringement claims brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who sued Anthropic last year alleging ""large-scale theft"" of their works.Alsup's decision hinged on the transformative nature of AI training, comparing it to ""any reader aspiring to be a writer"" who learns from existing works to create something entirely different. The judge emphasized that Anthropic's large language models didn't reproduce the authors' creative elements or identifiable writing styles, making the training process legally permissible under fair use doctrine.However, the company isn't completely off the hook. Alsup ordered Anthropic to face a December trial over allegations that it illegally downloaded millions of books from online ""shadow libraries"" of pirated copies. Court documents revealed internal employee concerns about using pirate sites before the company shifted strategies.Anthropic later hired former Google Books executive Tom Turvey and began purchasing books in bulk, physically scanning them for AI training.

As we plan to leave the planet early morning of 25 Jun, I wish to thank everyone who has been involved in this mission for their support and also to all the people back home for their blessings and love.

A big thank you to family and friends who have been my bedrock in this journey. Sometimes your close ones make sacrifices that you do not even fully understand but they do so out of their love for you.

Special thanks to @kamnashubha for being the wonderful partner that you are. Without you none of this was possible but more importantly none of this would matter..

No one travels to space alone.. we do so on the shoulders of so many more. I feel grateful to each and every one of you. THANK YOU.

What Lisa Su said about the AI revolution





AMD CEO Lisa Su recently spoke about the impact of AI on hiring. Speaking at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas, US, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su said that artificial intelligence has now slowed down the hiring process at the chipmaker. She emphasised that AMD is actively expanding its workforce and is prioritising the candidates who are ‘AI forward’. “We’re actually not hiring fewer people,” Su told CNBC’s Jon Fortt. “Frankly, we’re growing very significantly as a company, so we actually are hiring lots of people, but we’re hiring different people. We’re hiring people who are AI forward.”AMD is known for designing graphic processing units (GPUs) that help in training AI workloads, placing the company at the center of the global AI race. While, chipset maker Nvidia is dominating the AI chip market presently with more than 90% share, AMD is also aggressively positioning itself as s challenger and is incorporating AI into how it builds, designs, manufactures and tests chips.n Su stressed that candidates who ‘truly embrace’ AI are the ones being prioritised in hiring. This practice reflects on the company’s shift forward embedding AI across its operations.Su also pushed back against the concerns that the adoption of AI could lead to job cuts. Instead she believes that AI helps in increasing productivity. “AI is augmenting our capabilities. It’s not replacing people, it’s actually just augmenting our productivity in terms of the number of products we can bring up at any given time.”As of December 2024, AMD employed roughly 28,000 people worldwide, according to SEC filings. Su said the company continues to grow “very significantly,” underscoring that AI is reshaping the type of talent AMD seeks rather than reducing overall headcount.Last year, Su mentioned that she believes in AGI but not that AI will surpass human intelligence, and she isn’t concerned about doomsday scenarios. She sees technology’s value as dependent on the people who create and guide it, and thinks AI isn’t “great” yet. For her, AI becomes great when it can solve complicated problems. She higlighted that current AI agents mostly handle mundane tasks.“I think there are two directions AI goes. One is pure productivity, you know, how do I remove some of, let’s call it, the menial work that people do, so that they can work on more interesting things? That’s one aspect of it, and we’re using that. But the other aspect of it is when AI can solve really hard problems. It can take what would’ve taken us 10 years to figure out and do that in six months. I think about a world where it normally takes us three years to design a chip, and what does that look like if I could do that in six months?” she added.Comparing the AI revolution with the Internet revolution, Su noted: “The internet is not a bad comparison, but I think AI is much more than the internet. Because, if you think about it, the internet was a lot about moving traffic. AI is more about something foundational in terms of productivity. Sometimes people compare it to the Industrial Revolution, and that’s not a bad comparison, actually.”",Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su said that artificial intelligence has now slowed down the hiring process at the chipmaker.

Meta's most-famous former employee Yann LeCun to everyone in the technology industry: Everything you know about and are working on AI is WRONG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/metas-most-famous-former-employee-yann-lecun-to-everyone-in-the-technology-industry-everything-you-know-about-and-are-working-on-ai-is-wrong/articleshow/126386140.cms,"Meta's former AI chief, Yann LeCun, declared Large Language Models (LLMs) a 'dead end' for achieving superintelligence. He advocates for 'world models' that learn from physical reality, not just language, to build advanced machine intelligence. LeCun's departure from Meta was reportedly due to internal disagreements over the company's LLM-centric superintelligence push, despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg's support for his research.





Meta’s former chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun has a message for everyone in the technology industry: The AI buzzword almost every company believes in-- Large Language Model or LLM -- is a dead-end. In an interview to Financial Times, Lecun said, ""LLMs are useful but fundamentally limited and constrained by language. To achieve human-level intelligence, you have to understand how our physical world works too."" He added that “LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.”This is not the first time that LeCun has spoken against LLMs. The man also known as Godfather of AI has been quite vocal about his disdain for large language models (LLMs) and their potential to reach superhuman intelligence. LeCun's solution for achieving superhuman intelligence relies on an architecture called V-JEPA, a so-called world model. ""World models aim to understand the physical world by learning from videos and spatial data, rather than just language. They are also able to plan, reason and have persistent memory. He calls this kind of intelligence Advanced Machine Intelligence, or AMI,"" he said.Though LeCunn did not clearly say why he left Meta. He did say that staying became politically difficult. Meta's ex-employee said that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg likes his world model research, ""but the crowd who were hired for the company’s new superintelligence push are “completely LLM-pilled”.Here LeCunn meant the team that joined Meta from ScaleAI. In June 2025, Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs. The new AI superintelligence project is led by execs including Scale AI ex-CEO Alexandr Wang. Earlier in June, the company said it would hire Wang, now Meta’s chief AI officer, and some of his colleagues as part of a $14.3 billion investment into Scale AI.Under the restructuring announced by Zuckerberg, LeCun was made to report to Alex Wang. This clearly alienated LeCun. “I’m sure there’s a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,” he says. “But I’m not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I’m wrong. I’m not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this. ”","Yann LeCun, Meta's former AI chief, declared Large Language Models (LLMs) a 'dead end' for achieving superintelligence.

Read AT&T CEO John Stankey's memo to employees here

To: All Employees

I'd like to share some exciting news about the future of AT&T and how we work together.

After nearly a year of consideration, deliberation and planning, we have made the decision to invest in our employee experience and construct a new global headquarters at 5400 Legacy Drive in Plano, Texas.

Spanning across 54 acres of land, this location will provide us with the necessary room to cost effectively consolidate all Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex administrative space, including our three largest locations in Central Dallas, Plano and Irving, and create a corporate campus designed for collaboration, innovation and engagement.

The nature of the company and our work have both evolved significantly since we moved our headquarters to Dallas in 2008, but what hasn't changed is our belief and confidence in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex as the right place to operate a thriving multinational corporation. We are targeting partial occupancy in the new space as early as the second half of 2028.

Over the next few years, we'll be transforming this site from the ground up - demolishing the old buildings and designing a new, modern campus that's built for how we work best: together.

This is an investment intended to put the employee experience at the center of our workspace.

In last year's employee survey, you shared your expectations for professional, well-maintained and functional workspaces. We made a commitment to invest in our workspaces to bring them to a common standard, notably in Atlanta, GA, Chantilly, VA and Bedminster, NJ, to name just a few locations. We will continue to evaluate and invest in our workspaces around the country as our business needs evolve and change.

I am sure this news triggers many questions and natural curiosity for nearly everyone. I am also sure that it will trigger speculation and editorial narrative by those outside the company. I'd ask for patience in getting the answers to your questions and suggest you ignore speculation from uninformed ""sources"" who are not participating in this work.

The planning team intends to share more information in a structured manner in the spring, which is when we will have more definitive answers and executional plans. While the small group of individuals responsible for this effort work to deliver the project on schedule and on budget, I ask that the rest of us continue to focus on delivering for our customers every day. This is just the start, and as this multi-year effort progresses, we promise to keep you informed in a timely manner.

I hope you share my excitement and anticipation for what lies ahead.

John





Telecom giant AT&T has announced that it will relocate its global headquarters from Downtown Dallas to a newly constructed corporate campus in Plano, Texas beginning in 2028.

How to stay safe from WhatsApp Web account renting scam



How the investment scams on matrimonial platforms work



How to stay safe



Verify the person's identity: Do background checks. Use a reverse image search on their photos to see if they are stolen from the internet.

Protect your personal information: Don’t share private personal details, photos, or financial information with anyone you haven’t met in person.

Invest after verification: Do not transfer money to someone online without verifying their identity. If an investment scheme appears too good to be true and providing unrealistic returns in very short span of time, avoid investing money.





The Indian government has issued an advisory warning against two kinds of scams — one is a WhatsApp web account renting scam and other is a type of investment scam happening on matrimonial websites. The advisory has been issued by the National Cybercrime Threat Analytics Unit of Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). According to the advisory, certain Facebook & Instagram accounts are publishing advertisements that claim users can “earn cash automatically” by linking their WhatsApp accounts with their platform. These advertisements redirect users to fraud Web pages or Android mobile applications (.apk) that imitate legitimate earning platforms.On the other hand, fraudsters are also creating fake profiles on matrimonial platforms like Jeevansaathi.com, Shaadi.com, Matrimony.com etc. or dating platforms (Tinder, Bumble, Ok Cupid etc.) to emotionally deceive and financially exploit individuals who are genuinely seeking relationships or marriage.The National Cybercrime Threat Analytics Unit of I4C has identified an emerging transnational crime trend where certain Facebook & Instagram accounts are publishing advertisements that claim users can “earn cash automatically” by linking their WhatsApp accounts with their platform. These advertisementsredirect users to fraud Web pages or Android mobile applications (.apk) that imitate legitimate earning platforms.Unsuspecting individuals are lured by promises of high commissions and passive income, and are instructed to connect their WhatsApp accounts through QR codes.This campaign is orchestrated by threat actors to exploit WhatsApp’s linked device feature which allows web based access to WhatsApp. Such accounts are effectively being rented out as “mule WhatsApp accounts”, which may subsequently be used for illegal activities such as fraud, scams, or dissemination of malicious content.The advisory lists some of the precautionary steps that can be taken to avoid online frauds like USSD-based call forwarding scams. These are:• Renting WhatsApp account and receiving illicit funds can lead to legal consequences, including arrest.• Avoid installing APKs from unknown sources.• Be cautious of Meta Ads that promise quick income, referral commissions, or automatic cash earnings (specially related to stock market investment).• Periodically check for suspicious devices linked to your WhatsApp by navigating to Linked Devices.National Cybercrime Threat Analytics Unit of I4C has identified a rise in misuse of matrimony platforms leading to investment scams. Based on NCRP complaint analysis, it was observed that fraudsters are creating fake profiles on matrimonial platforms like Jeevansaathi.com, Shaadi.com, Matrimony.com etc. or dating platforms (Tinder, Bumble, Ok Cupid etc.) to emotionally deceive and financially exploit individuals who are genuinely seeking relationships or marriage.The advisory issued by MHA has also listed some precautionary measures which will help individuals from getting scammed:",The Indian government has issued an advisory warning against two kinds of scams.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is impressed by the Chinese company that made Nvidia 'poorer' by $580 billion in one single day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-is-impressed-by-the-chinese-company-that-made-nvidia-poorer-by-580-billion-in-one-single-day/articleshow/126372898.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang lauded Chinese AI startup DeepSeek for its role in advancing open-source AI, despite its model causing a massive market value drop. Huang highlighted DeepSeek's efficient use of older chips, proving AI breakthroughs don't solely depend on cutting-edge hardware. Nvidia, meanwhile, is pushing forward with its powerful new Vera Rubin platform, anticipating continued growth in AI infrastructure.

Jensen Huang says DeepSeek turbocharged the open-source movement

Nvidia bets big on next-generation chips





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has nothing but admiration for DeepSeek—the Chinese AI startup that wiped nearly $600 billion off his company's market value in a single day last January.Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 5, Huang credited DeepSeek with ""activating"" a global shift toward open-source artificial intelligence, calling the company's work ""really, really exciting"" and saying Nvidia was ""so happy with it. ""The praise comes almost a year after DeepSeek's R1 model sparked panic among investors in January 2025. The Chinese startup claimed it had developed a competitive AI model using just 2,048 of Nvidia's older H800 chips—costing under $6 million and taking only two months. By comparison, US companies were spending tens of millions on thousands of Nvidia's most advanced chips for similar results.The news triggered a bloodbath on Wall Street. Nvidia's stock crashed 17% on January 27, 2025, and the chipmaker lost roughly $593 billion—a record-breaking single-day loss for any US company. The sell-off rippled across the tech sector, with chip stocks and AI-related companies plummeting as investors suddenly questioned whether Big Tech's massive AI spending spree made sense anymore.But Huang has consistently defended DeepSeek's achievements, arguing the market got it wrong. At CES 2026, he doubled down on that position, saying DeepSeek's R1 model ""caught the world by surprise"" and was helping revolutionize AI development globally.""We saw the advance of DeepSeek R1, the first open model that's a reasoning system,"" Huang told the audience. He emphasized that open-source models were rapidly closing the performance gap with proprietary ""frontier"" models from companies like OpenAI and Google Huang highlighted that Chinese developers—working under US chip export restrictions—had proven that AI breakthroughs don't necessarily require unlimited computing resources. DeepSeek had stockpiled H800, a rather older generation of chips, before a 2023 US export ban, showing that smart engineering could compensate for hardware limitations.In the aftermath of last January's market chaos, Huang had argued that DeepSeek's reasoning models would actually require ""100 times more computing"" than non-reasoning AI, suggesting increased chip demand ahead. But DeepSeek appears determined to prove otherwise. The startup kicked off 2026 with a technical paper proposing a rethink of fundamental AI training architecture—a method called Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections aimed at making models even more cost-effective while keeping pace with better-funded US rivals.Despite the DeepSeek disruption, Nvidia remains bullish about AI's future. At CES, Huang unveiled the company's next-generation Vera Rubin platform, which he said would deliver five times the computing power of previous products and is now in ""full production.""The new flagship servers will contain 72 graphics processing units and 36 central processing units, capable of linking into ""pods"" with over 1,000 Rubin chips. Huang said demand from Chinese customers for Nvidia's H200 chips remains ""strong,"" even as the company navigates US export controls.Nvidia's stock has largely recovered from the January selloff, validating Huang's long-term view that AI infrastructure spending will continue growing regardless of efficiency breakthroughs.","Jensen Huang says DeepSeek's R1 model ""caught the world by surprise"" The Chinese startup claimed it had developed a competitive AI model using just 2,048 of Nvidia's older H800 chips.

This comes as Zoho shelved its $700 million chipmaking plan due to tech confidence issues. Meanwhile, India is aggressively pursuing semiconductor manufacturing, aiming for global parity by 2032 with significant government backing and industry participation.

Zoho had to suspend its $700 million chipmaking plan over technology concerns

Government accelerates semiconductor manufacturing ambitions





Zoho co-founder and chief scientist Sridhar Vembu has outlined the two fundamental approaches to engineering research and development, emphasizing that both require different levels of patience and commitment. In a recent post on X, Vembu explained that R&D work falls into two distinct categories: catching up with existing state-of-the-art technology and advancing beyond current capabilities.""Catching up is generally easier than advancing the state of the art, but depending on the technology—as an example 3 nm fab or advanced jet engines—even that can be extremely hard,"" Vembu wrote. He noted that while advancing technology is generally harder, unexplored areas can offer opportunities for easier progress.Vembu stressed the need for sustained investment in both approaches. ""We have to invest in both but we have to understand the difficulty level and adjust our patience level accordingly. We need the talent and money but we also need the patience to stay the course,"" he said.Vembu's reflections on engineering R&D could possibly be related to Zoho's decision to suspend its $700 million chipmaking plan. The software company put its year-long effort on hold in May 2025, with Vembu explaining the decision centered on technology confidence.""Wedid not have that confidence in the tech so our board decided to shelve this idea for the time being, until we find a better tech approach,"" Vembu said. Given the capital-intensive nature of semiconductor manufacturing requiring government backing, the company wanted absolute certainty before accepting taxpayer money.Zoho had planned to invest $400 million in a semiconductor facility in Karnataka, creating 460 jobs. The company's subsidiary, Silectric Semiconductor Manufacturing, had made limited hires and formed a board. Reuters reported the company encountered challenges in finding suitable technology partners for the complex chipmaking processesMeanwhile, government is moving ahead with its plans in the semiconductor space. In the New Economy Forum, hosted by Bloomberg, the technology minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said the plan is for the country’s semiconductors to be on par with the most advanced manufacturers by 2032, with three of the new fabs set to begin their commercial production operations early next year.To facilitate this plan, the government has launched a subsidy-based wafer with a total Corpus Fund of $10 billion. This has led to many companies participating in this initiative, including Micron Technology and Tata Group . This same technique was used when India succeeded in encouraging Apple and its manufacturers to make iPhones in India.","Zoho had to suspend its $700 million chipmaking plan over technology concerns.

Packed with sensors and speakers, it brings sets to life with interactive sound and light effects. Launching in March with three Star Wars sets, these bricks wirelessly charge and connect via Bluetooth, promising an immersive building experience.

Three Star Wars sets with Smart Brick coming this March





Lego has shown off its most tech-packed brick yet at CES 2026—a 2x4 smart brick crammed with sensors, speakers, and LED lights that brings sets to life through sound effects and interactive features. The company calls it ""the most significant evolution in the Lego System-in-Play since the introduction of the Lego Minifigure in 1978."" But, there's no AI in them—if you were wondering.The Smart Brick houses a custom chip smaller than a Lego stud and includes accelerometers, light sensors, motion detection, and a built-in synthesizer. There's a built-in microphone that Lego says won't be recording. Instead, it acts as a virtual button, detecting sound inputs like blowing on a birthday cake.Unlike previous Lego Mario sets that required AAA batteries, it wirelessly charges on a shared pad and can last years without use. There's no need to scan barcodes, too, since the brick connects via Bluetooth mesh network to other Smart Bricks nearby, letting them recognize each other's position and orientation in 3D space.The Smart Bricks will make their debut later this year in March with three Star Wars sets ranging from $70 to $160.Each includes Smart Bricks along with NFC-equipped Smart Tags (special tiles) and Smart Minifigures that activate different sounds and lights when brought near the brick.The $70 Darth Vader TIE Fighter (473 pieces) includes one Smart Brick, one tag, and one smart minifigure. Luke's Red Five X-Wing costs $100 for 584 pieces with one brick, five tags, and two smart figures. The $160 Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set packs 962 pieces, two bricks, five tags, and three smart minifigures.These smart Star Wars sets can make lightsaber humming sounds, roaring ship engines, blaster effects, and even play ""The Imperial March"" when Emperor Palpatine sits on his throne. Ships can battle each other with sound effects, while built-in sensors detect gestures like shaking or tipping over.Lego plans to expand Smart Play beyond Star Wars, and Pokémon sets could be next.","Lego unveils Smart Brick at CES 2026.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s prediction

Elon Musk on Nvidia’s self‑driving push





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now shared his opinion on Nvidia’s newly unveiled Vera Rubin chips the company showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026. Musk acknowledged the impressive design and performance of the chips, but predicted that the technology would take ‘another nine months’ before becoming operational at scale. The comments made by Musk came in response to a video shared by influencer Sawyer Merritt. The video shared highlighted the architecture and capabilities of the new Nvidia chip.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Rubin chips as the successor to the Blackwell architecture. Huang claimed that the Rubin chips will offer five times more performance. Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s first six-chip AI platform developed using an “extreme codesign” approach, where multiple components are designed together. The platform includes Rubin GPUs, Vera CPUs, NVLink 6 networking, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics, ConnectX-9 networking cards and BlueField-4 data processing units. Nvidia said this design helps reduce bottlenecks and improve performance for large AI workloads.The Rubin GPU delivers up to 50 petaflops of inference performance using NVFP4 precision. The Vera CPU is designed to handle data movement and AI agent processing tasks.Nvidia said the platform is built to support large-scale AI training and inference more efficiently.Despite all the hype around the latest Nvidia chipset, Musk has raised caution that scaling Rubin chips would take time. “It will take another nine months before the technology becomes operational at scale and the software can function smoothly,” he wrote on X.The remarks made by Musk suggest that while Nvidia’s hardware leap is significant, the ecosystem around it — including software optimization and deployment — will require months of refinement before widespread adoption.Nvidia also unveiled Alpamayo, its new self‑driving technology built on a vision‑language‑action model, which Huang described as the “ChatGPT moment” for autonomous driving. Musk, however, expressed skepticism, noting that distribution of such technology would be “super hard” to solve. Tesla’s AI chief Ashok Elluswamy echoed Musk’s concerns, though Musk ultimately wished Nvidia success in advancing self‑driving systems.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared his opinion on Nvidia’s newly unveiled Vera Rubin chips the company showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026.

LG CLOiD home robot: “Zero Labor Home” goes hands-on

LG OLED evo W6: the Wallpaper TV returns—now “True Wireless”





Las Vegas: From an AI beauty mirror that reads “invisible” skin conditions to a see-through Micro LED screen that looks like glass, Samsung used CES 2026’s stage to pitch a home where displays, sensors and voice controls quietly take over the daily admin. LG, meanwhile, brought robotics and ultra-thin OLED back into the spotlight—promising a “Zero Labor Home” with a working home robot, and reviving its Wallpaper TV concept with true wireless connectivity.Samsung’s AI Beauty Mirror is positioned as an “intelligent personal beauty platform” that analyzes even “the invisible conditions of your skin.” Built around a hybrid mirror display, sensors and on-device AI, it combines a polarized mirror and a half mirror, and uses multi-spectrum skin analysis based on RGB, UV and polarization to generate tailored skincare recommendations.In the demo, the mirror integrates AMOREPACIFIC’s research expertise to assess skin condition and recommend personalized skincare products. It also offers personal color recommendations powered by TWINIT’s AI engine, analyzing “skin tone, eyes, and lips” to create a palette aimed at more confident styling.SmartThings Pet Care adds a Pet Disease Detection feature that uses AI Vision to analyze photos for conditions including dental issues, patellar luxation and cataracts.The flow is designed to be simple: follow on-screen guidance, capture images of a dog with a mobile device, and AI Vision returns results “in just three seconds.”Samsung says the system draws on a database of more than 10,000 cases, delivering data-driven insights along with results on potential abnormalities and related care or treatment information. A separate description of the service says it was trained on “over 30,000 cases” to help spot issues early by photographing a specific body part.Samsung’s Transparent Micro LED pitch leaned on flexibility and aesthetics: “design flexibility without size constraints,” a “true glass-like appearance,” high transparency and “outstanding image clarity.” The company says it reaches high brightness without a rear light-blocking structure—framing it as a step beyond conventional transparent displays.Samsung also claims higher maximum brightness than traditional transparent OLEDs for clearer viewing, while positioning the panel as a new kind of display that can adapt across user environments and expand to home use. In its First Look messaging, Samsung highlighted “Transmittance” and “Clarity,” saying Micro LED brightness increases light transmission by creating larger open areas on each pixel, and that it offers “twice the clarity of OLED. ”Samsung’s Art Store proposition is straightforward: transform an “Art TV” into a décor centerpiece with “thousands of curated artworks” from leading museums, galleries and artists—spanning classics, modern masters and contemporary icons. The list namechecks Belvedere, Liberty, Musée d’Orsay, MFA Boston, Tate, The Met, Centre Pompidou, MoMA, VOGUE and marimekko.The service is framed as available across The Frame, QLED, Micro RGB and OLED—positioned as a single library that extends Samsung’s “living with art” story beyond one product line and across premium panels.Samsung’s The Frame Pro focus is on cleaner installation and “gallery-like” picture tuning. The headline feature is “Wireless One Connect,” which Samsung says enables flexible installation and a cleaner setup using Wi-Fi 7 and Samsung’s high compression codec.On picture quality, the company touts “Artful picture quality with Neo QLED” for a gallery-like viewing experience, and “Sharper detail with glare free,” describing enhanced reflection control and clarity to make art and imagery sit more naturally in bright rooms.Samsung says its AI features can monitor and manage home security while users are away, analyzing video and audio from connected home devices and providing a briefing of events via the Now Brief screen on mobile devices, TVs and refrigerators.Vision AI, Samsung adds, summarizes and notifies key events from security cameras—such as unfamiliar visitor activity or package deliveries. For longer absences, users can create an Away Mode by voice command, including: ‘Make it look like someone is home’. Samsung says an LLM analyzes the request and suggests routines to mimic an occupied home.LG Electronics says it will publicly demonstrate LG CLOiD™, an AI-enabled home robot, at CES 2026 as part of its “Zero Labor Home” vision. CLOiD is designed to perform and coordinate household tasks across connected appliances, integrating with LG’s ThinQ ecosystem and building on the Self-Driving AI Home Hub (LG Q9).LG’s demo scenarios include the robot retrieving milk from a refrigerator, placing a croissant into an oven, initiating laundry cycles after occupants leave, and folding and stacking garments after drying. LG describes a head, torso with two articulated arms and a wheeled base, with seven degrees of freedom per arm and five independently actuated fingers for fine manipulation.LG frames CLOiD’s core intelligence as “Physical AI,” combining a Vision Language Model (VLM) that converts images/video into structured language-based understanding, and Vision Language Action (VLA) that translates visual and verbal inputs into physical actions.LG says these models were trained on “tens of thousands of hours” of household task data to recognize appliances, interpret user intent and execute actions such as opening doors or transferring objectsLG Home Appliance Solution Company president Steve Baek said: “The LG CLOiD home robot is designed to naturally engage with and understand the humans it serves, providing an optimized level of household help.”LG’s 2026 OLED lineup is headlined by the LG OLED evo W6, True Wireless Wallpaper TV, reviving the Wallpaper Design first introduced in 2017. LG says the W6 has a “nine-millimeter-class thin body,” achieved through component miniaturization and a re-engineered internal architecture, paired with an improved wall mount so the TV sits flush “from edge to edge.”Connectivity shifts to a Zero Connect Box—placing inputs up to 10 meters away—supporting what LG calls “visually lossless” 4K video and audio wirelessly. LG positions it as the “world’s thinnest True Wireless OLED TV,” pairing form-factor minimalism with flagship picture ambitions.","Samsung's AI Beauty Mirror analyzes even “the invisible conditions of your skin.” SmartThings Pet Care adds a Pet Disease Detection feature that uses AI Vision to analyze photos for conditions including dental issues, patellar luxation and cataracts.

Wipro tightens work-from-office policy; HR sends email with 'clarification' on minimum time employees must work from office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/wipro-tightens-work-from-office-policy-hr-sends-email-with-clarification-on-minimum-time-employees-must-work-from-office/articleshow/126368751.cms,"Wipro revises extra 30 days remote work facility







Software giant Wipro has reportedly tightened its work-from-office policy. According to a report in Economic Times, the company has mandated at least six hours in office for three days a week. This is a shift from the earlier flexible hours. Wipro made weekly three days of attendance at the office compulsory some time back. What has changed is the six hours of mandatory stay between two in and out punches. Wipro HR reportedly sent employees an email regarding the change in the company's Hybrid work policy that went into effect starting January 1.Announcing the changes to its policy, Wipro reportedly said in a recent email to employees that hybrid working continued to be the cornerstone of the future of work. “We trust all associates will follow the policy in both letter and spirit as it supports collaboration across teams while providing flexibility,” it said.The email at the same time also clarified that six hours is the minimum time that employees must work from the office, and that six hours is not the total daily working hours, which remain 9.5 hours. It further said that employees must complete the remaining working hours from home on the same day and complete the assigned work.According to the report, the new system will impact employees' leave balance if they fall short of their weekly work-from-office mandate. In addition, if employees spend less than six hours in the office, then they will face a half day’s cut in their leave.In October 2024, Wipro Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil announced the company's ""new hybrid work policy"" that required employees to work from the office three days a week, with the option to seek remote working for specific days in a year. As per this policy, employees could have an extra 30 days of remote work facility in a calendar year on two conditions: One, 15 days in case of employees not being well; Two, 15 days for care giving in case someone in the family is unwell.As per the Hybrid work policy that went into effect on January 1 this year, the number of days have been reduced to 12 from the earlier 15 days in a calendar year.Govil also wrote a post on LinkedIn on the policy. ""I am proud to share with you the new hybrid work policy we have recently introduced. At Wipro, we have taken a modern approach to the future of work -one that focuses equally on well-being of our associates while being a high performing culture, driven by collaboration,"" wrote Govil.",Wipro has reportedly tightened its work-from-office policy. The company has mandated at least six hours in office for three days a week. This is a shift from the earlier flexible hours.

Why engineering-first leaders are taking over India’s GCCs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-engineering-first-leaders-are-taking-over-indias-gccs/articleshow/126367334.cms,"



With technology at the helm, global capability centre (GCC) leaders are rewriting leadership slates, prioritising site leaders with a deep engineering focus. In the India business case, the mandate moved well beyond setting up a sourcing base, liaising with headquarters, or acting as a talent scout, to demonstrating strong engineering leadership and rapid adoption of AI playbooks.As advisory firms increasingly take on the archetypes of erstwhile India leadership roles, GCC heads are being pushed to demonstrate deeper technology ownership to raise the bar within their parent firms and across client ecosystems. Leadership expectations shifted decisively from operational oversight to owning global technology outcomes. Last year marked an inflection point for GCCs, with over 2 dozen leaders appointed during the period. Several executives moved to new firms as part of broader leadership reshuffles and mandate changes, reflecting rising expectations and a growing willingness among global firms to reset leadership quickly.Pradeep Menon moved from his role as CEO and country head of HSBC SDI, where he also served as managing director and head of technology for India, to take over as country head and MD of Charles Schwab India. Satya Prakash Ranjan was appointed country head of technology at First Citizens India, part of US-based First Citizens Bank, a top-20 US financial institution with assets exceeding $200 billion.Prashanti Bodugum joined as head of Evernorth Health Services India, moving from Walmart Global Tech India, where she served as Vice President for e-commerce US omni platforms technology for its India operations.Lalit Ahuja, founder of ANSR, said as GCCs assume larger product, platform, and engineering mandates, leaders are increasingly appointed based on the specific business and engineering outcomes they are expected to deliver—whether in digital transformation, AI, cloud, cybersecurity, or emerging technologies. “Today, site leaders spend nearly 80% of their time operating in global functional roles, with only about 20% focused on traditional site responsibilities such as brand building, culture, and ecosystem engagement. This marks a significant departure from the past, when site leaders were largely administrative heads. Today, GCC leaders are domain experts and strategic partners, deeply embedded in enterprise priorities and accountable for key business-critical mandates.” Ahuja said site leaders spend nearly 80% of their time operating in global functional roles, with only about 20% focused on traditional site responsibilities such as brand building, culture, and ecosystem engagement.Venkat Shastry, founder and CEO of leadership advisory firm QuantumV, said GCCs are no longer judged as cost or delivery centres but are increasingly measured as product, platform and IP engines. “Boards have dramatically shortened their patience cycles. If a GCC leader can’t articulate an AI-led transformation and operating model within 6–12 months, companies are far quicker today to reset leadership than they were even two years ago. India’s GCC ecosystem has matured to the point where leadership replacement feels lower risk. With a deep bench of experienced leaders, companies believe they can ‘upgrade’ leadership fast—and that confidence itself is accelerating movement.Arindam Sen, GCC partner at EY India, said the rise in leadership roles at GCCs reflects natural career progression and capability. “It also reflects a shift from traditional, execution-led leadership archetypes to more globally embedded, advisory-driven ones. This shift requires a new league of leaders—who combine strategic thinking, business insight, and execution excellence, qualities that India’s talent is uniquely demonstrating. ”Pari Natarajan, CEO of global management consultancy firm Zinnov, said shifts are being accelerated by GenAI. As automation takes over routine execution, enterprises are becoming more deliberate about where engineering judgement, product ownership, and architectural decisions sit. Increasingly, that work is moving into GCCs, raising the leadership bar. “We’ve seen centres once measured on headcount and SLAs now being asked to own global engineering roadmaps or AI platforms with direct business impact. When the mandate changes that fundamentally, leadership change is often a consequence of evolution, not a response to failure.”","Global capability centre (GCC) leaders are rewriting leadership slates, prioritising site leaders with a deep engineering focus.

Deutsche Bank analysts' warning on AI spend





Global stock markets, riding high on AI euphoria at the start of 2026 may be disregarding one of the biggest threats: A surge in inflation driven partly by the tech investment boom; warn analysts. According to a report in Reuters, the US stock indexes, where seven biggest technology companies (called Magnificent Seven) made double-digit gains in 2025 to hit record highs as exuberance about AI. For those unaware, the Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of high-performing and influential companies in the US stock market: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia. In the world of finance, the Magnificent Seven are a group of seven high-performing, influential stocks in the technology sector. The name comes from a 1960 John Sturges Western film, “The Magnificent Seven,” depicting a powerful group of seven gunmen.Analysts are reportedly worried that multi-trillion-dollar race by so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet to build new data centres is an inflationary force, because of the rate at which these projects are gobbling up energy and advanced chips. ""The costs are going up not down in our forecast, because there's inflation in chip costs and inflation in power costs,"" Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets told Reuters.In fact, the stock markets have already shown some early signs of nerves about rising costs and potential AI over-spending.Deutsche Bank sees the scale of capital expenditure (capex) investment going into AI as gargantuan. The Bank expects AI data-centre capital expenditure to reach as much as $4 trillion by 2030 and the rapid rollout of these projects could cause supply bottlenecks in chips and electricity that make investment costs spiral, the bank's analysts warned. According to Deutsche Bank, hyperscalers cumulative spend of $4 trillion on AI data centers through 2030 is more than the U.S. government’s moon-landing program in the 1960s: “10x [the] inflation-adjusted cost of Apollo programme with no guaranteed return.""You need a pin that pricks the bubble and it will probably come through tighter money,"" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management. He said that while he was holding on to big tech stocks for now he would not be surprised to see inflation booming worldwide by the end of 2026.","Deutsche Bank sees the scale of capital expenditure (capex) investment going into AI as gargantuan.

Microsoft Edge adopts Copilot's design language in major UI overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-edge-adopts-copilots-design-language-in-major-ui-overhaul/articleshow/126359078.cms,"Microsoft is giving its Edge browser a significant visual overhaul, adopting the sleek design of its Copilot AI. This refresh, currently in testing, brings rounded corners and new color schemes across the browser's interface. This move signals a broader push for a unified, AI-driven look across Microsoft's services, aiming to integrate experiences rather than launch entirely new ones.

A unified look across Microsoft's AI tools





Microsoft is rolling out a visual refresh for its Edge browser, borrowing heavily from the design language of its Copilot AI assistant. The changes are currently being tested in early Canary and Dev channel builds, marking what could be the beginning of a broader design shift across Microsoft's product lineup.The redesign touches nearly every part of the browser interface. The new tab page, settings menu, context menus, and dropdown elements all now feature the rounded corners, color schemes, and typography that debuted with the Copilot app. According to Windows Central, these changes appear regardless of whether users have Copilot Mode enabled, though the new tab page adapts based on the setting.This move represents a departure from Microsoft's established Fluent Design system, which currently powers Windows 11, Xbox, and Office. The Copilot design language originally emerged after most of the Inflection AI team joined Microsoft in 2024, bearing striking similarities to the Pi AI assistant Inflection had developed.Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman confirmed last year that the company plans to evolve Edge rather than create an entirely new AI-focused browser. ""There isn't going to be a new browser; this is just going to be one experience,"" Suleyman told The Verge's Tom Warren.The Edge browser is not the only interface being reworked. In addition, Microsoft is also exploring the use of its copilot design language Copilot Discover, which is an AI-driven version of the MSN.com site. Although the new look has not been implemented in Windows or Xbox, the overall trend here is towards a unified look for its services, which is AI-driven.The new interface is currently in the preview stage, and it will probably be several weeks before it makes it to the stable version of the Edge browser.","Microsoft is rolling out a visual refresh for its Edge browser, borrowing heavily from the design language of its Copilot AI assistant.

Skyscanner has these three 'tips' for you to buy cheap air tickets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/skyscanner-has-these-three-tips-for-you-to-buy-cheap-air-tickets/articleshow/126355672.cms,"Tip 1: Know where it's cheapest to go

Tip 2: Become a pro in tracking prices

Search for a flight in the Skyscanner app

Tap the heart icon to save your favourite flights.

Tip 3: Compare prices in a single view

""Cheapest Month""

""Whole Month""

""Flexible dates""





Flight prices can feel like a guessing game. One day a ticket costs one amount, the next day it's completely different. Many travelers end up spending more than they need to simply because they don't know when to book or where to look for deals. This is especially frustrating when you're trying to stick to a travel budget but still want to explore new places. Rather than endlessly searching different dates and destinations hoping to stumble upon a good deal, consider using tools that do the hard work for you.Skyscanner, which is a popular flight aggregator service, offers multiple useful tools that can help you find the cheapest air tickets without the hassle. These tools are designed to save you time and money and can be used by users if they're flexible about their destination, travel dates, or both. Here's everything you need to know about finding affordable flights using Skyscanner's three key tips.One of the biggest barriers to finding cheap flights is being locked into a specific destination. Skyscanner's ""Explore Everywhere"" feature solves this by letting you search for ""Everywhere"" rather than a particular city.The tool shows all places you can fly to from your airport, organised by price from cheapest to most expensive.To use the feature, users can visit Skyscanner’s website or app and enter their departure city. They can then select “Everywhere” as the destination and choose travel dates or pick the “Cheapest month” option if their plans are flexible. Skyscanner will show users destination results sorted by price, with filters available for direct flights, specific airlines, or regions. This can be a useful one for travellers who want the best deals and are open to different destinations.As flight prices change often, checking them every day can be time-consuming. To solve this issue, Skyscanner offers tools like Price Alerts and the Saved Feature. These tools help users to track fares automatically.The Saved feature works like a travel wishlist. This feature allows users to save flights and organise them into lists. Meanwhile, the ‘Price Alerts’ feature monitor these saved flights and notify users when prices change.Users who want to set up this feature will need to follow these steps:Once this feature is set up, it will make it easier for users to book at the right time without constantly checking flight ticket prices.One thing that matters the most while booking flights is the timing. Skyscanner's flexible dates feature shows prices for different days or months in one calendar view. This includes options such as thefeature, which identifies the month that has the lowest prices overall, while thetool provides day-by-day pricing for your chosen month.To use this feature, users have to enter their cities, click, and choose their preferred option. Once it's set up, users can review the grid showing the lowest recent fares and select dates that fit your budget. Both features work on Skyscanner’s desktop site and mobile app.The prices shown are estimates based on recent searches and can change quickly, so book soon when you find a good deal.

Elon Musk has recently focused attention on the AI tool for the creation of images and videos by xAI’s Grok Imagine, with a thread about guidelines for the creation of aesthetically attractive and cinematic content. Elon Musk recently posted a thread that directed attention to a guiding article by AI enthusiast @karatademada with instructions and explanations that highlight the effectiveness of storytelling in improving the output of AI-generated media. Unlike common AI tools for the creation of images that depend on the description of an object, Grok AI is highly successful with descriptions that focus on emotion, ambience, lighting, and camera angles, according to the article posted by Elon Musk.Grok Imagine is an AI-powered creative tool designed to help users generate cinematic-quality images and videos from simple text prompts. By combining advanced image generation with dynamic visual styling, it allows creators to experiment with lighting, composition, and motion without technical expertise.Users of Grok Imagine are taught one of the most important lessons in moving away from simple, descriptive prompts.Instead of writing, ""A woman walking on a street,"" for instance, they should be thinking about how to direct the scene: ""Cinematic shot of a woman walking alone on a rainy Paris street at night, reflections of neon lights on wet pavement, filmed in 4K, directed by Christopher Nolan, atmospheric and moody. "" By setting the mood and style, users really let the AI interpret the story behind an image rather than just objects in their own space.Grok Imagine does well with emotional context. Instead of ""A happy girl under the sun,"" a more illustrative and emotionally evocative prompt would be: “Close-up of a carefree young woman laughing under golden sunlight, wind blowing through her hair, summer energy, cinematic lens flare, warm tone."" By including how it should make the viewer feel in the image, the AI can create compositions that really carry emotional depth and engagement, making them appear much more lifelike and compelling.Camera perspective and cinematography terms are critical for creating dramatic scenes. Users are capable of defining a wide establishing shot, a low-angle shot, or a close-up shot. These definitions include: “Wide establishing shot of a futuristic city skyline at dawn, soft mist, glowing reflections on glass towers, slow camera pan,” or “Low-angle cinematic shot of a hero standing on a rooftop, coat flapping, sun behind silhouette. ” These descriptive terms enable Grok Imagine to render scenes with a cinematic perspective.The following five aspects must be involved within the prompt for high-quality results to be achieved consistently:By dissecting the prompt into these elements, it becomes certain that the AI will comprehend the entire scene and generate images that correspond to the user’s vision.Grok Imagine allows the refinement of images in increments. New scenes can be improved or changed by stating the additional elements: Same picture, but include soft morning sunlight filtering through the window, a cup of cappuccino on the table, and the Paris skyline reflected in the glass. In much larger ways, complete scene transformation is also accomplished: Change the same scene into a cyber café scene in the future, a place of holographic menus and digital rain.The creation of better AI-generated images is an iterative process. Users can take the advice offered to improve their prompts through the use of language, style, and composition. An example would be to take a basic prompt, Portrait of a woman holding flowers,"" and improve it in the following manner: Cinematic portrait of a woman holding yellow tulips; soft focus; 85mm lens; soft morning light.","Elon Musk recently posted an article about how to use Grok Imagine to create cinematic AI images and videos.

A militant group named the Vulkangruppe has claimed responsibility for an arson attack that disrupted power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Germany. In a 2,500-word protest letter, the group stated the act was a protest against the climate crisis and the role of artificial intelligence (AI). The attack, which occurred last week on a bridge crossing the Teltow canal, damaged high-voltage cables near the Lichterfelde heat and power station in Berlin.Stromnetz Berlin, the city's grid operator, reported that 35,000 households and 1,900 businesses may be without electricity and heat until January 8. According to a report by The Guardian, the group wrote that they specifically chose to target"" German state security authorities have opened an investigation into the incident. The Vulkangruppe's letter links their actions to broader concerns about digital infrastructure and environmental impact.In a 2,500-word letter seen by the Guardian that police calledthe group said it wanted toIt criticised amade from dirty fossil fuels, calling the attackand anIn the letter, which included details about the fire, Vulkangruppe said that data centres used for AI were worsening the problem of climate-harming energy use while posing dangers to society.the group noted.The group also added that it was sorry for poorer people who lost power because of the attack but claimed that it had less sympathynow in the dark.The area that lost power includes many nursing homes and hospitals, as well as tall buildings with people who need elevators that are now out of service. Berlin had some snow over the weekend, and temperatures dropped well below freezing at night.Berlin's mayor, Kai Wegner, said that he believed the massive blackout was done for political reasons, while security experts said it looked like a previous far-left attack.Wegner told reporters during a visit to an emergency shelter for those without heat and hot water.With cell phone networks down, police used loudspeakers on their cars to tell people what was happening as they helped those who needed care. Several local train lines stopped running, and many students who were supposed to return to school this week may see their break extended into next week.A previous arson attack blamed on the far left in September 2025 knocked out power for 60 hours in the southeast part of the city in what was reportedly Berlin's most extended power cut since World War II.Early guesses for the weekend blackout had included possible Russian sabotage, as Germany has been closely watching for attacks on its infrastructure by other countries.In March 2024, Vulkangruppe claimed an arson attack against a power tower at the Tesla gigafactory outside Berlin that cut off electricity to the plant and temporarily stopped production.In its 2024 annual security report, Germany's domestic intelligence watchdog mentioned repeated attacks on the local power grid by Vulkangruppe, which it labels as a left-wing extremist group.It said the group, believed to be about 14 years old, chose targets for their, intending to cause destruction requiring painstaking and lengthy repairs with little concern for collateral damage.Stromnetz Berlin said that at first, 45,000 homes and 2,200 businesses in the districts of Nikolassee, Zehlendorf, Wannsee and Lichterfelde lost power starting last week. A day later, the company said on its website that about 10,000 homes and 300 businesses in Lichterfelde had had their electricity restored.But cold weather was making it harder to lay new underground cables, meaning the remaining homes may have to wait until later this week to get their lights and heat back on.Stromnetz Berlin noted.Experts said attacks on energy infrastructure required little specialist knowledge to have a significant impact, with maps showing key parts of the power grid widely available online and few backup plans ready to use in the event of sabotage.","The far-left group Vulkangruppe has claimed responsibility for an arson attack that disrupted power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Germany.

“A colleague of mine who used to work in product support told me that they had a procedure if a customer became irate and demanded to speak with Bill Gates. (This was, of course, back in the days when Bill Gates still ran the company.)

The product support technician would apologise for not resolving the problem to the customer’s satisfaction, but if the customer continued to demand to speak with The Boss, the technician would indeed transfer the customer.

The customer was transferred to a special internal phone number, and when the operators saw a call on that line, they took the call and said, “Bill Gates’s office.” They weren’t actually in Bill Gates’s office. They were just pretending to be Bill Gates’s secretary. Their job was to tell the caller that Mr. Gates is currently unavailable, but if the customer leaves a message and their contact information, they will pass the information to Mr. Gates.

Of course, I assume¹ the information was never actually passed along to Bill. The information went back into the product support channel with a note that the customer was escalated to “Bill Gates’s office.” The technician who returned the call would probably say something like “Bill Gates asked me to contact you to follow up on an issue you had earlier.”

Maybe Bill got a copy or a summary of these messages, I don’t know.”





Microsoft had a specific method for handling angry customers who demanded to speak with Bill Gates . According to veteran Microsoft engineer Raymond Chen, the company used to transfer these customers' calls to a special phone line where operators pretended to be the CEO's secretary. In hisblog, Chen noted that the software giant’s operators would tell customers that Gates was unavailable, take their complaint details, and route the information back to tech support, which would then call back, claiming,He explained that support teams followed this process when important customers became upset. If saying sorry and trying to fix the issue didn’t calm them down, the call was sent to a special internal number that sounded like Bill Gates’s office. He noted that this elaborate ruse satisfied angry customers without bothering the billionaire founder of the company, and the support team itself finally handled the issue. Chen revealed this while recounting the 30-year-old procedure used by the company's product support team.In his blog post, Chen wrote:","Microsoft had a specific method for handling angry customers who demanded to speak with Bill Gates.

He states Europe has ""lost the internet"" and cannot guarantee data stays within the EU. This dependence hinders innovation and leaves the continent vulnerable to cyber threats, necessitating a push for European digital sovereignty.

""enormous security problem""

“lost the internet”

""currently impossible""

“We've lost the whole cloud. We have lost the internet, let's be honest. If I want my information 100 per cent in the EU . . . keep on dreaming. You're setting an objective that is not realistic. In cyberspace, everything is commercial. Everything is privately owned,”

""enormous security problem""

How CCB chief Miguel De Bruycker said about improving Europe’s cybersecurity

""blocking""

""Everybody was supporting the Airbus initiatives decades ago.

We need the same initiative on [an] EU level in the cyber domain.""

""technological sovereignty.”

""religious""

""I think on an EU level we should clearly identify what sovereignty means to us in the digital domain. Instead of putting that focus on how can we stop the US 'hyperscalers', maybe we put our energy in... building up something by ourselves,”

""Russian hacktivists""

""Sometimes . . . it's not even a Belgian official, it's an EU official who has said something in Brussels, and they start to attack,""

""It's temporary; it's not stealing any information. It's really disturbing the normal functioning of the website or the portal.""





Belgium's cybersecurity chief, Miguel De Bruycker, has revealed that Europe faces andue to its heavy dependency on American companies for digital infrastructure. In a recent interview, the director of the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB) said that Europe has fallen so far behind the US in digital infrastructure that it has. De Bruycker told the Financial Times that it wasto store data fully in Europe because US companies dominate digital infrastructure across the continent. The Belgian official also warned that Europe's cyber defences even depend on the cooperation of private companies, most of which are American.he added. This dependence represents anfor the EU, said De Bruycker, who has led the CCB since it was founded a decade ago.Beyond security concerns, Europe is also missing out on crucial new technologies being developed in the US and elsewhere, he noted. These include cloud computing and artificial intelligence, both of which are vital for defending European countries against cyberattacks. These comments raise concerns within the European security community about the EU's digital infrastructure falling into the hands of foreign actors.Europe needs to develop its own capabilities to enhance innovation and security, De Bruycker said, adding that legislation such as the EU's AI Act, which regulates the fast-developing technology, wasinnovation. He suggested that EU governments should support private efforts to build scale in areas such as cloud computing or digital identification technologies.It could be similar to when European countries jointly created the planemaker Airbus, he said:Companies such as OVHcloud in France and Schwarz Digital in Germany already provide essential digital infrastructure, according to IT experts.EU countries have been worried about their reliance on US tech companies such as Amazon, with growing calls to increase Europe'sHowever, De Bruycker said those discussions were oftenand lacked focus.he noted.Belgium, as a host of the EU institutions and NATO, has faced increased hybrid attacks allegedly staged by Russia, with more cyber assaults and drone incursions into its airspace since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Last year, Belgium experienced five waves of DDoS attacks lasting days, in which compromised devices overwhelmed the websites of businesses and government agencies, temporarily shutting them down. De Bruycker said the attacks typically targeted up to 20 different organisations per day, withgenerally behind them. Although it was unclear whether the Kremlin was directly sponsoring them, the attacks typically followed as a response to anti-Russian statements by politicians.he said.Although such attacks have increased, De Bruycker does not see them as particularly harmful and says they are primarily aimed at disruption. He said,After Russia invaded Ukraine, the US hyperscalers were crucial in helping salvage data from Russian attacks, De Bruycker added.He also expressed confidence in continued cooperation with American companies to crack down on bad actors, despite US tech companies having aligned themselves closely with the Trump administration, which has repeatedly signalled it would step away from supporting Europe's security.Last month, the US also warned the EU about its strict rules against major tech companies. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) shared a post on X to caution the EU that it will implement sanctions on European tech companies like Spotify, SAP and others if the bloc maintains its current regulatory stance toward American tech companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft.","Belgium's cybersecurity chief Miguel De Bruycker says Europe has ""lost the internet"" and cannot guarantee data stays within the EU.

What Deepinder Goyal’s Temple device tracks and why brain blood flow matters



‘ Gravity Ageing Hypothesis ’ behind Deepinder Goyal’s Temple device



Deepinder Goyal’s personal role in testing the Temple







Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal on Raj Shamani’s Figuring Out podcast , which sparked interest not just for the content of Goyal's remarks but also for entirely different reasons. Online viewers were quick to notice a tiny metallic object that appeared to be affixed to Goyal’s Temple area, sparking rapid speculation throughout social networks. On one hand, comments tapered off into joking around about it possibly being some kind of chewing gum or perhaps a hidden charging connection for his phone or other devices. In truth, there is far more to this tiny device than one can imagine. Its name is Temple, and it is currently one such wearable that focuses on brain functions by monitoring the flow of blood in real time.Temple is a small wearable device resembling a clip that is clipped on the side of the Temple. This device continuously tracks blood circulation to the brain. The amount of blood supply that reaches the brain is understood to be a very relevant pointer to overall neurological function and the ageing processes of the brain. The continuous tracking offered by Temple will allow the wearer to see patterns of blood circulation when they are at work and active versus when they rest or are stressed.The brain requires a stabilised and constant blood supply to function.Any alteration in the blood flow to the brain has been associated with fatigue, lack of concentration, memory problems, and ageing-related cognitive impairments. Researchers have been studying the above in controlled environments with the aid of giant imaging machines, with continuous monitoring in real-life situations not easily possible. Temple seeks to fill the above gap by studying the brain in normal life situations rather than in a controlled environment.Temple's growth is based on what Goyal calls the ‘Gravity Ageing Hypothesis’. This proposal implies that the effect of the force of gravity pulling for many years may lead to a slight effect on the circulation of blood in the body, specifically the energy involved in pushing the blood towards the head for the brain to function properly. According to the hypothesis, the loss of effectiveness in the circulation of blood in the head may contribute to the ageing process. Although the hypothesis is popular, scepticism surrounds the idea because ageing is known to involve a complex interaction of genetic factors, environment, lifestyle, and diseases.Although it has generated a lot of buzz, Temple is still neither a Zomato product nor available for public use. The product has been privately developed by the parent organisation of Zomato, named Eternal, as a part of Goyal's private research initiative named Continue Research. The level of investment made into this project by Goyal has reportedly been to the tune of $25 million. There has been no declaration on the regulatory approval and pricing of the product, which again indicates it is purely a product in the experimental phase.Goyal has not used Temple as a completed product or as the result of a product launch. Rather, Goyal has been using the device on himself for the past year. This has been the result of his interest in health optimisation for quite some time, which has been previously stated by Goyal through public statements. This has included the use of tracking biological markers, fasting schedules, and other health-optimising modalities. Temple represents the natural continuation of these experiments, as Goyal could study the effects of these modalities on blood flow to the brain, with ongoing self-experimentation, data collection, transparency, and iterative refinement methods.",Temple is a small wearable device resembling a clip that is clipped on the side of the Temple.

Goldman Sachs: Companies discussing AI in the context of employees or layoffs appear to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/goldman-sachs-companies-discussing-ai-in-the-context-of-employees-or-layoffs-appear-to-/articleshow/126351092.cms,"Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

'Clear evidence of layoffs directly motivated by AI remains limited'





Is AI leading to layoffs? This is the biggest question that analysts across spectrum have been trying to gauge. Goldman Sachs' recent economic analysis shows a bifurcated picture of artificial intelligence’s impact on the workforce. The findings are claimed to be based on an analysis of third quarter corporate earnings of nearly all the S&P 500 companies and results commentary by senior economist Ronnie Walker. While the analysis showed that a relationship between overall labor market outcomes and AI exposure at the economy-wide level has yet to be established, it also showed something else.“While we still do not find a relationship between labor market outcomes and AI exposure at the economy-wide level,” Walker wrote, “we find that companies that have discussed AI in the context of their workforce have cut their job openings more sharply this year.” Indeed, Walker wrote that most components of Goldman’s layoff tracker “increased notably” in recent months. He highlighted that the companies discussing AI in the context of their workforce or layoffs “indeed appear to be pulling back disproportionately on hiring. ” Walker said that management teams are increasingly viewing AI not just as a tool for efficiency but as a core component of their future human capital strategy, leading to preemptive cuts in new roles.Walker’s piece agrees with a previous analysis by his Goldman colleagues David Mericle and Pierfrancesco Mei, who argued in October that “jobless growth” may become a new normal feature of the post-pandemic economy. In his analysis, Walker found that the companies that most frequently discussed tariffs had “disproportionately cut job openings this year.” Some companies reportedly noted that they planned to reduce costs by “hiring less, reducing headcount, or pursuing productivity-enhancing initiatives (such as investing in AI solutions). ” Goldman Sach's research shows that AI has quickly become a central topic in conversations about headcount within the tech sector since November 2022.Walker found a “bifurcated” outlook, as his research agreed with many economists’ arguments that the U.S. has a “K-shaped economy,” where consumer spending is strong overall, but concerns about lower-income health abound. This underperformance is expected to continue for the low-end consumer into 2026, Walker wrote, reflecting tepid job growth and pressure from benefit cuts.In a related research in October 2025, Goldman Sach's economists Manuel Abecasis and Pierfrancesco Mei wrote, “So far, we do not find clear evidence that most of the increase in these measures is directly motivated by AI, even if we see large increases in tech layoffs across both the Challenger and WARN measures.” They added, “As our portfolio strategy team noted, only a small number of S&P 500 firms have explicitly referenced AI when discussing large-scale layoffs. Most companies instead point to the need to streamline and restructure operations, sometimes attributing these changes to new technologies that enable efficiency gains.”",Goldman Sachs' recent economic analysis shows a bifurcated picture of artificial intelligence’s impact on the workforce.

PWC US CEO Paul Griggs on what made the company change its stance on Crypto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pwc-us-ceo-paul-griggs-on-what-made-the-company-change-its-stance-on-crypto/articleshow/126350160.cms,"""The

Genius Act

and the regulatory rulemaking around stablecoin I expect will create more conviction around leaning into that product and that asset class. The tokenisation of things will certainly continue to evolve as well. PwC has to be in that ecosystem,”

What PWC US CEO Paul Griggs said about the Genius Act

“We feel a responsibility to be hyper-engaged on both sides of the business. Whether we are doing work in the audit space or doing work in the consulting arena — we do all the above in crypto — we see more and more opportunities coming our way,”

“We are never going to lean into a business that we haven’t equipped ourselves to deliver. Over the last 10 to 12 months, as we’ve taken on more opportunities in that digital assets arena, we’ve bolstered our resource pool inside and outside,”





PWC has shifted its outlook on cryptocurrency . PWC US CEO Paul Griggs has confirmed that the company, which is also known as one of the Big Four accounting firms, has decided to “lean in” to cryptocurrency work following the Trump administration’s support for digital assets such as Bitcoin. This shift follows years of the company taking a cautious stance on cryptocurrency. In an interview with the Financial Times (FT), Griggs said that the reversal occurred as the US appointed pro-crypto regulators and Congress passed new laws, such as the “Genius Act”, to govern the industry.Griggs said to FT.These comments reflect how the Trump administration's cryptocurrency policy moves have convinced established businesses that they can enter the digital asset market that many had previously avoided. The change comes as regulatory clarity around digital assets has improved in the US, with new frameworks addressing stablecoins and other crypto products that previously existed in legal uncertainty.The Genius Act, signed into law by US President Donald Trump in July, was the first rule issued by the country for digital tokens tied to tangible assets like the US dollar. This law now allows banks to create and launch their own digital currencies.The Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Paul Atkins, whom Trump appointed, has also made creating rules for cryptocurrency a top priority. In comparison, this is a complete change from the Biden administration, which was hostile toward digital assets.Greggs explained.Until recently, the Big Four accounting firms had largely avoided auditing crypto businesses in the US. They also set strict conditions for working with crypto clients, partly because US regulators were wary of the sector. Regulators worldwide have long raised concerns about crypto, citing risks to consumers and financial stability, as well as its use in fraud and money laundering.After a shift in US policy, PwC began actively advising companies on how they could use crypto technology. According to Griggs, PwC has told clients that tools like stablecoins could help make payment systems more efficient.Other Big Four companies are moving in the same direction. Deloitte, which has audited Coinbase since 2020, released its first “digital assets roadmap” for crypto accounting in May. KPMG has said 2025 could be a turning point for wider digital asset adoption and is promoting services focused on crypto compliance and risk management.PwC has also added crypto-related audit clients, including Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings, which appointed PwC in March. The firm is also pitching tax advice linked to digital assets.Griggs became PwC’s US senior partner in 2024 after nearly 30 years at the firm, during which he led the audit of Goldman Sachs and worked on career development programmes.He said PwC had to bring in outside talent to strengthen its crypto expertise. This included hiring senior partners such as Cheryl Lesnik, who rejoined PwC after spending three years working with crypto clients at a smaller accounting firm.Griggs added.","PwC US CEO Paul Griggs said the company has decided to ‘lean in’ to cryptocurrency work.

FAIR's identity crisis: From blue-sky research to product focus

Tensions simmer as LeCun criticizes LLM-focused strategy





Meta's famed AI research division has lost yet another senior leader, with VP Jitendra Malik announcing his departure to join Amazon's robotics efforts. The exit comes amid mounting turmoil at FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), which some former employees have described as ""dying a slow death"" as Meta pivots aggressively toward commercial AI products. Malik's resignation follows chief AI scientist Yann LeCun's recent departure and adds to a growing exodus of top researchers who helped build Meta's reputation as an AI powerhouse.Malik, who split his time between Meta's FAIR lab and UC Berkeley, announced on January 4 that he will lead Amazon's robotics research in San Francisco starting January 5. ""It is time to move on,"" he wrote on X, highlighting accomplishments including video action recognition models, tactile sensors, and the recent SAM 3D breakthrough in computer vision.The departure caps a tumultuous year for FAIR, a unit once considered Meta's crown jewel in AI development. Since CEO Mark Zuckerberg launched his ""year of intensity"" push in January 2025, the lab has undergone multiple reorganizations, faced budget constraints, and seen more than half the authors of the original Llama research paper leave within months of publication.Former FAIR researchers told Fortune earlier this year that Meta has steadily deprioritized open-ended exploration in favor of product-driven initiatives under the GenAI organization.The lab now gets less computing power than teams focused on generative AI, according to ex-employees, though Meta declined to confirm resource allocation details.In August, Meta consolidated its AI efforts by dividing the Superintelligence Labs into four teams, creating confusion over project ownership and team assignments. The reshuffling was followed by 600 job cuts in October, and Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang framed the layoffs necessary to accelerate decision-making.That instability was compounded when LeCun left to pursue his own project on ""world models""—a path different from that of the large language models that now define Meta's approach to AI. In a December Financial Times interview, LeCun admitted Meta's Llama 4 results were ""fudged a little bit"" and criticized the company's ""LLM-pilled"" direction as incompatible with achieving superintelligence.Former research scientist Tian Yuandong, who left Meta in November, told Chinese media that internal conflicts emerged as computing resources became scarce amid the industrywide LLM race. Another ex-employee, Joena Zhang, wrote that ""nobody really knew what anyone was doing"" during the first half of 2025 at what's now called Meta Superintelligence Labs.Meta says it remains committed to FAIR, and employee sentiment surveys of recent times indicate improvement: Optimism was at 80% by late 2025.","Meta's AI research division, FAIR, is experiencing significant leadership departures.

Video of Lat One v0.1 test flight.

uSTOL achieved. Achievement unlocked

The plane crashed a bit later, which we knew was going to happen, and our simulations had already suggested so, due to structural defects. However, the main objective of the test flight was to test uSTOL, which was successfully demonstrated.

We are already building Lat One v0.2, which should hopefully complete a mission. Making a plane take off is only 20% of the problem. Making it land safely is where the work lies.

Overall, we learnt so much from this entire experience. We will come out better and stronger from this.

When Deepinder Goyal predicted the crash

India has tried building gas turbine engines before. And we’ve come close.

At LAT, we want to get past the finish line. So we’re putting together a propulsion research team in Bangalore, focused solely on building gas turbine engines from scratch. Lightweight. Efficient. Flight-ready. Made in India.

What’s different this time?

We’re giving engineers the freedom to think, build, break, and repeat. Our dedicated research centre — with labs for combustion, turbomachinery, thermal systems, and materials, will give engineers the space and freedom to iterate fast, and get to real outcomes at a speed which is unprecedented in the industry.

Also, this team will be led by engineers. No waiting around for approvals from ""business"" people. No chasing slides or meetings. Just hands-on problem solving, running bench tests, working with suppliers, building hardware from scratch — and pushing the limits of design and physics every day.

It won’t be easy. But if it works, it changes everything. A full engine stack, built locally. Powering STOL aircraft. UAVs. Remote connectivity. Self-reliance.

If you’ve ever built turbines, rotors, control systems — or anything close — and want to be part of something that could one day, rewrite history, write to us at engines@lat.com

Coding Agents have divided developers across the spectrum



How good or bad is the quality of code AI can generate

Complimenting a competitor





A Google principal engineer named Jaaana Dogan has almost gone 'viral' along with her post on how AI has transformed coding in the last one year. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Dogan wrote, ""I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour."" The post that has so far received almost 7 million views has triggered a debate on the role of AI tools like Claude, Google Gemini and others in software coding, with advocates on both sides.Soon after her post on using Claude Code for coding went viral, Dogan clarified that the code generated is not perfect but a good start. ""It's not perfect and I'm iterating on it but this is where we are right now. If you are skeptical of coding agents, try it on a domain you are already an expert of. Build something complex from scratch where you can be the judge of the artifacts,"" she wrote. Talking of Vibe Coding, and how it existed in some form earlier too, she wrote, ""The idea of everyone building software intimidates people.For me, growing up in the 80s and early 90s was unique because we used to program our own personal computers. Programming was an activity for everyone who had a computer.""Dogan lamented that Coding Agents have divided the developer community and that she has never seen a trend that has been as divisive. ""Since working on programming languages, I haven't seen this kind of polarized response from the developer community. There is a ton of hype & fluff about coding agents, which unfortunately often drowns out the genuinely good work being done. Things don't have to be this divisive."" She added in another after a series of posts on the topic, ""Coding agents are the most divisive subject. There are people who genuinely want to learn, there are skeptics, and there are people who are so dogmatic that they want to remove all sorts of communication on this subject. 2026 will be an interesting year.""Dogan said that the developer community has always been divided in camps, and went on to describe three. She wrote: ""The developer community has always been divided into a few camps:- People who are open to new modern tools- People who are building tools with new modern toolsand- People who think you should lose your job for using any modern tools.""When prompted on the quality of the code generated by Claude, Dogan said, ""To cut through the noise on this topic, it’s helpful to provide more more context:- We have built several versions of this system last year. - There are tradeoffs and there hasn't been a clear winner.- When prompted with the best ideas that survived, coding agents are able to go very far and generate a good decent toy version in an hour or so.""The Google engineer called all the controversy around Coding Agents on layoffs. ""All the controversy around coding agents is just a symptom. Where we are as an industry and the state of the job market is the main issue here since the beginning,"" she said.When asked about using a competitor's tool, Dogan said, ""This industry has never been a zero-sum game, so it’s easy to give credit where it’s due even when it's a competitor. Claude Code is impressive work, I'm excited and more motivated to push us all forward.""","Google engineer Jaaana Dogan has almost gone 'viral' along with her post on how AI has transformed coding in the last one year. The post that has so far received almost 7 million views has triggered a debate on the role of AI tools like Claude, Google Gemini and others in software coding.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126346789,imgsize-1323483,width-400,resizemode-4/how-vibe-coding-may-be-39sidelining39-engineers-at-meta39s-superintelligence-labs.jpg"
Ashley St Clair alleges Elon Musk’s Grok ‘undressed’ her childhood images; sparking AI safety concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ashley-st-clair-alleges-elon-musks-grok-undressed-her-childhood-images-sparking-ai-safety-concerns/articleshow/126345938.cms,"Ashley St Clair’s claims against Elon Musk’s AI tool Grok

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

Widespread misuse of Grok’s image-manipulation features

What sparked the Grok digital undressing backlash





Ashley St Clair has accused Elon Musk ’s AI chatbot Grok of generating sexually suggestive edits of her photographs without consent, including images taken when she was only 14 years old. The allegations have surfaced amid growing concern over Grok’s ability to digitally alter images on X in response to explicit user prompts. St Clair, a columnist who previously made headlines after claiming she shares a child with Musk, says the incident represents a serious breach of consent, safety, and child protection laws. Her public statements have intensified scrutiny on xAI and its safeguards, while also reopening wider debates around AI misuse, accountability, and the risks faced by women and minors on large social media platforms.Ashley St Clair asserts that she found that Grok had reproduced modified pictures of her despite assurances that this chatbot would not create non-consensual pictures. On X, she began writing a series of messages where she accused Grok of sharing such pictures despite her objections. She demanded that this chatbot remove the posts and identification details that would be needed in case of legal proceedings against xAI.The most problematic part of the allegation from St Clair is the imagery that she was 14 at the time it was produced. Grok generated a bikini picture in response to an instruction from a user.The original picture was a child's image that had been transformed. According to a media article quoting the now-deleted Facebook account of the alleged victim, Grok was accused by the victim of making things that might make them uncomfortable in the future. Despite the imagery not involving full nudity, the alleged victim expressed the desire for it to be deleted.St Clair was quite expressive when she condemned the incident, with Grok’s actions described as ‘horrifying’ and ‘illegal’ by the Instagram spokesperson. St Clair has denied charges that her reaction to the incident is a product of her own hatred for Mike Krieger, explaining that this is a matter that involves safety. St Clair has given various reasons for her stand, including that the situation is rather contradictory.Concerns about Grok have been given further strength by a Reuters investigation. Reporters assessed public inputs given to the chatbot over a short period, finding over 100 attempts to use the image-manipulation tool in the digital alteration of photographs to partially undress individuals in the image. These are mostly young females, although there are also requests for males, public figures, and pets, highlighting systemic safeguards gaps, ethical risks, and urgent regulatory oversight.X has been inundated by images of women displayed in minimal clothing and/or changed clothing, all produced by the use of AI images. These images primarily followed the activation of Grok to ""undress"" women and display them in bikinis. The chatbot was known to have responded to a vast array of these requests, thereby editing the images of women into sexually explicit images of themselves without their consent. The response of the women was not long in coming in the form of complaints.The allegations being made against St Clair concern important aspects of consent, safety features of AI, and child safety laws. However, looking at the situation in its entirety, there is a growing need for greater control over the use of generative AI technology, putting pressure once again on Elon Musk and his ventures to be accountable.",Ashley St Clair has accused Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok of generating sexually suggestive edits of her photographs without consent.

Ten technology trends to watch in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ten-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2026/articleshow/126344580.cms,"After years of AI hype, 2026 brings a reality check. Companies need to prove their billion-dollar bets are worth it. Data centres are spreading globally, straining power grids. AI agents are moving from pilots to production. Robots are getting smarter. New hardware forms are arriving. Meanwhile, tech billionaires keep getting richer. The gap between hype and deployment is shrinking fast, and 2026 could turn out to be a real pivoting year.

Robots become real(er)

The startup birth rate soars

Tech billionaires get even richer

What the 2026 really looks like





After years of AI hype and billion-dollar bets, 2026 is shaping up to be a reality check for the tech industry. Companies that dumped money into generative AI tools now face a simple question: show us the value, or shut it down.The pace of change isn't slowing. If anything, it's getting faster. Tools that seemed cutting-edge six months ago already feel outdated. Companies are racing to stay ahead, while also trying to prove their investments weren't wasted.Here are the ten trends in technology to watch out for in 2026.The experimental phase is over. Enterprises spent 2024 and 2025 testing AI pilots and proof-of-concept projects. Now they want measurable returns on those investments.""2026 is the 'show me the money' year for AI,"" says Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures. Companies will demand hard ROI numbers. Those that can't deliver value will see their software renewals drop and their fundraising dry up.This pressure will split the market. Some AI companies will thrive by solving specific problems well. Others will struggle or fail entirely. Ganesan predicts at least one major AI company will face severe financial trouble or bankruptcy in 2026.The flip side: successful companies could go public. Both OpenAI and SpaceX are eyeing IPOs at valuations near $1 trillion. If these launches succeed, they'll create a wave of new wealth and validate AI's business potential.You heard a lot about data centres in 2025. Get ready to hear more in 2026.The infrastructure boom that started in the US and China is going global. India is attracting massive investment from tech giants. Microsoft committed $17.5 billion to new data centres there. Before Microsoft's CEO left the stage at that announcement, Amazon declared it would spend $35 billion on its own facilities. Google and Meta quickly followed with their own multi-billion dollar plans.Southeast Asia is seeing double-digit growth in data centre capacity. Brazil wants to become Latin America's hub. Saudi Arabia and the UAE struck $600 billion in AI deals with the US, including plans for the largest AI campus outside America.This expansion creates real problems. These facilities consume enormous amounts of electricity and water. In hot regions, cooling requirements push consumption even higher. Brazil has already seen blackouts tied to data centre demand. Local communities often can't find out how much power and water a facility will use, thanks to legal secrecy.China offers a warning: just because you build it doesn't mean they'll come. The country rushed to construct about 150 new data centres in 2024. Now up to 80% of that new computing capacity sits unused, struggling to find customers.AI hasn't replaced most workers yet. Even though it has impacted a big number of workers, changing how work gets done in particular niches.Coding looks completely different than it did five years ago. Developers use AI assistants that can generate, debug, and refactor code. The technology has matured enough that these tools genuinely save time. Customer service is being handed over to chatbots, despite customer frustration.AI agents were the buzzword of 2025, but most stayed in pilot programs. Only 11% of organisations actually deployed them in production, despite 38% running tests. The gap between pilot and production tells the real story. Many companies automated broken processes instead of redesigning their operations from scratch. That approach rarely works.In 2026, agents will become more capable and trustworthy. They'll handle complex, multi-step tasks without constant human oversight. Think booking entire trips, negotiating better service rates, or managing workflows across different systems. ""A year from now, answering questions will be the least useful thing AI can do,"" says Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications. ""We'll have proactive AI assistants constantly running in the background, getting things done for us. ""But there's a catch. Many companies will spin out hundreds of agents per employee, only to see most sit idle. Without proper integration into existing workflows, these agents become expensive shelfware. The winners will be companies that connect agents to deterministic systems and give them clear, focused tasks.The smartphone has looked basically the same for a decade: a big black screen with some buttons on the side. That's changing.Apple is rumoured to release a folding phone in 2026. Android devices have already gone this route, even including some phones that fold twice. But Apple's loyal customer base could make folding screens mainstream.Then, a lot of others are also racing to build the first successful AI hardware device. OpenAI invested $6.5 billion in Jony Ive's startup, which is working on a physical AI product. The Humane pin and Friend necklace both made noise but never caught on. Humane has already shut down.Smart glasses present the most promising direction. They're already popular, and Meta dominates the space. In 2026, expect these devices to get smarter and more common. They offer a natural way to interact with AI without pulling out your phone.You'll also see AI show up in places you didn't ask for it. Samsung already added its Bixby assistant to refrigerators back in 2024. Hotels might offer smart duvets. Your rental car might have an AI assistant. Not all of this will be useful or wanted.The AI infrastructure race is shifting from raw scale to efficiency. You can't keep throwing more computing power at every problem.""2026 will be the year of frontier versus efficient model classes,"" says Kaoutar El Maghraoui, a principal research scientist at IBM. Next to huge models with billions of parameters, you'll see efficient, hardware-aware models running on modest accelerators.The hardware race won't only be about GPUs anymore. ASICs, chiplet designs, analogue inference, and quantum-assisted optimisers will all mature. A new class of chips designed specifically for running AI agents could emerge.Think of it like air traffic control for AI workloads. Computing power will be packed more densely and routed dynamically. If one job slows, another moves in instantly. Nothing sits idle. This makes infrastructure smarter, more sustainable, and more adaptable.Quantum computing is also reaching an inflection point. Microsoft, Google, and others believe quantum machines will start tackling problems that classical computers can't handle. Hybrid systems that combine quantum, AI, and supercomputers could drive breakthroughs in materials science, drug development, and climate modelling.Large language models dominated AI development for the past few years. They predict the next word in a sequence. In 2026, a different approach could take centre stage: world models.World models work by learning from videos, simulations, and spatial inputs. Instead of predicting the next word, they predict what happens next in the physical world. They model how things move over time.This matters for robotics, video games, and any application where AI needs to understand cause and effect without being explicitly programmed. World models can grasp concepts like gravity or momentum just by watching.Google, Meta, and Chinese companies like Tencent are all developing world models. Yann LeCun, one of AI's pioneers, left Meta to launch a world model startup. Fei-Fei Li's company World Labs released its first model in 2025.At the same time, Europe is moving in a different direction: small language models. These are lightweight versions of LLMs designed to run on smartphones or low-powered computers. They use fewer parameters and consume less energy, but they can still handle text generation, translation, and question-answering.Small models make economic sense amid talk of the AI bubble bursting. They cost less to build, less to run, and don't require massive data centres. European governments are increasingly wary of depending on American AI infrastructure, which could accelerate investment in smaller, more sustainable models.AI security becomes mission-criticalAI creates a cybersecurity paradox: the same capabilities driving business innovation are also introducing new risks. In 2026, organisations will face mounting pressure to secure AI systems while defending against AI-powered attacks.The threats are multiplying fast. Shadow AI deployments bypass security controls. Adversarial attacks manipulate models into producing wrong outputs. AI agents operating with broad system access create new attack surfaces. ""Every agent should have similar security protections as humans,"" says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security.Even OpenAI is sounding the alarm. CEO Sam Altman recently acknowledged that AI models are ""starting to present some real challenges,"" including models that are ""so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities."" The company is actively hiring a new Head of Preparedness to study emerging AI-related risks, from cybersecurity threats to mental health impacts. The role comes with a $555,000 salary, reflecting how seriously the company takes these challenges.Companies will need to secure four domains: data, models, applications, and infrastructure. Defenders are fighting back with AI agents for red teaming, adversarial training, and automated threat detection at machine speed.Robots are nothing like what they used to be. From pre-programmed machines, they are evolving into adaptive systems capable of perception, learning, and autonomous operation. Physical AI is breaking out of warehouses and into mainstream use.Amazon has already deployed its millionth robot, and if the company is to be believed, AI coordinates entire fleets, and that’s helping them save travel time by about 10%. At BMW plants, cars now drive themselves along production routes. The real magic, however, is when world models combine with robotics, allowing systems to comprehend their surroundings and adapt to surprises.The next frontier is humanoid robots that can navigate spaces designed for humans, as companies race to craft machines capable of doing just that. The potential stretches across manufacturing, healthcare, and disaster response, and is increasingly accessible beyond the early adopters as costs fall.AI coding tools are making it easier than ever to build software. The result: a wave of new startups hitting the market in 2026.Tools like Replit, Cursor, and Loveable let people build products without engineering backgrounds. You can go from idea to working software faster than ever before. Building AI agents is also getting simpler. Business users can create them without touching code.Not every startup will make it. Markets will get crowded. Competition will heat up. But the sheer number of new companies will reshape the landscape and push established players to move faster.Tech's wealthiest executives are about to get a lot wealthier. Ten top earners added $550 billion to their fortunes in 2025. The trend isn't slowing down.Two massive IPOs are coming: OpenAI and SpaceX, both valued near $1 trillion. SpaceX's debut will add tens of billions to Elon Musk's net worth, which already sits around $600 billion. He's also eligible for two Tesla pay packages worth a combined $1.056 trillion. Sam Altman stands to benefit from OpenAI's listing, along with major backers like Microsoft. Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg , and Satya Nadella have all seen their wealth climb as AI investments pay off.Larry Ellison might be the exception. Oracle's stock dropped hard as investors questioned AI spending, erasing $80 billion in market value.Every trend in tech seems to point in one direction: more wealth flowing upward. The AI boom, the data centre buildout, the chip shortage, the agent revolution—all of it concentrates power and money in fewer hands. A handful of tech executives now wield enormous influence over technology that affects everyone's daily life.Every trend here points to the same reality: the distance between hype and deployment is collapsing. Tech used to take years to move from labs to living rooms. Now it takes months, sometimes weeks.This creates winners and losers fast. Companies that can't prove AI's value will fold. Workers in certain fields will find their jobs radically different or gone entirely. Cities welcoming data centres might face power shortages they didn't plan for. Meanwhile, a small group of tech billionaires keeps getting richer off all of it, concentrating more control over systems that affect billions of people.The pace isn't slowing down. If anything, 2026 will be the year when that becomes impossible to ignore.","After years of AI hype, 2026 brings a reality check. Companies need to prove their billion-dollar bets are worth it.

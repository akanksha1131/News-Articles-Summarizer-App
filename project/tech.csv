YouTube launches free AI music-making tool for creators: How it works and more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-launches-free-ai-music-making-tool-for-creators-how-it-works-and-more/articleshow/120187801.cms,"How YouTube’s Music Assistant tool works

YouTube Music Assistant tool: Availability and features

YouTube has introduced a new AI-powered music-making tool designed to help creators generate custom, royalty-free instrumental tracks for their videos. The feature, called Music Assistant, is part of YouTube's Creator Music marketplace and aims to simplify the process of adding high-quality background music to content.The Music Assistant tool allows creators to describe the type of music they need using simple text prompts. Users can specify details such as instruments, mood, and the type of video the music is for. Based on these inputs, the AI generates multiple music options, which creators can download and use without worrying about copyright claims.For example, creators can request ""calm and peaceful music with acoustic guitar and flowing piano"" or ""happy mood songs with good beats."" The tool provides granular control over the generated tracks, ensuring they align perfectly with the creator's vision.Currently, the Music Assistant is being rolled out to US-based creators who are part of the YouTube Partner Program and have access to the Creator Music marketplace. The tool builds on YouTube's earlier experiment, Dream Tracks, which focused on generating short music clips. Unlike Dream Tracks, Music Assistant is tailored for creating longer instrumental tracks suitable for a variety of video formats.The generated music is completely free to use, offering creators a cost-effective alternative to traditional licensing options. This feature is expected to reduce the time and effort spent on sourcing music, enabling creators to focus more on storytelling and content production.","YouTube has introduced a new AI-powered music-making tool designed to help creators generate custom, royalty-free instrumental tracks for their videos.

Google VP on Trump Tariffs

Google parent Alphabet has reportedly reaffirmed its plan to invest $75 billion in 2025 to bolster its data center infrastructure, shrugging off concerns over US tariff uncertainties. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the announcement reportedly made on Wednesday (April 10) comes as investors grapple with the hefty price tag of AI initiatives amid volatile markets and an unclear economic future shaped by President Donald Trump’s trade policies.Google CEO Sundar Pichai , speaking at Google’s annual cloud computing conference Google CloudNext, emphasized that the funds would fuel the purchase of chips and construction of servers. These investments aim to enhance Alphabet’s flagship products like Search while advancing AI innovations, including its Gemini model. “The opportunity with AI is as big as it gets,” Pichai said, underscoring the company’s bullish stance on the technology.The $75 billion figure, initially disclosed in February, is said to exceed analyst expectations by 29%, sparking both excitement and unease among shareholders. Investors remain wary of the escalating costs of AI development, particularly as Trump’s recent tariff adjustments—easing duties on some nations while intensifying them on China—add complexity to budgeting for hardware imports.Sachin Gupta, Google Cloud’s vice president and infrastructure general manager, acknowledged the potential cost increases tied to tariffs. “We’re all processing what’s happening with tariffs,” he told Reuters, but stressed that robust customer demand justifies the spending surge.Alphabet’s stock soared nearly 10% on Wednesday, contributing to a $1.5 trillion market value surge among the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants. The move mirrors bold AI spending plans from rivals, with Microsoft pledging over $80 billion and Meta targeting up to $65 billion for 2025.Analysts see AI, alongside cybersecurity, as a rare bright spot where businesses are maintaining investment momentum despite economic headwinds. “Early wins from customers adopting Google Cloud as their go-to AI platform are fueling the push for aggressive expansion,” said Chiraj Mehta, principal analyst at Constellation Research, as per the report.","Google parent Alphabet reportedly reaffirmed its plan to invest $75 billion in 2025 to bolster its data center infrastructure.

"US Cellular to cut 4,100 jobs following T-Mobile acquisition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-cellular-to-cut-4100-jobs-following-t-mobile-acquisition/articleshow/120172952.cms,"Read the letter US Cellular sent to US Department of Employment Services



“We write to inform you that United States Cellular Corporation (""USCC"") plans to sell all of its wireless operations, customers, and approximately 30% of its licensed spectrum to T-Mobile US, Inc. (""T-Mobile""). Consistent with these plans, approximately 4,100 employees will be permanently separated from employment with USCC Management Services, LLC at personal locations used by employees working remotely as well as the corporate-owned locations identified on Exhibit A. Employment separations are planned to commence on June 2, 2025 or within fourteen days thereafter. However, USCC has made arrangements with T-Mobile to offer employment to a majority of these employees at a salary or wage rate and with benefits that, when taken as a whole, are no less favorable than these employees' current salary or wage rate and benefits

This announcement and the above timetable are based on the best information currently available. However, various factors may still affect these plans and the timing of employee separations.

This letter is not an admission that any employment separation that takes place as a result of this transaction constitutes a covered event under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act or any applicable state counterpart. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact me by telephone at 773-399-4130 UScellularHR@ uscellular.com.”

T-Mobile's recent acquisition of US Cellular has set off a restructuring plan at the fourth-largest US telecom company. The wireless phone provider has confirmed that the change will result in 4,100 job cuts. The workforce reduction is part of an effort to integrate the acquired operations with T-Mobile's existing network systems and streamline business processes. Company officials indicated that the decision follows detailed financial reviews and regulatory filings, aiming to eliminate redundancies and improve operational efficiency. The layoffs are expected to affect various departments across the organisation, with notifications to affected employees scheduled to begin “on June 2 or within 14 days thereafter.” An SEC filing from December 31, 2024, states that the company nearly has ""4,100 full-time and part-time associates.""However, a majority of the affected employees are expected to be offered roles with T-Mobile, complete with compensation and benefits that match or exceed their current packages, according to a US Cellular official. The layoffs will affect staff at corporate-owned stores in Cedar Rapids, Coralville, and Iowa City, as well as employees at a call center in southwest Cedar Rapids. This comes after T-Mobile agreed to purchase UScellular's wireless operations and select spectrum assets in a transaction estimated at $4.4 billion in May 2024. The deal is expected to close by mid-2025.In a letter sent to James Clopton, program manager with the U.S. Department of Employment Services, UScellular employee relations director Izik Youker wrote:The letter also includes the locations used by employees working remotely, as well as the company-owned locations.","T-Mobile's recent acquisition of US Cellular has set off a restructuring plan at the fourth-largest US telecom company.

Nabors may have used his daughter's company to breach Mr Beast’s IT network



Jimmy Donaldson, also known as Mr Beast, has filed a lawsuit against former employee Leroy Nabors . In the lawsuit, the YouTuber alleges that Nabors misappropriated trade secrets and breached a non-disclosure agreement. The lawsuit (seen by Polygon) that was filed earlier this month in a US court claims that Nabors, who was hired by Mr Beast’s company in 2023, allegedly downloaded over a thousand confidential files, including sensitive business strategies and employee information, before his termination in October 2024. Additionally, the complaint alleges that the ex-employee installed hidden cameras throughout MrBeast 's offices. Donaldson's company, which employs nearly 350 people and reported $473 million in revenue last year, is seeking damages and a permanent injunction for the return and deletion of the obtained data.As per the lawsuit, Nabors was initially hired as an IT contractor and was responsible for managing the company's IT network, including servers containing post-production content. He subcontracted his daughter's company, Vine Networks, to assist with these duties, the complaint alleged.In late 2023, Mr Beast’s company moved Nabors to the ""special projects"" team within the development department, which focuses on content production, fundraising, and political advocacy. He remained in this role until his termination on October 1, 2024, the lawsuit noted.Due to the sensitive nature of his IT role, Nabors signed a non-disclosure agreement. However, after an internal review, the company revealed that before his termination, he downloaded over a thousand confidential files, including business strategies, financial data, and employee personal information.When confronted, Nabors claimed the downloads were part of routine backups. Additionally, he had synced files to a personal Dropbox account, retaining access to sensitive information after his departure, the lawsuit added.Further investigation uncovered multiple hidden cameras installed throughout the company's offices, the lawsuit mentioned. The company also noted that no current employees admitted to installing these devices, but Nabors was known for recording meetings without consent. The company believes that Nabors and Vine Networks controlled access to these cameras.","Jimmy Donaldson, also known as Mr Beast, has filed a lawsuit against former employee Leroy Nabors.

A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”In response, Walmart defended its contributions to communities and the economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year.”The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments. It's been almost a week, and this aesthetic obsession shows no signs of slowing down, with creators using AI tools, hand-drawn art, and photo edits to channel the magic of My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. But why stop at static photos? Let’s ride this wave and turn your Ghibli-style masterpieces into an animation video that’ll have your followers hitting “replay.” Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli aesthetic:The viral buzz started with fans and creators posting Ghibli-inspired snapshots—think lush landscapes and soulful characters, often AI-generated with tools like Midjourney or hand-drawn by digital artists.

A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions. Some of the best options include:Adobe After Effects : Ideal for advanced users, offering powerful animation tools and visual effects.Blender: A free, open-source 3D software that allows for detailed animation and rendering.Procreate Dreams: Huge on iPad-toting artists in this trend—hand-draw frames for that authentic Ghibli feel.RunwayML: AI fans love this for interpolating motion between images, cutting down work while keeping it share-worthy.CapCut: Free, fast, and TikTok-friendly for quick edits if you’re new to this.Once you’ve selected your software:Import all your Ghibli-style images into the software.Organize assets by layers (backgrounds, midgrounds, and foregrounds).Group character movements or effects into separate layers for better control.To create smooth animations:Keyframe Animation: Set keyframes at major points to define object positions and movements.Tweening: Fill in the frames between keyframes to achieve smooth transitions.Parallax Effect: Create depth by animating foreground and background layers independently.Studio Ghibli’s charm lies in its attention to environmental details. To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.

"USCIS' 'plain and straight message' to H1-B, Green Card and other visa applicants: There are only two...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uscis-plain-and-straight-message-to-h1-b-green-card-and-other-visa-applicants-there-are-only-two-/articleshow/119938630.cms,"USCIS recognizes two biological sex

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further added that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy to shareholders in annual letter: Amazon has to operate like the 'world’s largest startup',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-to-shareholders-in-annual-letter-amazon-has-to-operate-like-the-worlds-largest-startup/articleshow/120169326.cms,"Read what Andy Jassy said about operating Amazon as a startup



“Operate like a startup (in our case, the world’s largest startup). We strive to operate like the world’s largest startup. What does that mean?

First, whatever we're contemplating building has to be focused on solving a real customer problem or meaningfully improving a customer experience. Companies can get off track prioritizing technology because they’re excited about the technology. Great startups are on a mission to change what’s possible for customers.

Second, we have a disproportionate need for builders. These are inventors. They’re people constantly dissecting customer experiences, even ones that seem pretty good today, and asking why they can’t be better. They’re divinely discontent (maybe annoyingly so for team members proud of what they’ve previously built), and never feel like the job is done.

Third, we want owners. One of the strengths of Amazon over the first 30 years is that we've hired really smart, motivated, inventive, ambitious people who have been great owners. And, that means that our teammates are constantly asking themselves, “What would I do if this was my own money?” “What would I do if I started this company and I was the majority owner?” “Hey, I know I’ve only been asked to own a part of this project, but I’m not sure if the other parts are being driven well—should I stick my nose into this and make sure or just trust somebody’s got it?” Owners feel accountable. They care deeply about the quality and effectiveness of what they own, and view the company’s mission as their mission (we want missionaries, not mercenaries). That's part of what our effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors versus managers is about. We want flatter organizations where our owners doing the work feel like they own the two-way door decisions (which are the vast majority), can move rapidly, and are fully accountable for solving the Whys of their customer experiences.

Fourth, speed disproportionately matters for every business, in every industry, at all times. It’s a false binary to argue that you can move fast or deliver high standards. If you want to be fast, you can be fast, and still be high quality. We’ve done it for many years (though we can still be faster). Speed is a leadership decision. The leadership team has to believe it’s a priority, reinforce it constantly, organize and remove structural barriers, and build in modular ways that enable pace. But, speed does not happen unless the entire company and culture embrace it. We have this persistent feeling, throughout the company and in every business in which we operate, that there are closing windows all around us. We operate in fiercely competitive market segments, with highly talented, well-funded, ambitious companies at every turn. Customers are always looking for something better. We spend a lot of time identifying how to unlock these experiences for them as quickly as possible, and know if we don’t, somebody else will.

Another way to gain speed is to eliminate bureaucracy. There is a difference between process and bureaucracy. When you're running something at scale, you need mechanisms to deliver the right experience and constant improvement for customers. However, as companies grow and add more managers, unneeded processes get layered on that add little value. Last fall, I asked teammates across the company to send me bureaucracy examples that they were experiencing. I’ve received almost 1,000 of these emails, and read every single one. Builders hate bureaucracy. It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came here to do. As leaders, we don’t always see the red tape buried deep in our organizations, but we can sure as heck eliminate it when we do. We’ve already made over 375 changes based on this feedback. We need to move fast, and we are committed to rooting out bureaucracy that ties up time and dispirits our teammates.

Fifth, you have to be scrappy. As businesses succeed and get larger, they sometimes forget how things got started. We built

Amazon Simple Storage Service

(S3) with 13 people;

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

(EC2) with 11 people. Managers can confuse themselves that the way to grow and get ahead is to accumulate large teams. Historically, we’ve had periods where we’ve allowed this thinking to hold sway. But, it’s not the way we fundamentally think about building teams and products, and have adjusted to reflect that again. Our best leaders get the most done with the least number of resources required to do the job. They pride themselves on being lean.

Sixth, you have to be willing to take risks. This sounds easier than it is. You need clever enough people to identify worthwhile bets. And if you have these inventive, ambitious builders with high standards, they’re not used to failure. They suspect external (and maybe internal) ridicule awaits them if they try something very different that doesn’t work out. So, people often play it safe. But, you can’t achieve something extraordinary for customers by playing “not to lose.” If your Whys take you down an invention path that delivers an experience that doesn’t look like what’s been done before, let customer obsession be your compass. You rarely, if ever, change the world by doing the same thing as everybody else.

And finally, you have to care most about delivering compelling results for customers. It's not how charismatic you are. It's not whether you're really good at managing up or sideways. What matters is what we actually get done for customers. That’s what we want to reward.”","Andy Jassy: Amazon strives to operate like the world’s largest startup. Whatever we're contemplating building has to be focused on solving a real customer problem. Speed disproportionately matters for every business, in every industry, at all times, he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120169274,imgsize-35162,width-400,resizemode-4/Amazon-CEO-Andy-Jassy-to-shareholders-in-annual-letter-Amazon-has-to-operate-like-the-worlds-largest-startup.jpg"
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy may have agreed to what Google’s Sundar Pichai said on investing billions in AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-may-just-have-agreed-to-what-googles-sundar-pichai-said-on-billions-in-ai-investment/articleshow/120167582.cms,"Amazon CEO’s remarks in lines with Sundar Pichai

‘In future, AI will not be as expensive as it is today’

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy , in his annual letter to shareholders, has defended the company’s significant multi-billion dollar expenditures on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, asserting that such investment is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the evolving market.“If your mission is to make customers' lives better and easier every day, and you believe every customer experience will be reinvented by AI, you're going to invest deeply and broadly in AI,” he said. He emphasised the necessity of considerable capital investment to procure the specialised AI chips required for advanced processing and to construct the extensive data center infrastructure needed to support AI operations.Jassy's remarks concerning Amazon's financial outlays on artificial intelligence development resonate with statements made by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday at a Google Cloud event. During the Google Cloud event, Pichai reiterated Alphabet's plans for a substantial capital expenditure of approximately $75 billion this year.He said that the investment will buy the chips and build the servers needed to better Alphabet's core offerings, including Search, as well as develop AI services such as its Gemini model.“The opportunity with AI is as big as it gets,” he said, while making a surprise appearance at the company's annual conference for its cloud computing unit, as per Reuters.On similar lines, Jassy said in the shareholders letter, ""We continue to believe AI is a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention of everything we know, the demand is unlike anything we’ve seen before, and our customers, shareholders, and business will be well-served by our investing aggressively now.”Jassy also touched upon the high costs of AI chips saying, “AI does not have to be as expensive as it is today, and it won’t be in the future.”He said that AI chips are the biggest culprit for high cost because “most AI to date has been built on one chip provider.

“The simple fact is that Mr. Tan is unqualified to serve as the head of any company competing against China, let alone one with actual intelligence and national security ramifications like Intel and its tremendous legacy connections to all areas of America’s intelligence and the defense ecosystem,""

""He was at the top of my list and most investor's lists of who they wanted. He's a legend and he's been around forever,”

What Intel said about its CEO’s Chinese investments



""We handle any potential conflicts appropriately and provide disclosures as required by SEC rules,""

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan ’s appointment is under scrutiny amid concerns over his investments in Chinese tech companies, a report claims. Tan is reportedly one of Silicon Valley's longest-running investors in Chinese companies. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the newly-appointed CEO of a company that manufactures chips for the US Department of Defense holds stakes in over 600 Chinese companies and controls more than 40 Chinese firms and funds, including at least eight with links to the People’s Liberation Army. Tan’s investment background has raised concerns among some investors. The report notes that several Intel investors who were interviewed has predicted that the scope of Tan’s investments could complicate the task of reviving the chip maker. Its also important to note that besides TSMC and Samsung , Intel is the only US-based chip maker that manufactures the most advanced computer chips.In a statement to Reuters, Andrew King, a partner at venture capital firm Bastille Ventures expressed his concerns about Tan’s capabilities to serve as Intel’s CEO. He also mentioned that neither he or his company is invested in the chipmaker.King said.However, some analysts argued that Tan's experience investing in Chinese startups can offer the required skills needed to revive the struggling American chipmaker.Bernstein analyst Stacey Rasgon said.As per the report, Tan made his investments through his venture capital firm, Walden International, and two Hong Kong-based holding companies, Sakarya Limited and Seine Limited. As of October 31, 2024, he was the sole owner of Sakarya, and he controls Seine via Walden. Tan continues to serve as the chairman of Walden International.Its also important to note that US citizens are legally allowed to invest in Chinese companies, including those with military affiliations, unless the companies are specifically listed on the US Treasury's Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List, which prohibits such investments. The report didn’t found any evidence that Lip-Bu Tan currently holds direct investments in any company on this list.An Intel spokesperson said that Tan has completed a questionnaire for directors and officers, which necessitates the disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest. However, the company didn’t comment on his investments in China.the spokesperson noted.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan's appointment is under scrutiny amid concerns over his investments in Chinese tech companies, a report claims.

Price tag for US-made iPhones could reach $3,500





India, not US, is where Apple could head next

President Donald Trump and his administration wants Apple to manufacture iPhones in the United States. ""Absolutely. He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday, April 8, when asked if Trump thought iPhone manufacturing could move to the US. ""If Apple didn't think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn't have put up that big chunk of change,"" she added, referring to Apple's recently announced $500 billion US investment.Trump doubled down on Wednesday through his Truth Social network: ""This is a great time to move your company into the US, like Apple, and so many others, in record numbers, are doing.""However, Apple CEO Tim Cook and iPhone maker’s founder Steve Jobs have consistently maintained that iPhone manufacturing in the US faces insurmountable obstacles.The late Steve Jobs explained the issue to President Barack Obama as far back as 2010, according to Walter Isaacson 's biography. Jobs stated that Apple employed 700,000 factory workers in China because it needed 30,000 engineers on-site to support those workers. ""You can't find that many in America to hire,"" he said.Current CEO Tim Cook has been equally forthright. In 2017, he told Fortune that companies like Apple rely on countries such as China not for cheap labor, but for the quality and quantity of skilled workers.""The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill,"" Cook said. ""[Our] products require really advanced tooling. The precision that you have to have in tooling, and working with the materials that we do, are state-of-the-art, and the tooling skill is very deep here.""Cook added: ""In the US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.""If iPhone manufacturing were somehow shifted to the US, consumers would face dramatic price increases. Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN that US-made iPhones could cost around $3,500 – more than triple the current ~$1,000 price tag – due to the necessity of replicating Asia's complex production ecosystem.""You build that (supply chain) in the US with a fab in West Virginia and New Jersey. They'll be $3,500 iPhones,"" Ives said. He estimated it would cost Apple approximately $30 billion and three years to relocate just 10% of their supply chain to the US.Morgan Stanley analysts projected ""several billions"" in costs for Apple to shift even a portion of iPhone production to the US, making domestic manufacturing financially prohibitive compared to simply paying the new tariffs.Apple has manufacturing presence in the US, but that isn’t even a minuscule percentage of what it is doing in Asia – iPhones are being made in China and India; Macs and iPads too in China; and in Vietnam Apple produces about 90% of its wearables. Meanwhile, in the US, it only produces Mac, that too, in small numbers. Last year, it began producing A16 chips, and is also pushing for silicon manufacturing but not hardware, announcing an investment of over $500 billion, the same Leavitt was referring to, but then again it’s more of a partnership with Taiwan’s TSMC.As Trump's administration imposes steep tariffs on Chinese goods – reaching at least 125% and Vietnam being hit with 46% tariffs – Apple is looking to India as a more viable alternative for iPhone production. According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple plans to increase shipments of India-made iPhones to the US to mitigate China tariff impacts.In the weeks leading up to Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement, Apple has been exporting a major chunk, about 85%, of its India produce in the months of January and February to the US. In March, Apple sent at least half a dozen, per Reuters or some also say about 10 chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tonnes of iPhones, about 1.5 million units from India to the US.Apple also worked with Indian authorities to establish a ""green corridor,"" at Chennai airport - a practice it also uses in the China, reducing customs clearance time from 30 hours to just six hours.Foxconn, Apple's main supplier in India, even extended operations to include Sunday shifts at its Chennai factory, which produced 20 million iPhones last year.India's smartphone exports jumped more than 50% in the 12 months ending March compared to the previous year, according to the country's technology minister. Apple exported more than $17 billion of iPhones from India last year, showing rapid expansion in the country.Apple has been methodically building its Indian manufacturing presence for years, beginning with older iPhone models in 2017 and gradually expanding to include the latest versions. The Financial Times reports that Tata is now developing capacity as an Apple supplier in India, though the country still lacks the comprehensive supply chain infrastructure of China, where 169 of Apple's 187 top suppliers maintained manufacturing operations according to the company's 2023 supplier list.Bank of America analyst notes that Apple was on pace to produce about 25 million iPhones in India this year before tariffs were announced. If Apple redirected all India-made iPhones to the US, it could meet approximately 50% of American demand this year.With India's tariff rate set at a lower 26% rate compared to China and Vietnam , Apple would face significantly lower import costs for devices manufactured in India. And the current pause at reciprocal tariffs, which China is not part of, makes up for even a sweeter deal for Apple.While Trump's administration promotes a vision of American iPhone factories employing millions, the reality of Apple's global supply chain – with its 387 individual iPhone components and deeply interconnected Asian manufacturing base – suggests that complete relocation to the US is going to be a tough challenge for Apple. The reason is simple math.","President Donald Trump and his administration want Apple to manufacture iPhones in the United States.

SpaceX Mars plans face challenges after second Starship test failure

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X announcing that SpaceX will launch a Starship carrying Optimus explorer robots to Mars by the end of 2026. “Starship will hopefully depart for Mars at the end of next year with Optimus explorer robots!,” Mush wrote in the post. The tech billionaire quoted a post by X user named Curiosity @MAstronomers showing rover images of Mars' surface.The announcement comes a month later when Musk revealed an ambitious timeline for the company's Mars mission. According to Musk's timeline, if these robotic landings prove successful, human missions to Mars could begin as soon as 2029, though he acknowledged that 2031 is a more realistic target date.“If those landings go well, then human landings may start as soon as 2029, although 2031 is more likely,” he said in an X post last month.Earlier this year, an image captured by NASA’s decommissioned Mars Global Surveyor’s Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) was discovered which showed a perfectly square-shaped structure, nearly 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) wide on the planet. This geometric anomaly has sparked widespread speculation, with theories ranging from natural geological formations to potential extraterrestrial origins.The tech billionaire then urged for a direct investigation into the formation which has further fueled discussions about the structure’s significance. Replying to podcaster Joe Rogan’s post that showed the square structure on Mars, Musk wrote: “We should send astronauts to Mars to investigate!”Meanwhile, SpaceX's Mars colonization ambitions encountered a hurdle following the explosion of its Starship vehicle during the eighth test flight in March 2025. This failure, the second in just two months, highlighted the substantial technical challenges that stand between Elon Musk's timeline and the reality of Mars exploration.The March test initially showed promise when the Super Heavy booster successfully landed. However, the mission ended in disaster after multiple Raptor engines on the upper stage malfunctioned.",Elon Musk shared a post on X announcing that SpaceX will launch a Starship carrying Optimus explorer robots to Mars by the end of 2026.

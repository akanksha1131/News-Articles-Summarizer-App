“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.","Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids.

Nvidia is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire the prominent Israeli startup AI21 Labs for a sum estimated between $2 billion and $3 billion. Negotiations are said to have reached an advanced stage as the American chip giant moves to consolidate its dominance in the global artificial intelligence (AI) sector.Citing a report by the Calcalist financial daily, news agency Reuters reported that the acquisition will mark a significant exit for the Tel Aviv-based firm, which was valued at $1.4 billion during a 2023 funding round. The report further said that industry insiders suggest that Nvidia’s primary motivation for the deal is a “talent grab”. The company employs about 200 people and a majority of these hold advanced academic degrees.These employees are seen as possessing “rare expertise” in large language model (LLM) development and neural network architecture – something that tech giants are hunting for in the Silicon Valley. AI21 Labs was co-founded in 2017 by Amnon Shashua, who also serves as the CEO of autonomous driving leader Mobileye.The startup has long been a key player in the generative AI boom, positioning its ""Jurassic"" models as direct competitors to OpenAI’s GPT series, the report said.The potential acquisition aligns with Nvidia's physical and strategic expansion within Israel.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on 'China ban'





Nvidia has a message for Americans: US export control is hurting you all. The company said this in a statement to the comment of White House AI czar David Sacks. “They’re rejecting our chips,” Sacks said in an interview on Bloomberg Tech, citing an unspecified news article he had seen that day. “Apparently they don’t want them, and I think the reason for that is they want semiconductor independence.” Later in a social media post, Sacks said that he was referring to a Financial Times report that China was poised to limit access to the chips via a local approval process where Chinese buyers would need to justify their purchases. ""This is the report I was citing. It would be more accurate to attribute this news to FT than to me.""Responding to David Sacks comments and the report an Nvidia spokesperson said that the company continues to work with the administration on H200 licenses for vetted customers. “While we do not yet have results to report, it’s clear that three years of overbroad export controls fueled America’s foreign competitors and cost US taxpayers billions of dollars,” the company said.Quoting sources in China, the Financial Times report claimed that regulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia’s second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips.It further added that buyers would probably be required to go through an approval process, submitting requests to purchase the chips and explaining why domestic providers were unable to meet their needs. The people added that no final decision had been made yet.This is not the first time that Nvidia has expressed disappointment in China rejecting its chips. In September this year too, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang weighed in on the US tech giant’s struggles in China after a report claimed that the country has banned its AI chips. Huang said that he was “disappointed” after reports that the Cyberspace Administration of China had ordered companies including TikTok parent company ByteDance and Alibaba not to buy Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D, an Nvidia chip that was made for China. In response to a question, Huang said that “we can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be.”Nvidia CEO Huang has been lobbying with the US government for the ban to be lifted as China has used the ban to push domestic chipmakers to make products to compete with Nvidia.",White House AI czar David Sacks said in an interview that China is rejecting Nvidia's chips.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

Apple's $1 million Developer Academy in US comes under question five years after launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apples-1-million-developer-academy-in-us-comes-under-question-five-years-after-launch/articleshow/126255405.cms,"Apple's Detroit Developer Academy, costing nearly $30 million, faces scrutiny over job placement claims. While some graduates secure full-time roles and launch businesses, attendance is lower than projected. The program, offering free training and stipends, aims to boost tech careers, but its overall effectiveness is under debate.

What are the concerns about Apple’s Detroit Developer Academy





The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit is facing questions about its effectiveness and value. A recent investigative report has suggested that the expensive programme may not be delivering on its job placement promises. However, the whole picture appears more complicated. According to a Wired investigation, the academy programme could have performed better for all involved, though the accuracy of this assessment remains unclear. Apple launched the Detroit academy in January 2021 as part of its Racial Equality and Justice Initiative. Created in partnership with Michigan State University, the programme was designed to provide software developer training to help participants find employment in the tech field.The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit has cost nearly $30 million over four years, raising questions about whether the programme is worth the investment.Apple contributed about $11.6 million, or roughly a third of the total cost. The Gilbert Family Foundation, run by billionaire Dan Gilbert, pledged $11 million over five years. Michigan taxpayers and Michigan State University covered about 30% of the costs, including $6 million in taxpayer funds used for student stipends, the report notes.The programme initially hoped to help about 1,000 students per year. However, only a few hundred people actually attend each year. The agreement with Apple allows up to 200 students in the longer programme focused on developing apps for the App Store. About 50 students are invited back for a second year to work with local organisations.The courses are completely free and include iPhones and MacBooks. The estimated cost is about $20,000 per student, which is nearly twice the per-student budget for community colleges. Students also receive monthly stipends ranging from $800 to $1,500. Some students said the stipends helped them clear debt and move out of their parents' homes, while others still needed side jobs.About 70% of students graduate, which Michigan State Academy of Leadership leader Sarah Gretter says is higher than typical for adult education. Of those graduates, approximately 71% moved on to full-time jobs over the last two years. This is consistent with other vocational training programmes, which typically see hiring rates between 70% and 80%. Additionally, the academy’s alumni have developed 13 businesses and 62 apps.Although the results are mixed, the value that Apple sees in the academies has allowed them to open multiple locations around the world. As of 2024, the company has added training for artificial intelligence and machine learning to the curriculum.","The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit has cost nearly $30 million over four years, raising questions about whether the programme is worth the investment.

SoftBank completes its commitment to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI for which it sold Nvidia shares worth $5.83 billion: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/softbank-completes-its-commitment-to-chatgpt-maker-openai-for-which-it-sold-nvidia-shares-worth-5-83-billion-report/articleshow/126256127.cms,"Sam Altman, CEO, OpenAI and Masayoshi Son, CEO, SoftBank

Why Softbank has invested in OpenAI



SoftBank sold Nvidia stocks to fund OpenAI



‘Didn’t want to sell a single share’: Son







Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank has reportedly fulfilled its staggering $40 billion investment commitment to OpenAI , the company that developed ChatGPT, a report has said. Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNBC claims that the final tranche of the deal was transferred last week. It is reportedly valued between $22 billion and $22.5 billion, and follows a $10 billion and a previous $8 billion direct investment. With the investment, SoftBank’s total ownership in the Microsoft-backed company is now over 10%.The capital infusion values OpenAI at a $260 billion pre-money valuation. A large portion of the investment is slated to support Project Stargate, a massive AI infrastructure joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle that was announced earlier this year. Meanwhile, OpenAI has struck partnerships with several companies, including Nvidia and AMD for high-end GPUs and AI accelerators; Broadcom for custom silicon; and Oracle for cloud capacity and data centre scaling.Notably, this $40 billion milestone required significant portfolio maneuvering. Last month, SoftBank liquidated its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia. It also sold its stake in T-Mobile T-Mobile for $9.17 billion.According to SoftBank’s chief financial officer, Yoshimitsu Goto the company “can still maintain financial strength.”“So through those options and tools we make sure that we are ready for funding in a very safe manner,” he said. SoftBank also recently acquired data centre investment firm DigitalBridge for $4 billion, further strengthening its physical AI footprint.Earlier this month, Son also revealed that he did not want to sell any Nvidia share but had to because he needed money to fund OpenAI and other projects. He said he “was crying” when he sold the company’s stake in Nvidia and the move was driven purely by the need to raise capital for AI investments.“I don’t want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects,” Son said during the event, adding, “I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.”","SoftBank has reportedly fulfilled its $40 billion investment commitment to OpenAI.

""China currently leads the United States in the early commercialisation of humanoid robots. While both countries are expected to build similarly large markets over time, China is scaling more rapidly in this initial phase.""

How China is pushing humanoid robot technology

""China's push into humanoid robotics development is driven by a combination of addressing demographic pressures, driving the next horizon of economic growth, and strengthening its role in global competition,""

""China could be the most important market for humanoids,""





Chinese companies are likely to beat Tesla in producing humanoid robots at scale. Several Chinese companies are expected to begin ramping up production of these robots in 2026. This comes even as the world’s richest man has positioned humanoid robots as central to Tesla's future valuation, which he believes could reach tens of trillions of dollars. Meanwhile, Beijing has reportedly placed humanoid robot technology at the centre of its strategic plans, giving Chinese companies an advantage in the race to commercialise the technology.In an email to CNBC, Andreas Brauchle, partner at consultancy Horváth, said:Tesla has yet to sell its flagship humanoid robot, Optimus, despite Musk highlighting it as a key part of the company's value proposition this year. Humanoid robots are designed to be shaped like humans and to move like humans. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms leverage their capabilities, along with complex hardware such as semiconductors. Supporters say they could be used in various settings, from factories to hospitality and even in homes.China has made robotics a significant part of its tech strategy in recent years, creating plans for supply chains and mass production of humanoid robots. Chinese President Xi Jinping and top leaders met in October and released proposals for the country's next five-year plan. The document mentioned ""embodied artificial intelligence"", a term that refers to AI-driven hardware like robotics or driverless cars.For China, humanoid robots offer a way to address labour challenges in the world's second-largest economy and advance Beijing's push for tech leadership.Karel Eloot, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, told CNBC.China's birth rate is declining, and its population is ageing, reducing the workforce and raising labour costs. Robots are seen as a solution.Meanwhile, China is competing with the US in a tech race across multiple sectors. Robotics could become a new battleground in 2026. Politico reported this month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been meeting with robotics company CEOs to develop a plan to accelerate the industry. Washington is considering issuing an executive order on robotics next year, according to Politico.RBC Capital Markets said in a note this month. Analysts forecast a global market for humanoids of $9 trillion by 2050, with China accounting for more than 60%.Chinese robotics companies are moving ahead with mass production. Unitree, which is preparing for an IPO that could value it at around $7 billion, is one of China's leading robotics players.","China has made robotics a significant part of its tech strategy in recent years.

Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is expected to reject the massive $108.4 billion offer from Paramount-Skydance, according to a CNBC report. The reported snub comes despite a personal intervention from Oracle founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, who offered a personal guarantee of $40 billion to secure the financing for the deal.The means that signals that WBD’s board remains committed to a rival $82.7 billion cash-and-stock deal with Netflix, prioritising ‘deal certainty’ over higher price offered by Paramount-Skydance.Earlier this month, WBD claimed that Paramount misled the company, saying that it had backing by Ellisons. They demanded a ‘signature on the dotted line’ from Larry Ellison, and in an effort to erase those doubts, Paramount-Skydance brought in the financial firepower with the tech mogul offered to personally guarantee the equity financing.How two offers stand against each other:Paramount-Skydance has offered $108.4 billion (Hostile bid) which includes a $30-per-share all-cash value and a raised regulatory termination fee. Netflix has offered $82.7 billion friendly bid – a lower face value but perceived by analysts as having a cleaner financing structure and lower execution risk.Despite the sweetened terms from the Ellison-backed bid, WBD’s board has expressed persistent concerns because in case of rejection, WBD would be forced to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion breakup fee.Furthermore, a merger with Paramount would create a studio entity larger than Disney – a move that has already drawn the attention of antitrust regulators.President Donald Trump has indicated he plans to be personally involved in the landmark acquisition, and has hinted that the deal may attract antitrust scrutiny.If WBD rejects Paramount’s offer, Netflix may emerge as the biggest streaming giant, at the same time, potentially ending one of the most expensive hostile takeover attempts in entertainment history, the report said.","Warner Bros.

Tech companies now looking to develop of robots globally





In what can be called as ‘engineering meets Bollywood fever’, a robot’s dance at IIT Bombay Techfest 2025 this week has stolen the show. A humanoid robot danced to the viral track from the Ranveer Singh-starrer Dhurandhar, FA9LA. The song, composed by Bahraini rap artist Flipperachi, echoed through the arena as the robot moved in sync with the music.In the performance on the Arabic beat, which has since gone viral across social media, the humanoid robot tries to mirror the energy associated with Akshaye Khanna’s character in the film, essentially demonstrated the fusion of technology into a pop-culture. The robot demonstrated balance and fluid movements, leaving the audience of tech enthusiasts and students surprised.Robotics has captured pace with global tech giants working to develop humanoid robotics as industry pivots from pure software to the physical embodiment of AI. The first name that comes to layman’s mind is Elon Musk whose company Tesla is developing Optimus. Optimus is being positioned as a general-purpose worker capable of performing “unsafe, repetitive, or boring” tasks. This pat year, Musk has already showcased Optimus’ several abilities, such as folding clothes and dancing.Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has identified the next growth opportunity: robotics. Huang told company shareholders that he sees robotics as the chipmaker's largest potential market beyond AI.""We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest,"" Huang stated, as per CNBC.""We're working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,"" Huang added.Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis is also focused on the ultimate prize: the ‘digital brain’. Google's AI division recently hired former Boston Dynamics executive Aaron Saunders as its vice president of hardware engineering. The latest hiring suggests a significant move into robotics.","A humanoid robot danced to the viral track from the Ranveer Singh-starrer Dhurandhar, FA9LA.

China adds new rule for chipmakers as part of its 'Whole Nation' approach and the 'reason' once again is America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-adds-new-rule-for-chipmakers-as-part-of-its-whole-nation-approach-and-the-reason-once-again-is-america/articleshow/126254646.cms,"Representative Image

How US pushed China to bring ‘new chipmaking rule’



China plans to use 100% domestic equipment







China has reportedly issued a new mandate under which domestic chipmakers will be required to source at least 50% of their equipment from local suppliers. Insiders describe the move as a core component of President Xi Jinping’s ‘Whole Nation’ approach to technology, and it is seen as is a direct response to tightening US export restrictions that have sought to cripple China’s computing capabilities.According to news agency Reuters, the rule remains a “silent” policy (which means undocumented in public records), industry sources say that chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand plants must now prove they meet the 50% threshold through procurement tenders.“Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%. Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment,” Reuters quoted one source as saying.Historically, Chinese fabs such as SMIC have preferred American or Japanese equipment. However, the 2023 US export bans on advanced AI chips and tools shifted China’s stance from encouraging domestic growth to mandating it.“Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance. But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers,” a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology was quoted as saying.The Reuters report has also said that while the government allows “flexibility” for advanced production lines where local alternatives do not yet exist, China’s ultimate goal is total independence. The “Whole Nation” effort is reportedly producing technical milestones, for example, Chinese scientists are said to be prototyping indigenous machines capable of cutting-edge lithography.This requirement is effectively squeezing global competitors out of the world’s largest semiconductor market, the report said, adding that Chinese firms like Naura and AMEC are already improve through forced domestic partnership. Meanwhile, foreign players like Lam Research and Tokyo Electron now face a shaky footprint in China.",China has reportedly issued a new mandate under which domestic chipmakers will be required to source at least 50% of their equipment from local suppliers.

Read Alex Spiro’s full getter to California Governor Gavin Newsom



Re: Constitutional Concerns Regarding Proposed Billionaire Tax Act

Dear Governor Newsom:

I represent California residents who would be subject to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act if it qualifies for the November 2026 ballot. I write to urge you to work to prevent this initiative from moving forward. The Act has serious legal problems and would cause significant economic damage to California and the broader economy.

First, and most importantly, the Act would be unconstitutional. Although the Act purports to be a tax, it is in reality an uncompensated confiscation of property. The Act imposes a 5% levy on total accumulated wealth, including illiquid assets that generate no income. That is in substance a taking without just compensation. As the Supreme Court explained in Armstrong v. United States, the government cannot force ""some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole."" 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960). The Act concentrates an extraordinary burden on a small group to solve a general revenue problem— exactly what the Constitution prohibits.

Second, for the people who relocate from California in 2026 before the November election, the Act would tax them after they have become citizens of other States and without any ability to vote on the measure. The Supreme Court has held that retroactive taxation cannot be ""harsh and oppressive."" United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 30 (1994). A 5% levy on total net worth imposed on former residents who departed before the law was even enacted clearly meets that definition.

Third, the Act's unprecedented novelty makes it especially vulnerable to a legal challenge. California has never imposed a wealth tax, much less one that reaches former residents and that is targeted at a small group of citizens. The Supreme Court closely scrutinizes unprecedented exercises of government power precisely because they lack historical precedent. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 505 (2023). In fact, it has not hesitated to invalidate the retroactive application of new taxes, even for far less extreme measures. See Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142 (1927). There can be no doubt that the current Supreme Court would carefully evaluate a law so out of step with the American legal tradition.

From an economic perspective, the Act creates two serious problems. First, it will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California. Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax. They are not alone. See California's wealth-tax test: Have voters finally found a policy that the state's inherent economic strengths can't overcome?, Wash. Post (Nov. 17, 2025) (opinion) (describing the tax as ""almost tailor-made to drive most Silicon Valley tech companies to Austin, Texas""). In other words, by passing this proposal California would exchange a one-time windfall for the permanent loss of billions in annual income taxes, capital gains taxes, property taxes, and economic activity. The state's most economically productive residents would take their businesses, jobs, and charitable giving with them. Second, the Act will force destructive asset sales. Our clients hold equity stakes in operating businesses, venture capital funds, and real estate. Paying a 5% wealth tax would require massive forced liquidations, depressing asset values and triggering market instability that would harm ordinary investors whose retirement accounts hold these same investments.

Our clients are prepared to mount a vigorous constitutional challenge if this measure advances. Litigation would be protracted and expensive, and it would generate sustained negative attention to California's business climate. The prudent course is to prevent this constitutionally defective measure from reaching the ballot. We respectfully ask that you discourage signature gathering, oppose qualification, and if necessary, campaign against passage.

Our clients prefer to remain in California and continue contributing to the state's economy and civic life. But they will not remain if subjected to an unconstitutional confiscation of their wealth. We hope this can be resolved through political channels rather than through years of contentious litigation.

Respectfully,

Alex Spiro





Alex Spiro, a high-profile attorney who has represented tech leaders like Elon Musk and WeWork founder Adam Neumann, has issued an ultimatum to California governor Gavin Newsom: If the proposed “Billionaire Tax Act” is passed, the state’s wealthiest residents will move out. He sent the ‘warning’ in a letter to the governor, saying that his clients have made it clear that they will leave California and won’t come back, describing the move as a certain “exodus of capital and innovation.”The issue centres around a proposed Billionaire Tax Act that mandates a one-time 5% tax on the total assets of residents worth more than $1 billion. If it gathers enough signatures, it will appear on the November 2026 ballot.Spiro’s letter comes days after Newsom publicly stated he is against the wealth tax and would “fight” it. Meanwhile, Palmer Luckey, the Oculus founder took to X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend to blast the measure. Furthermore, venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google co-founder Larry Page have reportedly looked into moving out of the state.","California Gov.

As the year comes to an end, we take a look back at the Indian startup ecosystem. 2025 proved to be a far more resilient year as compared to 2024 for the Indian startup ecosystem. According to the data by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), this year around 730 startups shut down. Yet, behind the numbers lie some of the most recognisable names in tech and consumer internet that couldn’t survive mounting financial strain, regulatory hurdles, or competitive pressures. From EV ride-hailing pioneer BluSmart to hyperlocal delivery trailblazer Dunzo, the year reminded entrepreneurs that even well-funded, high-profile startups are not immune to failure.Here are some of the major tech startups that witnessed complete shut down this year.Reliance-backed hyperlocal delivery platform Dunzo was shut down this year. Despite raising $240 million from Reliance Retail in 2022, the startup failed to survive and scummed to the pressure of mounting debt, failed IPL sponsorship and the inability to compete against rivals like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto and Blanket. By September, co-founder Kabeer Biswas exited to join Flipkart’s quick-commerce arm Minutes, effectively ending Dunzo’s journey.BluSmart, the electric ride-hailing service once seen as a challenger to Uber and Ola abruptly shut down in April this year. SEBI investigation found out about a large-scale fraud at Gensol Engineering, promoted by BluSmart’s founders. Though Gensol held no equity in BluSmart, it owned much of its EV fleet, creating deep financial linkages. Allegations of siphoning ₹262 crore, forged documents, and misused funds triggered a collapse. BluSmart suspended operations and transitioned its fleet to Uber, sending shockwaves through India’s cleantech sector.Kavin Bharti Mittal, founder and CEO of Hike announced the shut down of the popular gaming and messaging app in September this year. In a long LinkedIn post, Mittal announced that app is shutting down globally. In a reflective post titled “Closing a Chapter, Opening a New One”, Mittal cited shifting market dynamics and regulatory challenges as key reasons behind the decision. The shut down of Hike wasfollowed by the recent online real-money gaming ban imposed by the Indian government. Hike pivoted from its original messaging app to real money gaming in 2021. Mittal acknowledged that after the imposed ban it was not the best decision to keep on investing in the platform.Beauty and content commerce startup Good Glamm Group also shut its operations this year. Once valued near unicorn status, the startup tried to replicate the roll-up ecommerce model by acquiring multiple beauty and personal care brands. However, heavy debt, stalled growth, and failed synergies led to the winding down of brands like Sirona and The Mom’s Co.The startup was founded by ex-Blinkit CTO Varun Khurana during the time of the pandemic. The startup connected consumers directly with farmers via resellers. Despite raising $44.2 million, the startup was overwhelmed by the rise of 10-minute delivery services. Cash flow issues, delayed salaries, and vendor dues culminated in its shutdown in May this year.","This year around 730 startups shut down in India.

Blinkit CFO Vipin Kapooria to rejoin Flipkart after spending over a year with Zomato-owned company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/blinkit-cfo-vipin-kapooria-to-rejoin-flipkart-after-spending-over-a-year-with-zomato-owned-company/articleshow/126252540.cms,"Flipkart entered quick commerce last year to compete with Blinkit







Blinkit's chief financial officer (CFO), Vipin Kapooria, has resigned. He is returning to Flipkart in a senior finance role, the Economic Times reported. The report cited people familiar with the matter to make this claim. Kapooria spent just over a year at the quick-commerce company after joining in September 2024. Kapooria joined Gurugram-based Blinkit from Flipkart, where he was a vice president of finance. This will be his third stint at Flipkart. He first joined the Bengaluru-based company in 2015, left for the hospitality startup Oyo in 2018, returned in 2020, and then joined Blinkit. Kapooria was Blinkit's first full-time CFO in two years. The position had been vacant since 2022, when Amit Sachdeva, Blinkit's former finance chief, quit after Zomato (now Eternal) acquired the company.Flipkart entered the 10-minute delivery space in mid-2024 and is preparing for a public listing next year. The company is currently in the final stages of moving its base from Singapore to India.For Eternal-owned Blinkit, which competes with Zepto, Swiggy's Instamart, Flipkart Minutes, and Amazon Now, Kapooria joined just before the parent company raised Rs 8,500 crore through a qualified institutional placement last year.He worked closely with Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa and Eternal CFO Akshant Goyal.The quick commerce sector has seen significant fundraising over the last 12-14 months. Swiggy raised Rs 14,500 crore through an IPO in November 2024 and a QIP earlier this month.

Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring. Alexandr Wang, the head of the team and Chief AI officer of Meta, has announced that the company is hiring for its team in Singapore. This comes hours after the social media giant acquired Manus AI, a Singapore-based company working on AI agents.“MSL is hiring in Singapore! We already have some amazing researchers and engineers there, buoyed now by the 100-strong Manus team, and we’re growing fast,” Wang said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“Feel free to DM with a resumé if interested!,” he added.In November this year, Wang announced that the company is laying off approximately 600 positions from its Meta Superintelligence Labs division, and those employees were placed on a non-working notice period.“By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote in his memo to staff members, as per Business Insider and CNBC.The company said that affected employees would receive 16 weeks of severance plus two additional weeks for every completed year of service, minus the notice period.“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort.Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.","Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring.

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Meta makes it third largest acquisition





Economist Dean Baker has criticized Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he threw “$77 billion … into the toilet” with his bet on Metaverse. The economist published a newsletter where he called Meta’s $77 billion investment into Meta's virtual reality push a “stupid” investment decision. The newsletter titled “Did Mark Zuckerberg Throw $77 Billion of Our Money into the Toilet?” argues that Meta's Metaverse ambitions can be viewed as “just a mistaken investment decision, of the sort companies make all the time”. However, “the flip side to this story is that when companies make stupid investment decisions, as it seems Zuckerberg did with the $77 billion he threw into Meta, it is not just a loss on their books, but also a cost to society,” Baker writes.He stated that software engineers, planners and support staff were tied up in the project, alongside physical inputs such as office space, computing equipment and electricity. This, Baker argues “could have otherwise been productively employed,” suggesting even the construction materials used for Meta's expansion could have instead supported “affordable housing in the expensive Bay Area.”Baker, who co-founded the Center for Economic and Policy Research, warned that the AI investment boom is reshaping the US economy by fueling growth and absorbing talent.However, it places heavy strain on power grids, which further complicates climate goals.In another news, Facebook-parent Meta has announced the acquisition of artificial intelligence startup Manus which has Chinese roots. As reported by Financial Times, Meta has made its third largest acquisition deal after WhatsApp and ScaleAI. This move of the company underscores CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive push into advanced AI as the company is racing to compete against Google and OpenAI. In a statement, Meta said, it will “operate and sell the Manus service” while integrating its technology into products such as the Meta AI chatbot. For those unaware, Manus is known as one of the best autonomous general-purpose agents and is also capable of performing tasks like market research, coding and data analysis.",Economist Dean Baker has criticized Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he threw “$77 billion … into the toilet” with his bet on Metaverse.

Stranger Things 5 Volume 2 X Review: Fans divided over stellar performance and plot predictability

Elon Musk’s history of Netflix criticism





Streaming giant Netflix is all set to close the year 2025 with the final instalment of its blockbuster series Stranger Things, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has joined the club of fans who are expressing their dissatisfaction with one of the show’s concluding plot lines. The second part of Stranger Things season five premiered on Christmas Day. The season got millions of views and added to the record-breaking momentum of the final season.The storyline of the final season included an important and pivotal momment where the character of Will Byers comes out to his friends, admitting, ““The truth is. I am different. I just pretended like I wasn’t because I didn’t want to be. I don’t like girls.” While many of the Stranger Things fans loved and welcomed the moment, there are many who criticised it online and called it forced. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also one of its critics.One of the fan of Stranger Things took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to talk about the moment. An X user named @Antunes1 wrote, “Stranger Things fans are criticizing a character for coming out as homosexual in the season finale, calling it was completely unnecessary for the plot.The culture is changing.”Replying to his post Musk said, “It’s completely unnecessary and forced on audiences who just want to enjoy some basic sci-fi.”This is not the first time that Elon Musk has criticised Netflix. In October this year, Musk cancelled his Netflix subscription. The move came after the streaming platform employed Hamish Steele, a director who allegedly mocked the killing of right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk. “Just cancelled my Netflix subscription. If you employ someone who celebrated the murder of Charlie Kirk and makes content that pushes pro-trans content on my kids. ....you will NEVER get a dime of my money. It's as simple as that,” an X (formerly Twitter) user wrote on X. Elon Musk replied to the user writing “same”, confirming the cancellation.Despite Musk’s comments, Netflix is ending 2025 on a high note. The first four episodes of Stranger Things season five, released November 26, garnered 59.6 million views in their first week. The final episode will premiere on New Year’s Eve, including screenings in more than 500 movie theaters across the U.S","Elon Musk has labelled Will Byers' coming-out moment as ""unnecessary and forced"" Musk recently cancelled his Netflix subscription in protest against certain content choices.

China aims to break Starlink’s monopoly





Chinese authorities recently penalised a foreign vessel for illegally using Starlink within Chinese waters. According to a South China Morning Post report, the satellite-based internet service offered by Elon Musk ’s SpaceX – is banned in China and is viewed as a national security threat. In fact, the company has not been given licence to operate in the country. As a result, vessels equipped with Starlink terminals are required to stop using them when they enter Chinese territory.China has a series of laws and regulations that prohibits foreign companies from operating basic telecoms services in the country. This includes satellite-based internet service.Further, satellite communication within the country must be routed through a domestic gateway. Also, any company or individual using radio devices or frequencies within China must obtain an official approval.Elon Musk’s Starlink service, which is essentially a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites, has not been granted this permission in China. According to an AP report, Chinese researchers believe that Starlink “poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests” as Starlink’s communications are routed through overseas gateways rather than domestic infrastructure.The news agency quoted a 2023 paper published by the China’s National University of Defense Technology which said “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains.”The US-based SpaceX currently holds a monopoly in the satellite internet connectivity technology. According to its latest data, Starlink operates in more than 140 countries. In June this year, the company obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns in the country.SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket model that the company uses regularly to launch and put satellites into orbit. China’s private rocket firm LandSpace carried out a full reusable rocket test with the launch of its new Zhuque-3 model earlier this month.

Google shares jump 60%-plus this year, powered by Gemini and more





If the biggest news of 2025 is Artificial Intelligence (AI) going mainstream, it is also Google leading the AI war, and at the expense of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI . Almost three years ago, Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a 'Code Red' message to employees across the company over ChatGPT, with Pichai warning it could threaten the future of Search. Late 2025 saw Sam Altman sound an alarm of his own -- this time over Google’s Gemini 3 comeback. Sam Altman's 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees came just days after Google released its latest model, Gemini 3, in one of its fastest rollouts across a large swath of Google’s ecosystem with its billions of users. Analysts termed Gemini 3 rollout as its fastest-ever deployment into Google Search.And as the new data from Similarweb reveals: There's a dramatic reshaping in the AI landscape. In the last 12 months, Google's Gemini has reportedly more than tripled its slice of generative AI web traffic, climbing from a modest 5.4% to 18.2%. This surge in traffic is said to have come directly at the expense of OpenAI's ChatGPT. As per Similarweb data, ChatGPT has seen its hold on the market loosen significantly -- once commanding an 87.2% share, ChatGPT has slid to 68%, which is a staggering 19% drop.Solid Finance CEO Sam Badawi said, in a post on Twitter, ""THE SHIFT IS REAL. GOOGLE IS TAKING AI TRAFFIC. $GOOGL Gemini has gone from 5.4% to 18.2% of Gen AI web traffic in 12 months.That is not noise, that is a takeover arc. Nearly +13 points of share in a category that was once considered dominated by OpenAI."" He further noted, ""If you believe web behavior reflects user preference at scale, then this is the clearest signal that [Google] is not only in the game, it is winning share. ""Also, as per a recent report by Menlo Ventures, in the lucrative market for enterprise customers, OpenAI appears to have lost significant market share, falling to 27%, while Gemini has risen to 21% and rival startup Anthropic leads at 40%. Incidentally, the ChatGPT-maker disputes the figures from Menlo, noting that the venture capital company is an investor in Anthropic.Wall Street too seems to have given Google's Gemini success a huge applause. Shares of Google-parent Alphabet are on track to become the best annual performer within the ""Magnificent Seven"" for the first time, gaining 65.6% since the beginning of the year. Adoption of Gemini has become a key signal for Google’s position in the AI race. Bank of America’s Justin Post wrote in a December note that “we see potential for Gemini to be seen as a demand generator for Search and Google Cloud. ” Google's image-editing tool Nano Banana, released in September, too helped Gemini climb in popularity earlier this year.In its third quarter earnings, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced that its Gemini app now has 650 million monthly active users, up from 450 million in July.","Google's Gemini has reportedly more than tripled its slice of generative AI web traffic, climbing from a modest 5.4% to 18.2%.

AI can predict crime patterns earlier than humans; here’s what the study says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-can-predict-crime-patterns-earlier-than-humans-heres-what-the-study-says/articleshow/126246748.cms,"How does the AI predict crime and how accurate is it

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

What data was used and why

What did the study reveal about police response

Why do older crime models fall short

Could this tool change policing

Does it work beyond one city





Crime rarely arrives without warning, yet it often feels sudden when it appears on a street or block. Patterns exist, though they are not always easy to see from the ground. In many cities, people sense that some areas receive faster attention than others when trouble happens. That feeling usually stays anecdotal, passed along in conversation rather than backed by numbers. Research led by scientists at the University of Chicago takes a closer look at this quiet imbalance. By using publicly available crime data, the team built a computer model that can forecast where crime is likely to occur up to a week ahead. Alongside prediction, it highlights something less expected. Police response does not rise evenly across neighbourhoods, even when crime does.The model focuses on time and place rather than labels. Instead of relying on neighbourhood names or district borders, it divides a city into small squares roughly a thousand feet wide. Each reported crime becomes a point in time and space.By studying how these points cluster and repeat, the system learns local patterns. It does not assume crime spreads like a disease or shockwave. It looks for quieter signals, such as how one event increases the chance of another nearby, days later.Using this approach, the model predicted reported violent and property crimes about a week in advance with close to 90% accuracy in several large US cities.The research relied on crimes that are more consistently reported to police. These included homicides, assaults, burglaries, thefts, and vehicle thefts. Such crimes tend to appear in official records even in places where trust in police is low.Offences like drug possession or traffic stops were left out. Those categories are more closely tied to enforcement choices and can distort patterns. By narrowing the focus, the researchers aimed to reduce built-in bias within the data itself.Alongside crime prediction, the team examined what happened after crimes were reported. They compared arrest rates across neighbourhoods with different income levels.A clear difference emerged. When crime occurred in wealthier areas, arrests increased. In less advantaged areas, similar levels of crime did not lead to the same rise in arrests. In some cases, arrest rates even dropped. This suggests that police resources are pulled toward affluent neighbourhoods during periods of higher demand.One of the researchers noted that when the system is under pressure, it appears to prioritise areas that already receive more attention.Many prediction tools focus on hotspots that spread outward. These approaches often ignore how cities actually function. Streets, transport routes, and social boundaries shape movement in ways simple maps cannot capture.The model developed here accounts for those realities. It reflects how people travel, where they gather, and how communication flows through areas with similar economic backgrounds. This allows it to uncover connections that traditional methods miss.The researchers are careful about how the model should be used. High accuracy does not mean police should flood predicted areas in advance. That approach risks deepening existing inequalities.Instead, the system can act as a simulation tool. Policymakers can test what might happen if crime rises in one area or enforcement increases in another. It offers a way to see how decisions ripple through a city before they are made on the street.The model was tested using data from Chicago and then applied to seven other US cities, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. It performed at similar levels across all of them.This suggests that while each city has its own patterns, the underlying approach travels well.The research does not promise fairness or safety on its own. It simply shows what is already happening, quietly, in the data. Once seen, it becomes harder to ignore.","Computer model can forecast where crime is likely to occur up to a week ahead.

Big Tech Bets Big On India: Silicon Valley's Billion Dollar AI Push Snubs Trump's 'America First'

The tax that's got billionaires running for the exit

A battle over who built Silicon Valley





Tech billionaires Peter Thiel and Google co-founder Larry Page are reportedly preparing to cut ties with California before the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve, driven by fears of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1 billion. he venture capitalist and Google co-founder have called the Golden State home for years, but sources familiar with their thinking say both are exploring exit strategies as the wealth tax proposal gains momentum—even though it hasn't yet qualified for the November 2026 ballot.Sources told the New York Times that Thiel, who owns a Hollywood Hills mansion and runs his personal investment firm Thiel Capital from Los Angeles, has been scouting locations for a new office in another state while planning to spend more time outside California. Page, a longtime Palo Alto resident, has discussed leaving by year's end, with three limited liability companies linked to him recently filing incorporation documents in Florida. If the measure passes and applies retroactively to anyone living in California on January 1, 2026, Page could face a tax bill exceeding $12 billion on his estimated $258 billion net worth, while Thiel would owe more than $1.2 billion on his $27.5 billion fortune.The wealth tax proposal, pushed by healthcare union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, would retroactively apply to anyone living in California on January 1, 2026. That means billionaires have just hours to establish residency elsewhere if they want to avoid it. For Page, whose net worth stands at roughly $258 billion, the tax bill could exceed $12 billion. Thiel, worth about $27.5 billion, would face a tab of more than $1.2 billion.The measure needs enough signatures to reach the November 2026 ballot, but some wealthy Californians aren't willing to gamble. Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya warned the tax would trigger ""an exodus of the state's most talented entrepreneurs,"" adding he's giving ""serious consideration"" to moving to Texas.Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, dismissed the billionaire flight threats with sarcasm, echoing FDR's response to wealthy industrialists during the New Deal: ""I will miss them very much."" Khanna argued that public funding—not just entrepreneurial genius—built the tech industry, and that a modest wealth tax won't stop innovation.But tech founders aren't buying it. Palmer Luckey, co-founder of defense tech startup Anduril, warned the tax could force founders to sell company stakes or face wage garnishment. ""One market correction and I'm screwed for life,"" he wrote.California Gov. Gavin Newsom has come out against the measure, warning it'll drive wealthy residents to lower-tax states like Texas and Florida.","Peter Thiel and Larry Page are reportedly planning to leave California before year-end.

He emphasized that a strong mathematical background is crucial for adapting to significant technological shifts, particularly in the evolving AI landscape.

Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun to step down

“As many of you have heard through rumors or recent media articles, I am planning to leave Meta after 12 years: 5 years as founding director of FAIR and 7 years as Chief AI Scientist.

The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular. The creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment.

I am creating a startup company to continue the

Advanced Machine Intelligence

research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond. The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.

I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth, Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years. Because of their continued interest and support, Meta will be a partner of the new company.

As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta’s commercial interests, but many of which do not. Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.

I will give some more details about the new company when the time comes. In the meantime, I’m sticking around Meta until the end of the year.”





Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who is leaving the company at the end of the year, recently advised computer science students to spend their time wisely and “learn things with a longer shelf life”. Else, they may find out their degree doesn't add up, reports Business Insider. In an email statement to the publication, LeCun said “If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts”. LeCun shared similar views during his appearance on the ""The Information Bottleneck"" podcast.Yann LeCun, who is a computer science student at New York University, said on the podcast:“What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality. You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera.”Adding more about why learning computer science in the era of AI is important, he said “Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers. And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this”.Earlier this year, Yann LeCun announced to leave the company after 12 years. He then shared a long LinkedIn post writing:","Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, is leaving the company at the end of the year.

Reports suggest that the iPhone 16 was among the highest-selling devices during the sale. With just three months remaining, one can easily say that iPhone 16 is the most-popular iPhone of 2025.The iPhone 16 led the market and maintained the first position for the third consecutive quarter. Thanks to a sales boost in India driven by festive promotions and sustained recovery in Japan, the iPhone 16 was able to restrict the iPhone 16 series’ seasonal decline due to the iPhone 17 series launch.Apple’s operations in India stood out once again for the US tech and electronics major which set an all-time revenue record in the country just as it clocked an 8% growth in global revenues — at $102.5 billion, led by “a tremendous response” to the new iPhone17 series and the previous-gen iPhone16.India stood out once again for its stellar performance, not just in the production of iPhones but also because of the strong revenues. “We also set a Sept quarter revenue record in emerging markets and an all-time revenue record in India,” Cook said while releasing global financial numbers.He attributed the surge to growth in the retail footprint of the company across geographies, including in India. “In the last few months, we’ve opened new stores in emerging markets like India and the UAE and new locations in the US and China.”In October this year for the first time Apple became the $4 trillion company. This milestone was followed by a surge in the company shares. As per report, Apple's shares climbed by 25% in between the month of June and August. It is said that the company witnessed this growth due to the strong sales of iPhone 17 models which were launched in September this year and reportedly out-performed their predecessors. Apart from Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft reached the $4 trillion mark in July. Nvidia’s market value has continued to rise, reaching $4.88 trillion.In a note shared with CNBC, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote: “Announcement of an increased pace of domestic investment in combination with a rapid shift in product manufacturing for the US market outside of China (India, Vietnam) has improved Apple’s positioning in the tariff landscape.”",iPhone 16 has emerged as the most-popular smartphone in India in 2025. Apple sold around 6.5 million units of iPhone 16 in the first 11 months. The report also highlights the a shift in consumer preferences in a market long dominated by entry-level and mid-range Android devices.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126247550,imgsize-22570,width-400,resizemode-4/apple-announces-price-cuts-for-iphone-16-and-iphone-16-plus-models-in-india-heres-how-much-they-cost-now.jpg"

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s AI ambitions





Facebook-parent Meta has announced the acquisition of artificial intelligence startup Manus which has Chinese roots. As reported by Financial Times, Meta has made its third largest acquisition deal after WhatsApp and ScaleAI. This move of the company underscores CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive push into advanced AI as the company is racing to compete against Google and OpenAI. In a statement, Meta said, it will “operate and sell the Manus service” while integrating its technology into products such as the Meta AI chatbot. For those unaware, Manus is known as one of the best autonomous general-purpose agents and is also capable of performing tasks like market research, coding and data analysis.Enterprises and businesses can subscribe to Manus agent by paying $20 per month. The deal is notable as a rare example of a U.S. tech giant acquiring a cutting-edge AI platform with Chinese origins, at a time when AI has become a flashpoint in China-US relations.An early investor of Manus said that the acquisition made by meta ranks behind only Meta’s $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp in 2014 and its up to $15 billion investment in Scale AI earlier this year.Manus has a staff of around 100 employees and it was once hailed as the ‘next DeepSeek’. The company also raised funding this year from US venture capital firm Benchmark.ZhenFund partner Liu Yuan has praised this move made by Meta. He said that deal highlight that the young generation of Chinese entrepreneurs has arrived. “The era belonging to this generation of young Chinese entrepreneurs has arrived.” He noted that Zuckerberg himself has long been a Manus user.The report further adds that the acquisition made by Meta could lead to a scrutiny in both Washington and Beijing. Benchmark’s earlier investment in Manus drew criticism from U.S. lawmakers who argued it violated restrictions on American groups investing in Chinese AI. Meanwhile, Manus’ relocation to Singapore led some Chinese media to label the company “defectors.”Li Chengdong, founder of the Haitun internet think-tank, warned that China risks losing ground in the AI race if it fails to value talent and respect capital rules. “An incredible company and team are being sold to the United States,” he said.Zuckerberg has described his vision as building “personal superintelligence”, pouring billions into AI infrastructure, hiring top researchers, and acquiring startups. In 2025, he recruited Alexandr Wang, the Scale AI founder, to lead Meta’s AI efforts. Wang said Meta is also expanding recruitment in Singapore, where Manus will remain based.Meta is under pressure to monetize its AI investments, with trials underway for premium subscriptions to its Meta AI assistant, offering features such as booking reservations and video creation.",Facebook-parent Meta has announced the acquisition of artificial intelligence startup Manus which has Chinese roots.

"Government warns against USSD-based call forwarding scam: What is it, how the scam works and how to stay safe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-warns-against-ussd-based-call-forwarding-scam-what-is-it-how-the-scam-works-and-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/126246036.cms,"Cybercriminals are exploiting USSD codes, disguised as delivery agents, to activate call forwarding on unsuspecting citizens' phones. This allows them to intercept bank alerts and OTPs, leading to unauthorized financial transactions and account hacking. Authorities urge the public to avoid dialing suspicious codes like *21* and to report any fraudulent activity immediately.

How USSD-based call forwarding scam works

Cybercriminals impersonate delivery or courier service agents.

They then contact citizens under the pretext of confirming or rescheduling deliveries.

Victims are then instructed to dial codes sent via SMS that begin with *21*, followed by a mobile number (belonging to a fraudster).

Dialing such USSD code automatically activates call forwarding on the victim's mobile phone.

Once call forwarding gets activated, all incoming calls from banks, payment OTP verifications, or authentication codes of WhatsApp / Telegram etc are automatically redirected to the fraudster’s phone number. This results in unauthorized financial transactions as well as WhatsApp / telegram account hacking.

How to stay safe from cyber frauds

Do Not Dial or enter any USSD code beginning with *21*, *61*, *67*, or similar prefixes shared by unknown callers.

Deactivate all forwarding: In case call forwarding is activated, dial ##002#, will instantly cancel all call forwarding services (busy, unreachable, no-answer).

Do Not Click on suspicious courier or delivery links received via SMS, WhatsApp, or email.

Verify Delivery Details directly with official courier services through their website or customer care helpline.

Report any fraudulent applications or any scam incident immediately on 1930 or www.cybercrime.gov.in





The Indian government has issued an advisory warning against USSD-based call forwarding scam. The advisory has been issued by the National Cybercrime Threat Analytics Unit of Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). According to it, cyber criminals are impersonating delivery agents to make unauthorized financial transactions from the victims’ accounts and dupe vulnerable citizens. The advisory asks citizens to take precautionary steps to avoid falling victims to such cyber frauds. It also urges them to report any fraudulent applications or any scam incident to the government.The I4C advisory explains the modus operandi of the USSD-based call forwarding scam. But first, a USSD or Unstructured Supplementary Service Data code is a special sequence of numbers, asterisks “*”and hashes “ # ” used to interact with Telecom Service Providers or access telecom services without needing an internet connection. Cyber criminals are exploiting this code to activate call forwarding on the victim's smartphone.

Satish Kumar is the Senior Director, Print Category at HP India, where he leads the company’s Print business, overseeing strategy, marketing, operations, and financial performance across consumer, commercial, and enterprise segments. With a career spanning multiple industries including information technology, distribution, logistics, music, and emerging business models, Satish brings deep expertise in sales leadership, business development, and category management. In an interaction with Times of India Tech, Satish talks about HP’s print business with special focus on MSME segment.A: Beyond cost, the defining trend we are seeing today is the growing demand for integrated technology ecosystems. MSMEs no longer look at printers in isolation, they are seeking connected, secure, and scalable solutions that work seamlessly across devices. At HP, we’re enabling this shift through the strength of our One HP portfolio, which brings together printers, PCs and a range of solutions to give MSMEs unified, end-to-end technology experience.We also work with MSMEs through contractual service models that make technology more accessible, predictable, and easier to manage.This holistic approach not only helps businesses streamline workflows and boost productivity, but also prepares them for the future of work, one that’s increasingly hybrid, digital, and driven by intelligent solutions.A: Sustainability has always been a core consideration in how we design and deliver our printing solutions. Today, it has also become a defining design and supply-chain priority across India’s printing industry driven by evolving regulations, EPR requirements, and rising customer expectations around responsible sourcing and end-of-life management. Enterprises and MSMEs alike are now looking beyond performance and cost to evaluate factors such as product longevity, energy efficiency, recycled content, and the availability of structured take-back programs.At HP, through initiatives like the HP Planet Partners program in India, we make it easy for customers to return used cartridges and hardware for responsible recycling.A: Across the industry, the shift toward e-commerce and direct-to-consumer models has significantly increased pricing transparency and reshaped customer expectations particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. The buyers today are not only comparing device prices online but are also evaluating total cost of ownership, ease of consumables access, delivery speed, and after-sales support. This has helped accelerate printer adoption in smaller cities, where digital discovery is rising but dependable local service remains critical.HP printers and cartridges are now available on Blinkit, and services like ‘Print as a Service’ on the platform are further democratizing access to printing, allowing users to get prints delivered to their doorstep within minutes. Together, these developments are driving greater convenience, expanding brand visibility, and making technology truly inclusive for all users across India.A: Hybrid work has fundamentally reshaped how Indian enterprises collaborate, and print is evolving in step with digital tools rather than being phased out. The real opportunity today is not just about improving devices, it’s about improving what users can accomplish with them. Productivity, ease of use, and a seamless experience are becoming just as important as hardware specifications.That’s why we’re shifting the conversation from individual products to the experiences our One HP portfolio can deliver. By integrating devices, software, and services into a cohesive offering, we’re anticipating customer needs and enabling a more connected, intelligent, and intuitive way of working - something that sets up apart in the market.A: At HP, we believe inclusive growth begins with access, and that’s exactly what we’re driving across India’s MSMEs, education, and home segments. While we have an overall market share of 28.9%, today, home printing penetration in India is still only about 2–3%, which highlights a massive opportunity for expansion.","Satish Kumar is the Senior Director, Print Category at HP India.

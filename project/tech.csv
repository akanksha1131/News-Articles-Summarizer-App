Poll Do You Think Business and Politics Should Be Separate? No Yes

Elon Musk has remained mum on Bannon's charges

Fight over views on H-1B visas

Steve Bannon has launched a scathing critique of Elon Musk , calling him a ""truly evil person"" in comments that deepen the growing divide between the two figures, both of whom have been influential advisers to President-elect Donald Trump In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera, Bannon declared,He added, “He won’t have a blue pass with full access to the White House. He’ll be like everyone else.” In the interview, published last week, Bannon said that halting Musk’s influence had become “a personal issue” for him.Bannon, a key architect of Trump’s 2016 presidential victory and former chief strategist in his first term, has reignited his feud with Musk, who was a major financial supporter of Trump’s re-election campaign and has since become a constant figure on Trump’s side.The attack highlights broader tensions within the right-wing movement in the U.S., where there are growing concerns about Musk’s influence and potential to reshape the direction of Trump’s political faction. Musk, the world’s wealthiest person and owner of the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), is a major player in both tech and government business through his roles at SpaceX and Tesla.Some conservative figures who initially welcomed Musk’s involvement in Republican politics now feel misled, casting doubt on the strength of their alliance with him.Trump had enlisted Musk to co-lead an initiative aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, though it remains unclear what role Bannon might play in the incoming administration. Before leaving office in 2021, Trump pardoned Bannon, who had faced charges of misusing funds raised for a group supporting Trump’s border wall.Musk has yet not so far publicly responded to Bannon’s comments.A key point of contention between the two has been the use of H-1B visas to bring skilled foreign workers into U.S. companies. While Musk supports the visas, arguing they are essential for attracting talent, many Trump supporters, including Bannon, oppose them, claiming they harm job prospects for American workers.Bannon also criticized Musk for losing the debate over the visas, questioning whether the tech mogul should have a say in U.S. politics, given his South African roots during the apartheid era. “He should go back to South Africa,” Bannon said in the interview.","Bannon, a key architect of Trump’s 2016 presidential victory and former chief strategist in his first term, has reignited his feud with Musk.

"Pawan Choudhary, CTO, Zinnia: Blockchain and ML are time-testing technologies that are seeing major surge in insurance industry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pawan-choudhary-cto-zinnia-blockchain-and-ml-are-time-testing-technologies-that-are-seeing-major-surge-in-insurance-industry/articleshow/117207736.cms,"Can you elaborate on the India team’s role in driving Zinnia’s global product innovation, particularly in the life insurance and annuities domain?

What are some global trends you see shaping the

InsurTech

ecosystem globally?

How has the growth of Blockchain and Machine Learning impacted technology solutions in the insurance industry worldwide?

How do you see technology driving changes in the insurance industry both globally and in India?

How do you compare the tech quotient of Indian insurance companies versus those in the US?

Pawan Choudhary is the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Zinnia in India. With over 20 years of experience, Pawan has previously held senior-level positions at a site head at LinkedIn, Twilio and IHS Markit. In an interaction with Times of India Tech, Pawan shared insights on technology driving insurance industry, role played by Zinnia's India team in global operations and more.Zinnia's India team plays a pivotal role in driving our global product innovation in the life & annuities domain. Our team of over 900 technologists in India are the engine behind many of our key product advancements. They also built the entire underwriting module for our term life insurance product, now used by over 50 clients globally, streamlining the application process and reducing approval times by 20%.Beyond specific product features, the India team contributes to our R&D efforts. They are currently spearheading the development of an AI-powered call center which is helping to increase rep productivity by up to 70% while reducing the operational toil. They are also exploring the application of blockchain technology to streamline annuity payouts, aiming to increase efficiency and transparency for both insurers and policyholders.India also plays a crucial role in quality assurance and testing, ensuring the reliability and security of our platform for a global user base. Their testing processes have been instrumental in achieving client confidence resulting in 2.9 billion of premium processed by our clients which is 1000% growth in premium over a period of three years.A few key global trends that are reshaping the InsurTech ecosystem are: The use of AI in almost all aspects of policy from issuance to underwriting to personalized. Another trend is the ability to buy life and annuity products without 3Ps (paper, postage & print). AI-driven personalization allows for tailoring products and services. Think personalized life insurance premiums based on individual risk or customized annuities aligned with specific retirement goals.Blockchain and machine learning (ML) are time testing technologies that are seeing a major surge in the insurance industry. Blockchain strengthens security, streamlines claims, boosts transparency and simplifies compliance. At Zinnia, we are using Blockchain to create a ledger of policy records and changes. This will help enable simplifying the conversion process across carriers. Simultaneously, machine learning powers personalized pricing and risk assessment, automate underwriting and claims, enhances customer service with AI chatbots, and enables predictive risk management.Technology is reshaping the insurance industry globally and in India, albeit at different paces. Globally, trends like AI-driven underwriting, personalized pricing, and digital-first customer experiences are becoming increasingly prevalent. Blockchain and IoT are also gaining traction, offering the potential for increased efficiency and transparency. In India, while adoption is accelerating, the focus is often on increasing insurance penetration and addressing the needs of a large, underserved population. Mobile technology and digital distribution channels are key drivers, enabling insurers to reach remote areas and offer affordable micro-insurance products. Both globally and in India, technology is streamlining operations, improving risk assessment, and enhancing customer engagement. However, challenges remain, including data privacy concerns, regulatory hurdles, and the need for digital literacy, particularly in emerging markets like India. Despite these challenges, technology's transformative power is undeniable, promising a more efficient, customer-centric, and inclusive insurance landscape.Indian insurance firms are rapidly adopting AI and digital tools to improve efficiency. Some of the scenarios of doing business in India due to IRDAI are quite welcoming for insurance companies in the country. The US companies must deal with state-based regulations which means there is no one cookie-cutter solution. There is a moat for companies which can sell and distribute insurance in all 50 US states due to heavy compliance and regulatory environment. The insurance penetration in the US is much higher and the premiums are much larger as it is getting considered as a wealth management tool rather than just insurance.","Pawan Choudhary is the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Zinnia in India.

"""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O Leary's plan to save TikTok from ban in the US has an 'India part' as well",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shark-tank-investor-kevin-o-learys-plan-to-save-tiktok-from-ban-in-the-us-has-an-india-part-as-well/articleshow/117204664.cms,"Bring TikTok back in India

. O'Leary also plans TikTok becoming ""the world's largest television network in a matter of two years"" by attracting users from countries like India, Switzerland, France, Canada, and Germany, which have also expressed concerns about TikTok's data practices.

""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary, known as ""Mr. Wonderful,"" has joined forces with Frank McCourt, founder of Project Liberty, in an attempt to acquire TikTok's US assets from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Their goal is to ""rebuild the platform in a way that prioritizes the privacy of its 170 million American users"" and address national security concerns that have led to the threat of a ban on the app in the US.This potential ban stems from the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed by President Biden after receiving bipartisan support in Congress. This law mandates the divestiture of TikTok from ByteDance by January 19, or face removal from U.S. app stores.O'Leary's involvement emphasizes addressing concerns about ""Chinese spyware"" and data security. He stated on ""The Big Money Show"" that McCourt's expertise on algorithms is crucial, allowing them to ""buy TikTok without buying the Chinese spyware."" This refers to allegations that TikTok, due to its Chinese ownership, poses a national security risk by potentially providing user data to the Chinese Communist Party. Lawmakers from both parties have voiced these concerns.O'Leary and McCourt propose a significant restructuring of TikTok's data practices. They intend to give users control over their data, allowing them to choose whether or not to share it. Crucially, O'Leary has stated that users who opt to share their data would be compensated, receiving ""a piece of the advertising action."" This monetization strategy aims to incentivize user participation while addressing privacy concerns.Beyond data ownership, O'Leary outlined further plans in appearances on Fox Business. He envisions making TikTok interoperable with other platforms like Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter), allowing cross-posting. He also expressed a desire for reciprocal data sharing with platforms like Instagram and Meta, fostering a more interconnected social media landscape. He believes these changes, coupled with restoring user trust, could expand TikTok's user base beyond its current 170 millionThe success of O'Leary and McCourt's bid reportedly hinges on two key factors. First, the Supreme Court is reviewing the law mandating TikTok's divestiture. O'Leary has indicated that a ruling upholding the law would be ""good news"" for their acquisition efforts, as it would force ByteDance to sell. Second, ByteDance's willingness to sell if legally compelled remains a critical unknown. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a fast-tracked case and a decision is expected soon.O'Leary also addressed the potential ramifications for China, emphasizing that damaging shareholder value would be counterproductive to China's desire to be seen as a stable investment destination. He pointed out that global investors, including sovereign wealth funds, hold significant investments in ByteDance, making a forced sale with reasonable terms in China's best interest.In summary, O'Leary and McCourt's bid represents a significant attempt to reshape TikTok's operations within the U.S., focusing on user privacy, data control, and interoperability. The outcome depends on both the Supreme Court's decision and ByteDance's response, with significant implications for the future of the platform in the U.S. and globally.","""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary has joined forces with Frank McCourt, founder of Project Liberty, to acquire TikTok's US assets.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently underwent a significant neck surgery, an experience he described as both painful and necessary. Known for his active presence on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk’s recent inactivity left his followers curious about his absence. On January 12, 2025, Musk responded to a fan’s query, revealing that he was recovering from a complex neck operation. This disclosure provided insight into the health challenges he has been managing for years and the factors that led to this crucial procedure.Musk traced the genesis of his neck issues to an old sumo wrestling match. During this incident, he managed to throw his opponent but severely strained his neck in the process. Over time, the strain evolved into a chronic condition, resulting in damage to the C5-C6 disc in his spine. Musk explained that this damage necessitated five surgeries over the years, with the most recent one addressing nerve inflammation and a narrowed spinal orifice. Despite these challenges, Musk has remained optimistic and candid, sharing details of his journey to recovery with his followers.Musk’s revelation sparked an outpouring of support from fans and followers on X. Numerous well-wishers sent messages of encouragement, hoping for his swift recovery, while some shared remedies and tips for managing pain and inflammation.One admirer commented, ""Wishing you a speedy recovery! The universe needs you!"" Another expressed sympathy, saying, ""Get well soon, man. That sounds rough."" A third added, ""Take care, Elon. Hope you’re feeling better soon."" Another user asked, ""Is this related to the sumo match injury? Wishing you a full recovery and thinking of you.""One follower offered advice, suggesting, “Turmeric works wonders for inflammation—try sprinkling it on your meals. Chiropractic adjustments can also relieve pressure on the nerves and ease discomfort. Additionally, consider using frankincense oil topically; it’s known for its pain-relieving properties. Hope this helps!”","Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently underwent a significant neck surgery. Musk traced the genesis of his neck issues to an old sumo wrestling match.

Sam Altman’s sister accuses him of sexual abuse; family responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-sister-accuses-him-of-sexual-abuse-family-responds/articleshow/117038723.cms,"Poll How Can Society Better Prevent Sexual Abuse? Stronger Legal Actions and Support More Education and Awareness

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statement

Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being. Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult. We know many families facing similar struggles understand this well.

Over the years, we've tried in many ways to support Annie and help her find stability, following professional advice on how to be supportive without enabling harmful behaviors. To give a sense of our efforts, we have given her monthly financial support, directly paid her bills, covered her rent, helped her find employment opportunities, attempted to get her medical help, and have offered to buy her a house through a trust (so that she would have a secure place to live, but not be able to sell it immediately). Via our late father's estate, Annie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life.

Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us. In this vein, Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. We've chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this.

Over the years, she has accused members of our family of improperly withholding our father's 401k funds, hacking her wife, and ""shadowbanning"" her from various websites including ChatGPT, Twitter, and more. The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child (she has also claimed instances of sexual abuse from others). Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.

All of these claims are utterly untrue. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.

We ask for understanding and compassion from everyone as we continue to support Annie in the best way we can. We sincerely hope she finds the stability and peace she's been searching for.

Meta ends DEI programs, shifting to merit-based hiring amid employee concerns

Customization options and LGBTQ+ concerns



Alignment with political shifts

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , Instagram, and Threads, has recently undertaken a series of sweeping changes to its policies and operations. These adjustments, which include decisions affecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, content moderation practices, and facilities management, have sparked widespread discussion. According to reports from Fox News Digital and The New York Times, these changes appear to reflect Meta’s evolving stance on workplace policies and platform governance, prompting a mix of support, criticism, and employee dissatisfaction.One of the most visible policy shifts was the removal of tampons from men’s restrooms across Meta’s offices in Silicon Valley, Texas, and New York. This decision, reported by The New York Times, impacts nonbinary and transgender employees who may require such amenities. The company has not provided detailed explanations for this change, leaving room for speculation and concern among affected staff and advocates.Meta has also revamped its approach to content moderation. In a move toward ""restoring free expression,"" the company ended its third-party fact-checking program in the United States. The program, which had been central to Meta’s efforts to combat misinformation, is being replaced by a ""community notes"" system similar to the model used by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter). This crowdsourced moderation framework is intended to allow users to collaboratively add context to potentially misleading posts.Critics argue that the elimination of fact-checking may leave the platform vulnerable to the unchecked spread of misinformation. However, Meta contends that the previous system had ""gone too far"" and impeded open discourse.Meta has discontinued its primary DEI initiatives , a decision that Joel Kaplan, Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, defended as a step toward merit-based hiring. Kaplan stated that recruitment would focus on individual qualifications rather than considerations of race or gender. While Meta frames this shift as a move to promote fairness and broaden candidate pools, internal communications reveal that LGBTQ staff members and other employees have expressed dissatisfaction, with some announcing their departure from the company.The broader implications of this policy change extend beyond recruitment. Critics worry that the absence of structured DEI programs could lead to reduced support for underrepresented groups within Meta’s workforce.Another notable change involves the removal of transgender and nonbinary customization options from the Messenger application. This move has fueled concerns about Meta's commitment to inclusivity. Internal reports indicate that LGBTQ+ employees feel alienated by these decisions, and many have raised questions about the company’s long-term priorities regarding diversity and inclusion.These policy changes come amid what many observers see as a broader alignment with the political climate in the United States, particularly with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Critics suggest that Meta’s decisions may reflect a strategic effort to gain favor with the administration by adopting positions that align with its ideological leanings. This perception is further reinforced by the company’s public emphasis on restoring ""free expression"" and its distancing from progressive DEI initiatives.Internally, the response from Meta employees has been mixed. While some staff members view the changes as necessary to streamline operations and foster innovation, others feel disillusioned by what they see as a retreat from Meta’s prior commitments to inclusivity and progressive values.Externally, Meta’s actions have drawn significant criticism from advocacy groups, public figures, and industry analysts. Some argue that these changes undermine the progress made in fostering a more equitable workplace and responsible content moderation practices.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, has made a series of changes to its policies and operations.

iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji’s ethical concerns

The death of Suchir Balaji , a former OpenAI programmer and whistleblower, has once again brought the ethics and transparency of artificial intelligence development into sharp focus. Balaji, who was found dead in his San Francisco residence last year, was a vocal critic of OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model. His concerns, which ranged from the ethical implications of generative AI to potential copyright violations, have sparked a broader debate within the technology sector and beyond. His family and prominent figures like Elon Musk have raised questions about the circumstances surrounding his death, challenging the police’s conclusion of suicide and demanding further investigation.Suchir Balaji joined OpenAI with the belief that artificial intelligence would serve humanity’s greater good. However, his mother, Poornima Rao, has revealed that her son became increasingly disillusioned when OpenAI transitioned to a for-profit organization. Speaking with entrepreneur Mario Nawfal, she explained that this shift deeply troubled Balaji, who viewed the commercialization of AI as a potential threat to ethical innovation. ""The reason he joined OpenAI was his belief that AI will help humanity,"" Rao stated. ""When OpenAI became for-profit, his concerns began to grow.""Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who later distanced himself from the organization, has echoed similar concerns. As per reports, Musk has been vocal about his skepticism of profit-driven AI development, asserting that such a focus could undermine the promise of AI as a tool for humanity’s benefit.Elon Musk reshared Rao’s interview on X (formerly Twitter), bringing renewed attention to the controversy surrounding Balaji’s death, as reported. Musk’s comments have fueled discussions about transparency and accountability in the tech industry. Describing the official suicide ruling as questionable, Musk stated, “It did not seem like a suicide,” adding weight to calls for a deeper investigation.In response, Rao expressed gratitude for Musk’s support and for providing a platform to share her concerns. “Thank you for your attention to this,” she commented. “Thank you for the X platform where we can express facts openly without fear of being killed.” This statement underscored the role of social media in amplifying voices that often go unheard in traditional media outlets.During his tenure at OpenAI, Balaji raised alarms about the ethical ramifications of generative AI. Weeks before his death, he participated in a New York Times article discussing the use of copyrighted material in AI training datasets. Balaji argued that many generative AI products could violate copyright laws by creating outputs that compete directly with original content. On social media, he emphasised the importance of understanding the legal and ethical implications of AI, stating, “Fair use seems like an implausible defense for many generative AI products.”Balaji’s critiques align with broader industry concerns. Legislators and business leaders have raised alarms about the potential for AI to erode copyright protections and disrupt creative industries. His warnings remain central to ongoing debates about the ethical boundaries of AI innovation.Balaji’s family and supporters have called for a comprehensive investigation into his death, citing unanswered questions about the circumstances. His mother believes his doubts about OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model contributed to his distress. The family’s demands for clarity highlight the growing tension between ethical principles and profit motives in the tech sector.Elon Musk has positioned himself as one of OpenAI’s most vocal critics, arguing that financial interests could compromise the original mission of advancing AI responsibly. His remarks have amplified scrutiny of the organization’s practices and reignited debates about the role of accountability in AI development.","Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI programmer and whistleblower, was found dead in his San Francisco residence last year.

Powell Jobs' journey to this iconic site underscores the growing global interest in Indian spiritual practices. Her visit included prayers for the successful completion of the Maha Kumbh, one of India's most significant religious gatherings.Speaking to reporters, Swami Kailashanand Giri addressed the significance of Powell Jobs’ visit, describing her as a ""daughter"" who holds Indian spiritual practices in high regard. He noted her genuine interest in understanding and embracing these traditions. ""She is very religious and spiritual,"" Swami Kailashanand said, adding that Powell Jobs respects him as a father and Guru. Highlighting the increasing acceptance of Indian culture worldwide, he remarked, ""Indian traditions are being embraced across the globe.""During her visit, Powell Jobs adhered strictly to temple protocols. As per reports, Swami Kailashanand clarified that non-Hindus are not permitted to touch the sacred Shivling, and Powell Jobs honored this rule by viewing it from outside the sanctum. Her compliance with these customs underscores her respect for the sanctity of Indian religious practices.The visit also brought attention to the Akhara's efforts to expand its spiritual reach globally. Swami Kailashanand Giri announced plans to appoint Maharshi Vyasanand, the first Mahamandaleshwar from the United States. Maharshi Vyasanand expressed his gratitude, stating, ""I am honored to represent the Shankaracharya Parampara to the world."" This development further highlights the growing influence of Indian spirituality on a global scale.Powell Jobs' visit included rituals and offerings, reflecting the universal appeal of the temple's spiritual essence. Swami Kailashanand emphasized that the prayers offered during the visit were dedicated to the successful completion of the Maha Kumbh.The Maha Kumbh, one of the world's largest religious congregations, occurs every 12 years in Prayagraj and is expected to attract over 450 million devotees in 2025. Key bathing dates, including Makar Sankranti on January 14, Mauni Amavasya on January 29, and Basant Panchami on February 3, will witness millions gathering to take holy dips in the sacred Ganges River.The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, one of India’s 12 Jyotirlingas, has seen an exponential rise in visitors since the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham in December 2021. Powell Jobs' presence at this spiritual landmark signifies the global resonance of this sacred site, which has become a focal point for people seeking spiritual enlightenment.","Laurene Powell Jobs paid a visit to the revered Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi on Saturday.

""Elon has been very clear that he's doing this for the public interest and not for his personal gain. And I take him at face value,"" Bezos said.The comments come as Blue Origin prepares for the debut launch of its New Glenn rocket, a significant milestone in its efforts to compete with Musk's SpaceX .

Last month, Musk suggested that the US should prioritise missions to Mars over returning to the moon, raising concerns about potential changes to NASA 's space exploration program.Bezos, however, remains optimistic about the future of space exploration under the new administration. He believes that both lunar and Martian missions are essential and should continue without interruption.

This practice has always been subject to public debate and is currently being challenged. We believe there are other ways to build an industry-leading workforce and leverage teams made up of world-class people from all types of backgrounds to build products that work for everyone.



We previously ended representation goals for women and ethnic minorities. Having goals can create the impression that decisions are being made based on race or gender. While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.



We are sunsetting our supplier diversity efforts within our broader supplier strategy. This effort focused on sourcing from diverse-owned businesses; going forward, we will focus our efforts on supporting small and medium sized businesses that power much of our economy. Opportunities will continue to be available to all qualified suppliers, including those who were part of the supplier diversity program.



Instead of equity and inclusion training programs, we will build programs that focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.



We will no longer have a team focused on DEI. Maxine Williams is taking on a new role at Meta, focused on accessibility and engagement.



We serve everyone. We are committed to making our products accessible, beneficial and universally impactful for everyone.

We build the best teams with the most talented people. This means sourcing people from a range of candidate pools, but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender etc.). We will always evaluate people as individuals.

We drive consistency in employment practices to ensure fairness and objectivity for all. We do not provide preferential treatment, extra opportunities or unjustified credit to anyone based on protected characteristics nor will we devalue impact based on these characteristics.

We build connection and community. We support our employee communities, people who use our products, and those in the communities where we operate. Our employee community groups (MRGs) continue to be open to all.

The changes include ending the company's Diverse Slate Approach in hiring and sunsetting supplier diversity programs.Janelle Gale , Meta's vice president of human resources, announced in the memo that the company would shift toward ""fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all."" The move comes amid what she described as a changing legal and policy landscape surrounding DEI efforts in the United States.Business Insider obtained the memo, which revealed that Maxine Williams, who previously led DEI efforts, will transition to a new role focused on accessibility and engagement.The social media giant had already discontinued its representation goals for women and ethnic minorities, citing concerns that such targets could create impressions of race or gender-based decision-making. The company will now focus its supplier strategy on supporting small and medium-sized businesses rather than diverse-owned enterprises.In defending the changes, Gale emphasized Meta's commitment to serving everyone through "" cognitively diverse teams "" while maintaining that no one should receive preferential treatment based on protected characteristics.The company will continue to support employee community groups, known as MRGs, which will remain open to all staff members.Read the full memo:Hi all,I wanted to share some changes we're making to our hiring, development and procurement practices. Before getting into the details, there is some important background to lay out:The legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing. The Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. It reaffirms longstanding principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics. The term ""DEI"" has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.At Meta, we have a principle of serving everyone. This can be achieved through cognitively diverse teams, with differences in knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Such teams are better at innovating, solving complex problems and identifying new opportunities which ultimately helps us deliver on our ambition to build products that serve everyone. On top of that, we've always believed that no-one should be given - or deprived of -opportunities because of protected characteristics, and that has not changed.Given the shifting legal and policy landscape, we're making the following changes:What remains the same are the principles we've used to guide our People practices:Meta has the privilege to serve billions of people every day.

The conversation surrounding long working hours reignited recently following remarks by Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan, suggesting employees should work up to 90 hours a week, even on Sundays. This controversial statement sparked widespread debate, drawing responses from other prominent corporate leaders. Former HCL CEO Vineet Nayar , Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra , and industrialist Gautam Adani weighed in with diverse perspectives that challenge the glorification of excessive working hours. Their viewpoints underline the importance of work-life balance , personal fulfillment, and productivity.Former HCL CEO Vineet Nayar took a contrasting stance, emphasizing the importance of living a fulfilling life rather than measuring productivity in hours worked. In a LinkedIn post, Nayar questioned the glorification of relentless work schedules and criticized the culture of constant connectivity.He shared a personal anecdote with a picture of a street-side professional giving him a head massage, saying, “Today, I didn’t just get a head massage. I took back a moment of my life.” Nayar argued that moments of relaxation and reflection are essential to maintaining energy, creativity, and purpose.He proposed a balanced approach: “Work more if you want. Work less if you can. The number doesn’t matter. What matters is whether you’re making space for moments that make life worth living.”L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan ignited controversy by advocating for 90-hour workweeks and even suggested employees should work on Sundays. He remarked on the supposed futility of excessive time spent at home, famously asking, “How long can you stare at your wife?” While his comments were intended to highlight the importance of dedication to nation-building, they sparked backlash across social media, with many criticising the unrealistic and unhealthy expectations such a schedule entails.Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra echoed similar sentiments, advocating for prioritising the quality of work over the quantity of hours spent. He emphasised that impactful decisions and meaningful contributions are not dependent on excessive hours but rather on well-rounded decision-making informed by a balanced life.Mahindra stated, “It’s not about 40 hours, 70 hours, or 90 hours. What matters is the output and impact. Even 10 hours can change the world if they’re productive.” He also stressed the importance of spending time with family, friends, and personal reflection, asserting that such experiences enrich professional decision-making.Industrialist Gautam Adani took a more individualistic approach, asserting that work-life balance should be a personal choice. He noted that different individuals derive fulfillment from varying levels of engagement with family or work. “If someone spends four hours with their family and feels content, or another spends eight hours and enjoys it, that’s their balance,” Adani explained.However, his humorous remark—“Aath ghanta family ke saath bitayega tho biwi bhaag jaayegi (If you spend eight hours with your family, your wife might leave)”—drew criticism online. Many accused him of trivializing the importance of family time and promoting toxic work cultures.The responses from Nayar, Mahindra, and Adani collectively reflect a shift in workplace values. Leaders are increasingly advocating for a nuanced, personalized approach to balancing professional and personal life. Their perspectives underline the importance of focusing on fulfillment, mental well-being , and quality productivity over sheer effort.While Subrahmanyan’s remarks sparked controversy, they also reignited critical discussions about workplace cultures, encouraging leaders and employees alike to reevaluate their priorities. As the global workforce navigates challenges in productivity, health, and satisfaction, the debate underscores the need to balance professional ambition with personal fulfillment.","The conversation surrounding long working hours reignited recently following remarks by Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan, suggesting employees should work up to 90 hours a week.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, has long partnered with professional fact-checking organizations to combat misinformation on its platforms. However, a recent decision to replace third-party fact-checkers with a crowdsourced moderation model in the United States has drawn criticism from experts and stakeholders. As per reports, the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), a prominent group under the Poynter Institute, has led the charge against this move, emphasising its potential impact on the quality and reliability of information shared online. With 71 organizations already signing an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg , the debate underscores the global stakes of Meta’s policy changes.Meta announced its decision to phase out third-party fact-checking partnerships in the U.S. and transition to a crowdsourced moderation system. This model, similar to the ""community notes"" employed by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter), allows users to provide input on the validity of posts. Meta framed the move as part of a broader initiative to promote transparency and community involvement in content moderation.Despite its ambitious scope, the policy shift has been met with skepticism. Critics argue that while crowdsourced systems may democratize moderation, they lack the rigor and expertise of professional fact-checkers.The IFCN penned an open letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, expressing deep concern over the abandonment of third-party fact-checking in favor of crowdsourced models, as reported by Business Insider. Signed by 71 organizations globally, the letter highlighted the critical role professional fact-checkers play in combating misinformation and fostering evidence-based discussions.“Fact-checking is essential to maintaining shared realities and evidence-based discussion, both in the United States and globally,” the letter emphasised.The IFCN warned that Meta's decision is a step backward, jeopardizing accurate and trustworthy information on platforms used by billions daily.Meta’s fact-checking partnerships span over 100 countries, providing crucial support for combating misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. According to reports, the IFCN raised concerns about the potential global implications if Meta extends this policy worldwide.“If Meta decides to stop the program globally, it is almost certain to result in real-world harm in many places,” the IFCN wrote. The organization highlighted the financial and operational vulnerabilities of smaller fact-checking groups that rely on Meta's funding to sustain their work.The proposed crowdsourced system has drawn comparisons to the community notes feature on X, which allows users to add context to posts. While this model has its merits, it has also faced criticism for being slow to address misinformation and lacking the expertise required to debunk complex claims.The IFCN proposed a hybrid approach, combining the strengths of professional fact-checking with community input. “The need for this is great: If people believe social media platforms are full of scams and hoaxes, they won’t want to spend time there or do business on them,” the letter stated.Meta’s platforms serve more than 3.3 billion users daily, accounting for over 40% of the global population. Despite the controversy surrounding the policy change, advertising insiders believe it is unlikely to affect Meta’s revenue significantly. With over a fifth of the U.S. digital ad market, Meta’s dominance remains largely unchallenged, according to EMARKETER data."," Meta announced its decision to phase out third-party fact-checking partnerships in the U.S. and transition to a crowdsourced moderation system.

Speaking on Joe Rogan's podcast, the Meta CEO accused Apple of blocking competition, citing AirPods' closed connectivity and rejecting Meta's attempts to integrate Ray-Ban smart glasses with iPhones under the guise of security concerns.

"Edelweiss MF CEO Radhika Gupta joins 90-hour work week with a long post on 'Choices, Hard Work and Happiness'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/edelweiss-mf-ceo-radhika-gupta-joins-90-hour-work-week-with-a-long-post-on-choices-hard-work-and-happiness/articleshow/117164948.cms,"Radhika Gupta joins the 90-hour work debate.

Take a look at her post



“Choices, Hard Work and Happiness

I debated whether to write this post, because the risk of being misquoted on this issue in this clickbait world is high. But I am trying to share what is a nuanced point of view on the issue of work-life balance.

1. Hard work is important and I was taught and believe that it is the only way to rise. In the competitive workplace, I also believe the person who works harder will rise faster. Great careers, achievements, and companies are the results of a lot of hard work.

2. Hard work is a choice. Ambition is a choice. And choices have consequences. Not everybody has to aspire to be a CEO or founder with a mega exit. I know many people who have chosen the path of a less demanding career within their field because time off from work matters to them. No judgments.

3. Now let's talk hours. I worked 100 hours a week for four consecutive months on my 1st project during my 1st job.18 hours a day, with one day off (and not Sunday—I got Monday off because I had to be at a client site on Sunday).

What was it like? 90% of the time, I was miserable. I went to office bathrooms and cried, ate chocolate cake from room service at 2 a.m., and was hospitalized twice. Most importantly, I may have been at work for 100 hours, but I was not productive in those. The same story is true for many of my graduating classmates who joined similar roles in banking, consulting, etc.

Hard work is not equal to hours worked. Many of those hours in entry-level careers were pure facetime. Heck, I know a friend who created a screensaver with an Excel model to convince their boss they were in the office! No wonder many of us didn't last in those roles very long. Hard work needs to be sustainable for us to be able to do it for a long period of time, which is when compounding kicks in.

4. Hours is not equal to

productivity

. Many developed nations work 8–4 but ensure those hours are productive. Come in on time, bring your best to work, have only necessary meetings, and use technology to be effective. Recently, I was telling my investment team, “Let’s find a way to use AI to make research more efficient—our talent cannot spend hours on grunt work.”

5. Family and mental health cannot be absent from this. Otherwise, we will build a world of anxiety and breakdowns, early heart attacks, unhappy marriages, and absentee parenting. I could work those hours I did as a young, single girl because I had no responsibilities. Today, between my career, managing my home, caring for parents, and giving time to my husband and son, I am consumed. And this is despite privilege: a hands-on husband, support staff, parents who chip in, and lots of resources. I commute 1.5 hours a day, but many commute 3–4 hours in our cities. They have homes to run, chores to do, dabbas to pack, kids to drop to school and more.

6. As organizations, we have to think about the culture we create. Of course, founders/CEOs work harder—they have economic incentives to do so. But I have found in our own org that when you create a culture where people find purpose in what they do, they will go above and beyond for you, even in difficult personal circumstances. Forcing anything is hard, let alone enforcing a certain number of hours. Inspiring people to give their best is easier.

7. All of us have to contribute to making India a developed nation. But as we do so, we should also strive to be a happy nation—enjoying the fruits of that development: the joy of building, of giving our families better lives, and of experiencing what the previous generation may not have had. Happiness, inclusive growth, and development go hand in hand.

Finally, I meet many young people, especially women, who are questioning whether they should have a family because of the fear that family and career cannot coexist. This debate scares them even more. Having a happy relationship with work and life is possible while contributing to the dream of Viksit Bharat. Let’s tell our kids that.”

Radhika Gupta , Managing Director and CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund , has weighed in on the ongoing debate around work-life balance . Taking to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Gupta shared her perspective following the controversy sparked by L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan’s remarks suggesting employees work 90-hour weeks. Subrahmanyan’s comments, including a reference to ""staring at your wife,"" drew widespread criticism, with figures like Deepika Padukone and billionaire Anand Mahindra offering contrasting views. In her post, Gupta acknowledged the nuanced nature of the discussion, stressing that while hard work is essential for success, the balance between work and personal life is a deeply individual choice influenced by personal goals and ambitions.In her elaborate X post, Gupta wrote:",Radhika Gupta has weighed in on the ongoing debate on the issue of work-life balance in India.

Other tech leaders that may attend Trump’s inauguration

Several prominent tech leaders have already met President-elect Donald Trump and now a number of them are set to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration this month, a report has said. This may signal the industry's efforts to strengthen ties with Trump as he returns to the White House.According to a report by Bloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg , the CEO of Facebook-parent company Meta , intends to be present, as confirmed by a source familiar with the matter. Zuckerberg has reportedly met with Trump two times ahead of him assuming office as the President of the US. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also plans to attend the swearing-in ceremony on January 20, according to a company spokesperson. Previous reports have said that Altman is finding it difficult to meet the President-elect because of Elon Musk , who is purportedly stationed as a gatekeeper. Anyone who wants to meet Trump has to go through Musk, reports claimed. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will participate in some of the surrounding festivities, according to the company. Uber also plans to co-host an inauguration party in Washington with Elon Musk’s X social media firm and The Free Press, a media company, Bloomberg said.In addition to Altman, OpenAI president Greg Brockman and chief product officer Kevin Weil also plan to attend the inauguration, as told by a company spokesperson to the publication. Musk is also likely to attend, given his close relationship with Trump.Various tech leaders, such as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have reportedly met with Trump after his win in the US Presidential elections.Meta and Amazon have pledged to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, meanwhile, Altman has personally donated $1 million to the fund.","Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook-parent company Meta, intends to be present, as confirmed by a source familiar with the matter.

Elon Musk gives an update on Neuralink’s third human brain implant: ‘We upgraded…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-gives-an-update-on-neuralinks-third-human-brain-implant-we-upgraded/articleshow/117155968.cms,"Take a look at the video here



What Musk said about Neuralink's third human implant



“We’ve got now three humans with Neuralinks implanted and they’re working well. We upgraded the devices, they’ll have more electrodes, basically higher bandwidth, longer battery life and everything. So, expect 20 or 30 patients this year with the upgraded Neuralink devices.""

What Musk said about Neuralink’s roadmap



“With our first product, we’re trying to enable people who have lost their brain-body connection. So, if they are tetraplegic, paraplegic or, as you can imagine say Stephen Hawking. If

could communicate as fast or even faster than a normal human, that would be transformational. Being able to read the motor cortex of the brain. If you think about moving your hand, it will move the cursor on the screen. And it enables people to control their computer or their phone just by thinking. Then our next part will be

Blindsight devices

where even if somebody has lost both eyes or has lost the optic nerve, we can interface directly with the visual cortex in the brain and enable them to see. We already have that working in monkeys,”

“We think if you have a second Neuralink device, that is past the point where the spinal damage occurred. We can transmit the signals from the brain past where essentially the wires are broken and enable someone to walk again. I'm confident that that is physically possible. In the long term goal for Neuralink is to be able to improve the bandwidth. So, right now, when we're speaking our bandwidth and this per second is quite low and the sustained bandwidth of a human is less than one bit per second over 24 hours,”","Musk: ""We’ve got now three humans with Neuralinks implanted and they’re working well"" ""We think if you have a second Neuralink device, that is past the point where the spinal damage occurred,"" he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117156121,imgsize-707642,width-400,resizemode-4/117156121.jpg"

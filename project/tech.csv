Facebook parent Meta becomes the latest American company to 'go nuclear' for AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-becomes-the-latest-american-company-to-go-nuclear-for-ai/articleshow/121606959.cms,"Meta has signed a 20-year agreement to secure nuclear power to meet the growing energy demands for artificial intelligence and other computing needs at Facebook’s parent company. According to a report by Associated Press, the deal will also boost the output of Constellation Energy’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.Announced on June 3, the agreement is part of a broader trend of tech companies partnering with nuclear energy providers as AI usage surges. Financial terms were not disclosed. The Clinton plant, originally set to close in 2017 due to financial losses, was sustained by Illinois’ zero-emission credit program, which expires in 2027, as per the report. The Meta deal, effective from June 2027, will increase the plant’s clean energy output by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs, and generate $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, the companies said.“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Meta’s head of global energy, Urvi Parekh, said. The report notes that tech giants face dual pressures: increasing energy supplies for AI and data centers while meeting ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals. Constellation, which owns the shuttered Three Mile Island plant, announced in September a plan to restart it to supply Microsoft’s data centers, the AP reports. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the U.S.’ worst commercial nuclear accident in 1979.Amazon and Google have also invested in small nuclear reactors, with Amazon announcing plans two days after Google last fall, and Google investing in three advanced nuclear projects with Elementl Power last month, according to the report.The AP report adds that 25 states passed legislation supporting advanced nuclear energy last year, with over 200 nuclear-friendly bills introduced this year, per the Nuclear Energy Institute. However, the U.S. faces challenges in scaling nuclear production, with no next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors built in nearly 50 years, completed significantly over budget and behind schedule in Georgia, the AP states.Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are also investing in solar and wind energy, which produce no greenhouse gas emissions, the AP adds.", Meta has signed a 20-year agreement to secure nuclear power to meet the growing energy demands for artificial intelligence.

An open-source software , originally designed for hobbyist drones, powered a recent Ukrainian attack that allegedly destroyed a third of Russia’s strategic long-range bombers, a report has said. The original creators of ArduPilot expressed surprise at the software’s wartime application.According to a report by 404Media, Chris Anderson, one of ArduPilot's founders, commented on LinkedIn below attack footage, ""That's ArduPilot, launched from my basement 18 years ago. Crazy.""On X, Anderson tagged co-creators Jordi Muñoz and Jason Short in a post about the attack. Short replied, ""Not in a million years would I have predicted this outcome. I just wanted to make flying robots.""""Ardupilot powered drones just took out half the Russian strategic bomber fleet,"" he added.ArduPilot, an open-source software system, originated in 2007. Anderson launched DIYdrones.com and assembled an early UAV autopilot using Lego Mindstorms. Two years later, Muñoz won an autonomous vehicle competition using a small helicopter with autopilot. Muñoz and Anderson subsequently founded 3DR, an early consumer drone company, and released initial versions of ArduPilot in 2009.Over the next decade, ArduPilot was refined by its creators and a global community of hobbyist and professional drone pilots. As open-source software, it is free to use and can be modified for various purposes. In this instance, it facilitated a complex series of small drone strikes.The software enables connection to a DIY drone, displays a GPS-linked map, and can control takeoff, flight, and landing. Pilots can set waypoints for autonomous flight.Even without GPS, which Russia jams using its GLONASS system, ArduPilot provides assistive features. These include drone stabilisation, a ""loitering mode"" for temporary halts, and failsafe modes to maintain flight if signal is lost.The ArduPilot project website describes the software as ""a trusted, versatile, and open source autopilot system supporting many vehicle types.""It lists peaceful use cases such as ""search and rescue, submersible ROV, 3D mapping, first person view [flying], and autonomous mowers and tractors."" The website does not mention its repurposing for military use.

Who was Sana Yousaf?

Who was Sana Yousaf, a TikToker, shot dead in Islamabad

Sana Yousaf shot dead at home: Police probe honour killing angle

Social media backlash and support

Sana Yousaf was more than just a TikTok sensation. At just 17 years old, the young Pakistani influencer had become a vibrant force for change, using her platform to advocate for women's education, preserve the cultural heritage of Chitral, and promote progressive thinking within traditionally conservative regions. With nearly half a million followers across TikTok and Instagram, Sana’s short-form videos showcasing traditional dresses, folk songs, and messages of empowerment had touched a nerve among Pakistan’s youth.Tragically, her life was cut short when she was fatally shot inside her home in Islamabad’s Sector G-13. Authorities suspect an honour killing, a deeply entrenched cultural practice that continues to plague parts of Pakistan, particularly when women choose paths deemed ‘inappropriate’ or ‘dishonourable’ by their families or communities. As of now, no arrests have been made, but the incident has sparked renewed debate over women’s safety, the power of digital voices, and the deadly consequences of honour-based violence.Sana Yousaf hailed from Upper Chitral in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a region known for its mountains, distinct cultural identity, and conservative social norms. She was the daughter of a local social activist and had carved out a space for herself online as a voice for underrepresented rural women. Her content often blended traditional Chitrali culture with contemporary messages, combining folk music, dance, and local dress with outspoken support for girls’ education and women’s agency.Despite her young age, Sana Yousaf understood the power of social media to reach beyond geographic and linguistic boundaries. Her videos were not just about aesthetics—they were messages of resilience, pushing back against regressive mindsets and calling for a more inclusive Pakistan.According to multiple media reports, Sana was shot at point-blank range by a male relative who visited her home on June 1, 2025. The suspect reportedly engaged her in brief conversation before entering the home, where he fired multiple rounds. She died on the spot, and the assailant fled the scene. Her body was transported to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) for autopsy.Police are actively investigating the murder, with honour killing being one of the leading lines of inquiry. Although no arrests have been made, a manhunt is underway, and authorities are considering familial motives and potential social backlash from her online presence as possible triggers.Following the news of her murder, social media erupted in outrage and grief. The hashtags #JusticeForSanaYousaf and #StopHonourKillings trended on Pakistani Twitter (X), with activists, journalists, and ordinary users demanding accountability.Many pointed out the double standards in Pakistani society, where men are often allowed freedom to speak, act, and live as they wish, while women are subjected to violence for expressing their identity. Others emphasized the chilling effect this murder may have on other young girls who look up to influencers like Sana as role models.A leading women’s rights organization, Aurat March Pakistan, released a statement condemning the killing and calling for immediate legal action. “The murder of Sana Yousaf is not just a personal tragedy—it is a reflection of a systemic failure to protect women who dare to live with autonomy and pride,” the statement read.","Sana Yousaf, a 17-year-old Pakistani influencer, was shot dead in her home in Islamabad.

Morgan Stanley bull has this prediction for Elon Musk's EV company Tesla,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/morgan-stanley-bull-has-this-prediction-for-elon-musks-ev-company-tesla/articleshow/121603102.cms,"Tesla may not be interested in eVTOL anytime soon

Why eVTOL market may not a profitable bet yet

Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Elon Musk may be ""tempted to solve"" another ""problem"" by leveraging Tesla's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), batteries and manufacturing. As per Jones, the problem is ""commercialising air taxis,"" also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.In his latest research note, Jonas argued that Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market as these aircraft have long been predicted to revolutionise urban transport, yet even leading developers like Archer Aviation are still in the developmental phase.Last week, Archer's Midnight prototype, slated for its first deliveries later this year to Abu Dhabi, successfully completed a piloted flight test.According to a report by Fortune, while Jonas believes that solving this technological challenge aligns with the interests of Tesla engineers, he acknowledged that Tesla has indicated it is currently too stretched to seriously consider an eVTOL venture, without outright refuting the idea.The US government is reportedly keen on supporting the growth of flying cars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted this week, ""eVOTLs [sic] are going to fundamentally transform how the public travels. Let’s make sure the US leads the way.""Currently, the eVTOL market faces significant hurdles. Several promising startups, including Lilium and Volocopter, have encountered financial difficulties before establishing commercially viable services. A key challenge in achieving stringent safety standards while ensuring full autonomy, as scaling the business typically requires removing costly pilots from the equation. Additionally, there aren't enough customers with pilot licenses to support widespread adoption.","Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market, says Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas.

5 biggest AI announcements at Microsoft Build 2025

Microsoft, Google, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks have announced that they will create a public glossary for state-sponsored hacking groups and cybercriminals. The goal is to reduce confusion caused by numerous unofficial nicknames for these entities. Microsoft and CrowdStrike expressed hopes of involving other industry partners and the US government in this effort to identify threat actors.""We do believe this will accelerate our collective response and collective defense against these threat actors,"" stated Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president at Microsoft Security.Cybersecurity companies have long assigned coded names to hacking groups because attributing digital attacks can be difficult. Researchers need a way to track their adversaries.These names vary from functional, like ""APT1"" (Mandiant) or ""TA453"" (Proofpoint), to more colorful aliases such as ""Earth Lamia"" (TrendMicro) or ""Equation Group"" (Kaspersky). CrowdStrike's evocative names, like "" Cozy Bear "" for Russian hackers and ""Kryptonite Panda"" for Chinese groups, have been particularly popular, leading others to adopt similar styles. For example, Secureworks (now owned by Sophos) began using ""Iron Twilight"" for Russian hackers previously known as ""TG-4127"" in 2016.Microsoft also recently changed its naming convention from element-themed names like ""Rubidium"" to weather-themed ones such as ""Lemon Sandstorm"" or ""Sangria Tempest.""""But the same actor that Microsoft refers to as Midnight Blizzard might be referred to as Cozy Bear, APT29, or UNC2452 by another vendor. Our mutual customers are always looking for clarity. Aligning the known commonalities among these actor names directly with peers helps to provide greater clarity and gives defenders a clearer path to action,"" Jakkal said.However, the proliferation of these unique aliases has created overload.

Why Elon Musk and Tesla are fighting over his pay

Tesla Board may have a plan to resolve the dispute

Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Quick review and AI features

A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report recently said that Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla . The tech billionaire has responded to the report in affirmative. Quoting an X post, Musk wrote “Zero for seven years, despite increasing the value of the company >2000%”.WSJ report titled “How Much Should the World’s Richest Man Get Paid?” said that “Elon Musk was the lowest-paid chief executive of an S&P 500 company last year. Tesla paid him $0.”“It has been that way for several years amid a legal battle over a monster stock award in 2018,” it added.Elon Musk and Tesla have been at loggerheads for several years over his pay package. It all started with a 2018 stock award. His compensation package then included 304 million stock options. It was a performance-based deal, meaning Musk would receive stock options based on Tesla's stock price and performance meeting specific targets.The CEO became eligible to exercise all the options in 2023 after meeting a series of aggressive valuation and financial performance goals set by the company.However, in January 2024, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick cancelled the deal, saying the amount was too large and that Tesla's board members were too influenced by Musk. She said they acted “like supine servants of an overweening master.”In early 2024 during the court ruling, these options were worth about $56 billion, later peaking at $146 billion in December and currently standing at around $98 billion based on Tesla’s share price.Earlier this year, a report by Financial Times said that Tesla’s board has formed a special committee to review Musk’s compensation. The existence of the special committee was disclosed in a SEC filing for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025. It said:“Additionally, the Company’s Board of Directors has established a Special Committee to consider certain compensation matters involving Mr. Musk.”The report quoted sources familiar with the matter, who said that the committee comprises board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson.","Elon Musk and Tesla have been at loggerheads for several years over his pay package.

Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand as FTC trial continues

What comes next for Meta

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market. Meta argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121252048,imgsize-33102,width-400,resizemode-4/Mark-Zuckerbergs-Meta-seeks-mid-trial-dismissal-of-FTC-antitrust-battle.jpg"

"Jeff Bezos’ $165 billion divorce lesson: New bride Lauren gets prenup, not Amazon shares",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jeff-bezos-165-billion-divorce-lesson-new-bride-lauren-gets-prenup-not-amazon-shares/articleshow/121513202.cms,"Jeff Bezos’ $165 billion divorce lesson: New bride Lauren gets prenup, not Amazon shares

Bezos’ divorce bombshell: How a missing prenup created a $35 billion settlement

Bezos’ new romance, new rules: The $220 billion prenup strategy

Inside the billion-dollar prenup: Legal experts weigh in

When Jeff Bezos married MacKenzie Scott in 1993, few could have predicted the trajectory of their lives. At the time, Amazon was a fledgling online bookstore operating from a garage, and the tech boom that would make Bezos one of the richest people in history was still years away. Their 25-year marriage not only survived Amazon's meteoric rise but also played a crucial role in shaping one of the most iconic business empires of the 21st century. Yet, despite the immense wealth they amassed, the couple entered their union without a prenuptial agreement—a decision that would reverberate globally after their 2019 divorce.MacKenzie walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon, instantly catapulting her into the ranks of the world's richest women. As of 2025, Forbes estimates her net worth to be around $165.3 billion. That highly publicized split not only altered the tech landscape but also sparked renewed conversations about asset protection in high-net-worth marriages.Now, with Jeff Bezos preparing to marry his fiancée Lauren Sánchez, a former TV anchor and entrepreneur, he appears to be approaching marriage with a new playbook. Legal insiders and wealth advisors reveal that this time, Bezos has opted for a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional prenuptial agreement — a far cry from the informal beginning of his first marriage.Jeff and MacKenzie Scott met in the early 1990s when they were both working at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. The couple moved to Seattle, where Bezos launched Amazon in 1994 with MacKenzie as one of the earliest employees. Their professional and personal lives were deeply intertwined, and as the company flourished, so did their financial fortune. MacKenzie played a key role in Amazon’s early operations, even helping with the company’s initial business plan. Their shared vision laid the foundation for what would become one of the most valuable companies in the world.However, when they announced their divorce in 2019, one crucial detail became the focus: the absence of a prenuptial agreement. As a result, under Washington state’s community property laws, MacKenzie was entitled to half of all marital assets — including a significant portion of Bezos’ Amazon shares.Ultimately, she walked away with 25% of their shared Amazon holdings, equivalent to about 4% of the company’s total shares at the time. That stake alone was valued at approximately $35 billion when the settlement was finalized, though her net worth has since grown due to stock value increases and philanthropic activities. MacKenzie Scott has since become one of the most influential philanthropists in the world, donating billions to causes focused on equity, education, and public health. Her giving strategy, known for its speed and trust-based approach, has redefined modern philanthropy.Bezos' new relationship with Lauren Sánchez, which began publicly in 2019 shortly after his divorce, has been markedly different. Sánchez, a media personality, helicopter pilot, and founder of Black Ops Aviation, has her own career and public profile. However, the wealth disparity between the two is massive. Bezos, with a net worth of around $220 billion, remains one of the top three richest individuals globally.This stark financial imbalance has prompted Bezos to take a vastly different approach in his second marriage — one focused on legal precision, asset protection, and long-term planning.According to Certified Family Law Specialist Alphonse Provinziano, Bezos' prenuptial agreement with Sánchez is likely airtight. Speaking to HELLO!, Provinziano noted that such agreements in ultra-high-net-worth marriages typically involve extensive documentation of separate property and future earnings exclusions. These agreements are meticulously crafted with the input of top legal and financial experts. They aim to preemptively resolve disputes that could arise from complex asset portfolios. They often include legal language vetted across multiple jurisdictions. Such precautions are especially crucial when international assets or income streams are involved.“There would be a clear enumeration of all business assets and ownership interests, stating these would be considered Jeff Bezos' separate property,” he explained. This ensures that the division of assets post-divorce remains uncontested. It also minimizes the chances of lengthy litigation or financial surprises.In other words, Sánchez would not be entitled to any share of Amazon, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, or any related entities regardless of how long the marriage lasts — unless otherwise stipulated.These prenups often include clauses preventing spouses from claiming business appreciation, intellectual property growth, or share in future ventures unless there’s joint investment or involvement. They may even have confidentiality clauses and non-disparagement agreements to avoid post-divorce public disputes. Such terms are common in celebrity or high-profile marriages to maintain reputational integrity. They reflect a broader trend of legal foresight among billionaires seeking long-term asset protection. These agreements essentially serve as legal firewalls in case of relationship breakdown. They are part of a growing norm among the ultra-rich to future-proof personal and business legacies.","Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott divorced in 2019 after 25 years of marriage.

Laura Loomer has slammed the Republican Party for driving away Elon Musk , whom she termed as “their biggest donor”. In a post on social media X, Loomer criticized Republican Party, popularly known as Grand Old Party ( GOP ) for failing to codify spending cuts proposed under Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). She further suggested that their inaction may have cost them critical support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.“Leave it to the GOP to push their biggest donor away,” Loomer wrote. “All they had to do was codify the DOGE cuts and they could have had unlimited funding for the midterms. They somehow managed to F that up,” she added.In her post, Loomer was referring to Musk’s recent announcement to step down from DOGE and his advisory role in the Trump administration. The Tesla CEO has been leading the DOGE task force to cut federal waste and streamlining government spending. He later expressed public disappointment over the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which failed to reflect the aggressive cuts he had championed.“Now @elonmusk is pissed and walking away. Can’t really blame him,” Loomer added.Musk’s departure marks a significant shift for the GOP, which has leaned heavily on his financial and technological influence in recent years. With the midterms approaching and party divisions deepening, Loomer’s post reflects a growing frustration among right-wing influencers over what they see as a squandered opportunity to secure both policy wins and campaign funding.The post comes amid rising tensions between Musk and some of Trump’s top advisers, including those who publicly defended the controversial spending bill.","Laura Loomer has slammed the Republican Party for driving away Elon Musk, whom she termed as ‘their biggest donor’ In a post on social media X, she criticized Republican Party, popularly known as Grand Old Party ( GOP ) for failing to codify spending cuts proposed under Department of Government Efficiency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121515936,imgsize-29520,width-400,resizemode-4/Now-Elon-Musk-is-pissed-and-says-angry-Laura-Loomer-on-Republicans-for-tiff-with-Tesla-CEO.jpg"
Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

The smuggled North Korean smartphone (Source: BBC)

Digital underground fights back in information war

Regime profits from illegal smartphone trade

A smartphone smuggled out of North Korea has exposed the regime's sophisticated digital control system that automatically censors South Korean words, takes secret screenshots every five minutes, and warns users against forbidden language, revealing how Kim Jong Un is gaining ground in an information war against the South.The device, obtained by the BBC through Seoul-based Daily NK, appears identical to standard smartphones but operates as a surveillance tool disguised as consumer technology. When users type "" oppa ,""a South Korean slang term for boyfriend, the phone auto-corrects it to ""comrade"" and displays a warning that the word should only refer to siblings. Similarly, "" South Korea "" automatically changes to ""puppet state,"" reflecting North Korean propaganda.Most disturbing is the phone's covert surveillance feature: it captures screenshots every five minutes and stores them in a secret folder accessible only to authorities, not users. This creates a comprehensive digital record of every user activity for government monitoring.""Smartphones are now part and parcel of the way North Korea tries to indoctrinate people,"" Martyn Williams, a North Korean technology expert at the Stimson Center, told the BBC. He warned that North Korea is ""starting to gain the upper hand"" in the information war.While Kim Jong Un's smartphone surveillance system demonstrates the regime's growing technological sophistication, a small but determined community of North Korean hackers is mounting resistance by jailbreaking government-approved phones. According to a 2022 report by human rights organization Lumen and the Stimson Center, these digital rebels, often educated at elite universities like Kim Il Sung University, use USB connections and Windows PCs to install unauthorized software that bypasses censorship controls.The jailbreakers primarily seek access to forbidden South Korean dramas, K-pop music, and unapproved apps, the very content Kim's smartphone restrictions are designed to block. Some operate commercial services, helping others remove restrictions from their devices. Their activities have prompted new laws specifically targeting ""phone manipulation programs,"" indicating that despite the regime's apparent upper hand in the information war, authorities remain concerned about this underground resistance.North Korea's smartphone industry itself violates international sanctions, generating significant revenue for the regime. An estimated six million North Koreans, a quarter of the population, now own mobile phones, with basic devices costing $100-$400 despite average monthly earnings of just $100.Analysis of North Korean phones by Reuters reveals they contain Taiwanese semiconductors, Chinese batteries, and modified Android operating systems, all imported despite 2017 UN sanctions prohibiting mobile hardware imports. The phones are manufactured by Chinese companies like Gionee using components from MediaTek and Toshiba, though these companies deny direct business with North Korea.This digital infrastructure supports North Korea's informal market economy while providing the regime with unprecedented surveillance capabilities and sanctions-busting revenue streams, demonstrating how authoritarian governments can weaponize consumer technology for social control. As Williams warned, North Korea is ""starting to gain the upper hand"" in the information war.","A smartphone smuggled out of North Korea has exposed the regime's sophisticated digital control system.

Funding issues and more



Cost-cutting measures taken by Good Glamm

Beauty and content commerce startup Good Glamm Group has delayed employee salaries for the second consecutive month. According to a report by Economic Times, the company delayed the salaries due to the ongoing financial struggles. The company, which had earlier assured staff that April and May salaries would be disbursed together in June, has failed to credit payments as of June 3, leaving employees in uncertainty.The delay has also affected former employees, whose full and final settlements remain unpaid, adding to the financial strain. “April and May salaries were supposed to come together, but that doesn’t seem likely to happen anytime soon. At this point, it’s obvious to everyone that it’s because of funding,” an employee told ET.Good Glamm has been struggling to secure fresh funding, with anticipated investments failing to materialise since January. In an effort to maintain liquidity, the company has been exploring the sale of several portfolio brands, including Organic Harvest, which may be sold back to its original founders.The financial uncertainty has triggered a wave of employee exits, including the departure of Kartik Rao, the group’s former chief people officer, who recently joined AI-driven recruitment platform Vahan.ai.Freelancers working with Good Glamm have also raised concerns over delayed payments. Babita Bharati, a freelance copywriter for The Moms Co, shared on LinkedIn that she is yet to receive her full payment of Rs 18,100, citing repeated delays due to pending investor funding.As part of its restructuring efforts, Good Glamm shut down its Vasant Kunj office in New Delhi earlier this year, temporarily relocating operations to Greater Kailash before shifting to a remote work model.The company has also been in advanced talks to sell MissMalini Entertainment, its media and influencer talent management arm, to marketing agency Creativefuel. Earlier this year, it sold Sirona, a feminine hygiene brand, back to its founders for Rs 150 crore, significantly lower than the Rs 450 crore it had paid to acquire the brand.Investor confidence in Good Glamm has been shaken, with representatives from Accel, Prosus Ventures, and Bessemer Venture Partners resigning from the company’s board in January. The company raised $30 million in March 2024 to support working capital needs, but a larger funding round remains elusive.","Good Glamm Group has delayed employee salaries for the second consecutive month.

"TSMC suspends new factory in Japan due to traffic jams; tells government, 'we’ll delay the construction until ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tsmc-suspends-new-factory-in-japan-factory-due-to-traffic-jams-tells-government-well-delay-the-construction-until-/articleshow/121598563.cms,"TSMC says worried about local residents

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) CEO CC Wei attributed delays in expanding its operations in southwestern Japan to worsening traffic congestion. According to a report in Bloomberg, Wei confirmed that the construction of a second plant in Japan is facing minor delays. While TSMC has primarily operated from Taiwan, it established its first Japanese factory after receiving significant incentives from Tokyo.The first TSMC plant in Japan, operational since last year, has boosted the local economy but strained the rural infrastructure, leading to housing and service shortages and extended commute times. “We have created too big an impact on the local traffic. I have experienced that in person. For what used to take a 10-15 min drive, it now takes almost an hour,” Wei told reporters after a shareholders’ meeting in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Tuesday, as quoted by Bloomberg. He added, “We told the Japanese government we’ll delay the construction until the traffic improves. They said they’ll make improvements as soon as possible.”Wei did not specify the duration of the delay.As the world’s leading contract chipmaker, TSMC is central to the global tech supply chain, producing advanced chips for Apple’s iPhones and Nvidia’s AI servers. Governments worldwide, from the U.S. to Europe, have sought TSMC’s investment, especially after pandemic-era chip shortages disrupted production across industries like automotive and consumer electronics.The planned second factory in Kumamoto Prefecture, initially expected to begin construction in early 2025, is critical to Japan’s goal of revitalizing its semiconductor industry and attracting talent to an aging nation. However, the local infrastructure has struggled to accommodate the influx of workers from TSMC’s first plant, even as the company’s U.S. expansion reduces pressure on Japanese production. “This will become negative for the area, for the local government, but I am most worried it will become negative for local residents,” Wei reportedly said. “So we told the Japanese government to improve the traffic first.”Japan’s chief government spokesman, Yoshimasa Hayashi, responded, stating, “Heightened uncertainty in the global economy, along with challenges including the lack of domestic infrastructure and labor can lead to hesitation among private companies thinking of investing,” according to Bloomberg. He emphasized Tokyo’s commitment to improving conditions to attract foreign investment and talent.The delay in Japan echoes earlier challenges TSMC faced in launching its U.S. facilities in Arizona, though progress has since been made. On Tuesday, TSMC executives noted that demand for AI chips continues to outpace supply. Wei reiterated the company’s April forecast of mid-20% revenue growth for 2025, despite margin pressures from a strengthening Taiwanese dollar. TSMC expects record profits this year.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) CEO CC Wei attributed delays in expanding its operations in southwestern Japan to worsening traffic congestion.

TSMC CEO denies rumours of setting up plants in Middle East

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has said that the U.S. tariffs were having some effect on its business, but strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips continues to outpace supply. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholders meeting in Hsinchu, Chief Executive C.C. Wei said the issue of tariffs had been discussed with U.S. officials. However, he stressed that TSMC had not seen any major changes in customer behavior so far.""Tariffs do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly. That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters. TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down,"" Wei explained.""If demand drops, TSMC's business could be affected. But I can assure you that AI demand has always been very strong and it's consistently outpacing supply.""TSMC, a major supplier to tech giants like Apple and Nvidia, has been caught in the crosshairs of global trade tensions driven by U.S. policy. The company has committed $165 billion to build new factories in the U.S., but some of the equipment it uses is made in Asia, raising concerns over added costs due to tariffs.""The U.S. commerce department said this is open for discussion, but how long that will take remains unclear,"" Wei said.""The real point is that we are in active communication, because only through understanding can they realise the consequences.""Wei also recalled a conversation with President Donald Trump , during which he raised concerns about meeting investment deadlines.""He said, 'Mr Wei, do your best, that's good enough.'""Addressing rumors about TSMC setting up chip plants in the Middle East, Wei said the company had no such plans.""It's not very likely we will have customers there,"" he stated.On the domestic front, Wei noted that a stronger Taiwan dollar has hurt the company's profitability.""The currency appreciation reduced our gross margin by more than 3 percentage points,"" he said.TSMC also faces geopolitical challenges, particularly rising tensions between China and Taiwan. Wei acknowledged these risks but said such matters are beyond the company’s control.""If something happens that we don't want to happen, it's a matter for governments, not for TSMC alone,"" he said.Despite these concerns, TSMC remains optimistic about its outlook, especially with strong AI-related chip demand driving growth.",Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has said that the U.S. tariffs were having some effect on its business.

On June 1, 2025, Ukraine launched a sweeping drone offensive, codenamed Operation Spiderweb targeting Russian air bases housing nuclear-capable long-range bombers. Over 100 drones struck facilities across Russia, from Murmansk above the Arctic Circle to the Amur region, 8,000 kilometers from Ukraine. The operation, marked by explosions across multiple time zones, underscored the growing role of drones in modern warfare.Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, in November 2024, Schmidt urged the U.S. to rethink its military priorities, suggesting it replace traditional tank fleets with advanced drones. “I read somewhere that the U.S. had thousands of tanks stored somewhere. Give them away. Buy a drone instead,” he said, citing Ukraine’s success in using affordable drones to counter Russia’s numerical and air superiority. Schmidt’s advocacy draws from his leadership of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which in 2021 concluded that AI would transform warfare across all domains.The attack highlights a strategic shift advocated by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt , who has emerged as a key figure in integrating AI-driven technology into military strategy. Schmidt, founder of the military startup White Stork, is developing AI-powered "" Kamikaze drones "" for Ukraine. These drones, designed to loiter and strike targets autonomously, can operate in GPS-denied environments, making them ideal for Ukraine’s battlefield needs. Named after a bird common in Ukraine, White Stork’s drones aim to counter Russian forces by destroying high-value targets like tanks, which Schmidt notes can be neutralized by a $5,000 drone despite costing millions.In a 2023 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Schmidt called Kamikaze drones—costing as little as $400 and carrying small explosives—“the most important” innovation for defeating Russia and future adversaries. Ukraine’s recent operation exemplifies this vision, showcasing how drones can strike deep into enemy territory, reshaping the battlefield.Since leaving Google in 2018, where he served as CEO from 2001 to 2011 and later as executive chairman of Alphabet, Schmidt has bridged Silicon Valley and the Pentagon, championing AI-driven defense solutions. His work with White Stork and his public statements signal a broader push for militaries worldwide to embrace autonomous technology as the future of warfare.","Ukraine launched a sweeping drone offensive, codenamed Operation Spiderweb targeting Russian air bases housing nuclear-capable long-range bombers.

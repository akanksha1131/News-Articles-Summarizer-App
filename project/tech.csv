"Starlink, Jio, Airtel face further delay in satellite internet rollout amid TRAI–DoT standoff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/starlink-jio-airtel-face-further-delay-in-satellite-internet-rollout-amid-traidot-standoff/articleshow/125988153.cms,"DoT proposes to increase spectrum prices





Elon Musk’s Starlink, Jio and Airtel may have to wait longer than expected to launch satellite based internet services in India. According to a report by Economic Times, commercial rollout may take longer because of a standoff between the telecom regulator and the department of telecommunications (DoT) over spectrum pricing. The report quotes industry executives who said that the process could potentially take another 3-6 months amid upcoming personnel changes at the DoT and industry interference.Till date, Starlink, Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite have completed most of the licensing and space-regulatory steps, including obtaining the Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence, and approvals from space-regulatory body In-SPACe.However, commercial launch depends on spectrum allocation, pricing rules and compliance with security and capacity rules.Shivaji Chatterjee, CEO and managing director of Hughes Communications India told the publication: “The current spectrum pricing proposals, including the disagreements between Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) and DoT regarding LEO (low earth orbit satellite) spectrum pricing must first be reviewed by a standing committee.The proposal then moves to the digital communications commission (DCC) for approval”.Once approved, the matter will go to the telecom minister or union cabinet, he said. After the ministerial approval is granted, the wireless planning and coordination wing (WPC) will create specific rules. These rules will eventually be put out for public consultation for 30 days.“This stage is critical as terrestrial telecom operators may attempt to impede the process during the feedback window,” Chatterjee said.Initially, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had proposed a flat rate of 4% of adjusted gross revenues to be charged for spectrum allocation. But the DoT recently proposed to raise charges to 5% of AGR with a 1% discount if they meet specific rural rollout targets.An industry executive said the government’s move to increase spectrum charges from the earlier suggested rate may be meant to calm telecom operators, who have been asking for a level playing field. The person added that raising the fee from 4% to 5% would not make a major financial difference for the government. “It was mainly a symbolic step to show that the DoT was responding to telco concerns,” the executive told ET.","Commercial launch depends on spectrum allocation, pricing rules and compliance with security and capacity rules.

STMicroelectronics has disclosed the numbers involving the massive scale of its partnership with Elon Musk’s SpaceX .

Amazon layoffs continue, as the company is cutting more jobs. According to a report in Geekwire, Amazon has filed a new notice with Washington state. As per the filing with the State government, the company is cutting 84 jobs and that these job cuts are unrelated to the 14,000 corporate layoffs it announced globally in October. In a statement to the publication, the company said that each of its businesses regularly reviews its organizational structure and may make adjustments as a result. Terming it a ""routine process"", the company spokesperson also confirmed that these job cuts are not tied to broader workforce actions.Amazon filed notice with Washinton authourities as a new State law requires companies/employers to disclose all terminations occurring within 90 days of a prior notice under the State’s new version of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, known as the WARN Act.“We’ve informed a relatively small number of employees that their roles will be eliminated as the result of individual business decisions,” said Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser. “We don’t make decisions like this lightly,” he added, noting that the company is providing affected employees with 90 days of full pay and benefits, transitional health coverage, and job placement services.What Amazon filing saysAccording to Amazon filing, the separations are scheduled to occur between February 2 and February 23, 2026, across more than 30 Seattle and Bellevue office locations, plus six remote workers based in Washington.They reportedly include software development engineers, program managers, recruiters, HR specialists, and UX designers, ranging from entry-level to directors and principals.Amazon noted in the filing that employees were notified starting in early November and received at least 89 days’ advance notice, exceeding the 60-day minimum required under the law. Those who find internal transfers before their separation date won’t be laid off.In October, Amazon said that it will lay off 2,303 corporate employees in Washington state, primarily in its Seattle and Bellevue offices. The company revealed the same in a filing with the State Employment Security Department. The number provided the first geographic breakdown of the company’s 14,000 global job cuts.A detailed list included with the State filing showed impacted roles, including software engineers, program managers, product managers, and designers, as well as a significant number of recruiters and human resources staff.Amazon announced the cuts on October 27 as part of a larger push by CEO Andy Jassy to streamline the company. Jassy said in June that the increased use of artificial intelligence tools would likely lead to further job cuts, particularly through automating repetitive and routine tasks. In a memo from HR chief Beth Galetti, the company signaled that further cutbacks will continue into 2026.","Amazon has filed a new notice with Washington state.

AI at work: Survey shows which jobs are using AI the most,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-at-work-survey-shows-which-jobs-are-using-ai-the-most/articleshow/125988018.cms,"





Knowledge-based jobs lead AI use

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

Frontline industries lag behind

Managers and leaders use AI more often





Uncertainty about organisational AI strategy

How employees are using AI at work

AI use grows, but daily adoption remains limited





Artificial intelligence is becoming a regular part of working life around the world, but its adoption remains uneven across the labour market. According to the latest Gallup workforce survey, nearly half of American employees now use AI at work at least a few times a year, a figure that continues to rise quarter by quarter. While usage is growing overall, the data show clear differences between industries, job roles, and levels of seniority, revealing where AI has taken hold and where it remains marginal.Employees in knowledge-intensive roles are far more likely to use AI than those in frontline positions. Gallup found that three-quarters of workers in technology or information systems roles reported using AI at least a few times a year. Usage was also high in finance and professional services, where more than half of employees said AI was part of their work. These roles typically involve data analysis, writing, coding or research, areas where AI tools are easiest to integrate.In contrast, AI use remains significantly lower in sectors dominated by frontline work. Only about a third of employees in retail reported using AI at work, while healthcare and manufacturing showed similarly modest adoption.Frontline roles such as shop floor sales assistants, cashiers, warehouse operatives, nurses, healthcare aides, machine operators and assembly-line workers typically rely on physical presence and manual tasks, limiting opportunities to apply digital AI tools in day-to-day duties.The survey highlights a clear gap between senior staff and individual contributors. Leaders and managers are more likely to use AI frequently, often a few times a week or more, compared with frontline employees and junior staff. This reflects both greater access to AI tools and closer involvement in planning, reporting and decision-making tasks where AI can add immediate value.Despite rising usage, many employees remain unclear about whether their organisation has formally adopted AI. Gallup found that a significant share of workers, particularly individual contributors and frontline staff, said they did not know if their employer had implemented AI technology. This suggests that some employees are using personal or unofficial AI tools without clear guidance or awareness of company strategy.Among those who use AI, the most common applications include consolidating information, generating ideas and learning new skills. Chatbots and virtual assistants are the most widely used tools, followed by AI-powered writing and editing software. More advanced tools, such as coding assistants and data analytics platforms, remain relatively rare and are mostly used by employees who rely on AI frequently.While overall AI use continues to expand, daily use is still confined to a small portion of the workforce. Gallup’s findings suggest that broader adoption depends less on access to technology and more on leadership support, clear communication and practical guidance. Without these, AI is likely to remain concentrated in specific jobs rather than becoming a universal workplace tool.","Artificial intelligence is becoming a regular part of working life around the world, but its adoption remains uneven across the labour market.

Netflix is pushing through to seal a deal over Warner Bros Discovery's assets. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the co-CEOs of the US streaming giant, Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos, have written to staff to reaffirm that commitment. In the letter (as seen by Reuters), the chief executives have sought to reassure employees that the business remains committed to continuing Warner Bros'of releasing movies in theatres once the deal closes. The letter came after Netflix announced a $72 billion equity deal to acquire Warner Bros' film, TV, and streaming assets, which was subsequently complicated by a hostile $108.4 billion enterprise bid for the whole company from Paramount Skydance.the co-CEOs wrote in the letter sent to Netflix employees, the Reuters report claimed.

Also, Paramount stated it won’t cut spending in content production and will keep both studio divisions separate.The company has argued that it must acquire WBD to compete with Google’s YouTube, claiming the combined company would still trail YouTube in US viewership.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why despite being the CEO of world's most-valuable company, sense of uncertainty and insecurity doesn't leave him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-despite-being-the-ceo-of-worlds-most-valuable-company-sense-of-uncertainty-and-insecurity-doesnt-leave-him/articleshow/125883149.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading his company to a $5 trillion valuation, lives in constant anxiety, a fear rooted in a near-bankruptcy experience. Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

How to apply for e-passport





The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0). With the new system, the government aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders. While the existing ones remain valid till their expiry, anyone applying for a passport will get a chip-enabled passport by default, irrespective of whether they apply in India or abroad.As explained by the external affairs ministry in a press release, the e-Passport is a hybrid passport that combines both paper and electronic elements. It features an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and an antenna, which store and secure the holder’s data in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.Critical information printed on the data page is also stored electronically on the chip, enabling enhanced security and authentication, the ministry says. Going forward, all newly issued passports will be e-Passports, while existing non-electronic passports will remain valid until their expiry, it added.As mentioned above, any Indian citizen who is eligible for a regular passport can apply for e-passport.The process of applying for an e-passport is the same as that of applying for a regular passport. Applicants are required to first register on the official Passport Seva portal using their personal details. After completing the registration, they must fill in the online application form carefully and pay the prescribed fee through the available payment options.Once the payment is completed, applicants are required to book an appointment at a nearby Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra, based on their location and slot availability. On the scheduled date, the applicant must visit the selected centre in person for document verification.During the appointment, biometric details of the applicant are captured. This includes taking fingerprints and a photograph, which are used for identity verification and are later embedded securely into the e-passport’s electronic chip.After the verification process is completed and the application is cleared, the e-passport is printed with the embedded chip that stores the holder’s biometric and personal details.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Dimon urged workers to focus on human skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and communication to stay relevant in the future workforce. He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Jamie Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Starlink’s residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000

SpaceX Gateway network to span across six cities, and Bengaluru office expands





Starlink has officially denied that Indian pricing, calling the incident a technical glitch rather than an intentional reveal. Lauren Dreyer, Vice President of Starlink Business Operations, clarified in a post on X that the company's India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.She explained that a configuration error caused internal dummy test data to briefly appear publicly, which was quickly corrected once discovered. Dreyer emphasized that Starlink has not announced official pricing for India and any figures currently circulating online are inaccurate. The company remains focused on obtaining final government approvals before launching service in the country, and both the website and ordering system will stay inactive until the regulatory process is complete.Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees. The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications. These relay installations are essential for maintaining low-latency connections and service reliability across India's varied geography.The company posted four specialist positions at its Bengaluru office in October, recruiting talent in payments, accounting, treasury, and tax operations as part of infrastructure expansion. This direct-to-consumer strategy distinguishes Starlink from competitors concentrating on enterprise clients, potentially reshaping internet accessibility in regions where fiber deployment remains economically unviable.","Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India. residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000 per month.

Musk's Daughter Vivian SLAMS His 'Masculinity Expectations'; Says Her Birth Was 'A Monetary Transaction'

Public figures and the escalating battle over gender narratives









Elon Musk is once again in the headlines and at the centre of a social media storm when he posted a very forthright definition of a woman on X. The head of Tesla and SpaceX took to social media and described a woman simply as someone with a womb and this definition went viral in a matter of minutes. In no time at all, this definition had ignited a barometer of reactions on social media, with people both responding in support of Musk's comments and railing against them. The whole episode brings to light how gender has become a very divisive topic on social media, especially when such statements come from people in positions of influence. The controversy underscores platform amplification effects, cultural sensitivities, and how celebrity statements rapidly shape online discourse across diverse global audiences.Musk’s comment went straight to the point with: ""If you have a womb, you’re a woman. Otherwise, you’re not."" The directness and clarity of this statement were key in making it go viral on X, with people sharing screenshots, re-posts, and reactions to Musk’s comment. Those in support of Musk celebrated such a comment as an affirmation of a biological distinction, where they did not think sex stereotypes ought to be blurred in conversations in society.Musk’s response of ""Seriously"" to a comment in support of him further pushed all this.Critics were quick to question this claim on biological grounds. Some people brought up the case of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, where girls are born without a uterus or with an underdeveloped uterus. Some people observed that biology is not a simple matter of defining an organ but a whole series of factors, including chromosomes, hormones, and developmental differences. Such comments questioned the simplicity of Musk’s statement.The controversy did not arise in a vacuum, but in a sequence of statements Musk recently made concerning his transgender daughter, which have already sparked criticism for their wording. Furthermore, this latest controversy can be linked to statements by California Governor Gavin Newsom in support of trans rights, providing a political dimension to this cyber discourse. Such occurrences can be attributed to a cultural split over gender definitions. The strength of this response to Musk’s status update demonstrates just how potent outspoken leaders can be in molding and fueling public discourse.While some supporters saw this status update as a voice of clarity in a confusing debate, for others it embodied a sense of ‘othering and misunderstanding.’ Either way, this situation exemplifies how social media is becoming an increasingly central front in a series of debating-ground battles concerning all things science, culture, and ideology.",Elon Musk's definition of women sparks rapid spread and scientific pushback. The Tesla and SpaceX head described a woman simply as someone with a womb and this definition went viral in a matter of minutes. The whole episode brings to light how gender has become a very divisive topic on social media.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125976977,imgsize-23318,width-400,resizemode-4/if-you-have-a-womb-elon-musks-words-set-social-media-ablaze-over-the-definition-of-women.jpg"

Salesforce CEO thanks man who disarmed Bondi Beach gunman

Video of al Ahmed disarming Bondi Beach gunman goes viral





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has condemned the Bondi Beach shooting in Sydney, calling it an “antisemitic terrorist attack”. The attack that targeted people celebrating Hanukah has killed at least 16 people after a Pakistan-origin father-son duo opened fire. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Benioff said he was “heartbroken” by the violence, which left several people dead and others injured during the Jewish festival gathering.I am heartbroken by the antisemitic terrorist attack on Jews celebrating Chanukah at Bondi Beach,” Benioff wrote. “My thoughts are with the victims, their families, and all of our Australian Ohana,” he added.In the post, he also thanked Ahmed al-Ahmed, the man who tackled and disarmed one of the attackers during the incident. Marc Benioff praised his actions as an example of bravery during a moment of crisis. “Thank you to Ahmed al-Ahmed for his incredible bravery—turning tragedy into a powerful testament that human courage triumphs over hate,” he said.Benioff ended his post with a message of solidarity, saying, “May the One who brings peace grant peace to all.”Meanwhile, footage of the scene shows al-Ahmed rushing and leaping towards one of the shooters, and nabbing the gun from his hands has gone viral on the internet. Taking about the incident, Mohamed Fateh Al Ahmed told reporters:""When he saw people laying on the ground and the blood everywhere, immediately his conscience and his soul compelled him to pounce on one of the terrorists and rid him of his weapon"".Mustafa al-Asaad, al Ahemd’s cousin told the Al Araby television network that al-Ahmed intervened as a “humanitarian act”. “When he saw people dying and their families being shot, he couldn’t bear to see people dying,” he said.“It was a humanitarian act, more than anything else. It was a matter of conscience … He’s very proud that he saved even one life.“When he saw this scene, people dying of gunfire, he told me, ‘I couldn’t bear this. God gave me strength. I believe I’m going to stop this person killing people’.”","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has condemned the Bondi Beach shooting in Sydney, calling it an “antisemitic terrorist attack” The attack that targeted people celebrating Hanukah has killed at least 16 people after a Pakistan-origin father-son duo opened fire.

What Mark Zuckerberg looks for in a candidate







Microsoft AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, has weighed in on the competition for top AI talent in Silicon Valley, specifically questioning the strategy of rivals like Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook. Suleyman criticised Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s approach of offering multi-million dollar pay packages, saying that he focused on individuals rather than team building.“I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,” he said on Bloomberg Podcasts, while talking about the 100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers. Reports even claimed a few high-level AI researchers also got signing bonuses of up to $250 million.Suleyman also indicated that Microsoft AI will never match these astronomical figures. “I don't think anyone’s matching those things,” Suleyman said, highlighting that the company will instead prioritise selective hiring, strong team culture and incremental growth.Over the last few months, reporters have said that Meta has ‘poached’ engineers and top AI researchers for millions of dollars.Even Microsoft hired Suleyman from Google DeepMind, however, the executive pointed out ‘no poach’ agreement.“There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal. People can go work for whoever they want to work for,” he said.Earlier this year, Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, and hired its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Similarly, Google also invested $2.4 billion to acquire the leaders of AI coding platform Windsurf.In October this year, a report by Fortune pointed out the type of talent Zuckerberg likes and is likely to hire. According to the report, for Zuckerberg, skills outweigh a traditional college degree as looks for people who have mastered a specific skill and demonstrated the ability to apply it across various business“If people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in the art of learning something and taking it to an excellent level, which is generally pretty applicable to other things,” Zuckerberg told Bloomberg last year.","Microsoft AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, has weighed in on the competition for top AI talent in Silicon Valley.

Michael Nicolls of SpaceX highlighted a critical lack of coordination and data sharing among satellite operators as the primary risk in space. This incident underscores the growing need for better communication in orbital operations.

""comes from the lack of coordination between satellite operators.""

""no coordination or deconfliction""

""do not share ephemeris for their satellites""

""needs to change.""

“When satellite operators do not share ephemeris for their satellites, dangerously close approaches can occur in space. A few days ago, nine satellites were deployed from a launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwestern China.

As far as we know, no coordination or deconfliction with existing satellites operating in space was performed, resulting in a 200-meter close approach between one of the deployed satellites and STARLINK-6079 (56120) at 560 km altitude.

Most of the risk of operating in space comes from the lack of coordination between satellite operators - this needs to change.”

""Our team is currently in contact for more details. All CAS Space launches select their launch windows using the ground-based space awareness system to avoid collisions with known satellites/debris. This is a mandatory procedure.

We will work on identifying the exact details and provide assistance as the LSP.""

""If confirmed, this incident occurred nearly 48 hours after payload separation, by which time the launch mission had long concluded. CAS Space will coordinate with satellite operators to proceed. This calls for re-establishing collaborations between the two New Space ecosystems.""

""We appreciate the responsiveness and look forward to engaging in coordination for future launches.

Establishing data sharing between all satellite operators is critical.""

“A quick analysis of Space Force public tracking data suggests this was object 67001. We don't know which of the Lijian-1 payloads is 67001.”

What the lawsuit alleges

Microsoft may have to pay over £2 billion





Software giant Microsoft is reportedly facing a legal case in the UK over alleged unfair cloud licensing practices. Competition lawyer Dr Maria Luisa Stasi has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of over charging UK organisations to run Windows Server on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and other rival cloud platforms. Notably, the case was originally filed in December 2024. Microsoft then dismissed the case as ""an opportunistic attempt by a law firm and its private funders to piggy-back on baseless complaints Google has made and which we've all addressed or rebutted.""According to a TechRadar report, the case is being heard by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), with around 59,000 British organizations included in the proposed class. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft has misused its dominance to force customers towards its Azure cloud platform.“Microsoft’s alleged Licensing Abuses have been highly successful in encouraging businesses which are contracting for cloud computing services for the first time to choose Microsoft Azure over rival providers,” the lawsuit claims.“It is alleged it is these users – i.e. businesses which have chosen not to switch, but instead continue to operate Windows Server on Listed Providers – which have been harmed by Microsoft’s conduct, and which comprise the Proposed Class,” it added.As per the proposed class-action, the average loss per organisation is estimated to be in the tens of thousands of pounds. If the case goes against the company, the total compensation could exceed £2 billion.The lawsuit, as stated in the official document, “seeks to recover an aggregate award of damages currently estimated as worth between c. £1.7 billion and £2.1 billion”.","Microsoft is reportedly facing a legal case in the UK over alleged unfair cloud licensing practices.

PC gamers may soon receive one of the most generous holiday giveaways. A massive leak has allegedly revealed 14 blockbuster titles, including Red Dead Redemption 2 and Detroit: Become Human, are set to be offered for free on the Epic Games Store (EGS). The list appeared on a Chinese social media platform and outlines the full schedule of Epic’s anticipated Holiday Giveaway, which began earlier this week with the announcement that Hogwarts Legacy would be free to claim until December 18.According to Notebookcheck, Epic Games is making an aggressive move to compete in the PC market against rivals like Steam and Amazon Prime Gaming by offering some of the biggest titles at no cost to users. Here’s a list of games that are said to be available for free on Epic Games Store.While the potential lineup has generated massive buzz among the PC gaming community online, gamers are advised to not fully believe the leak as they may be untrue. Some analysts have reportedly pointed out that a few of the listed titles, such as Red Dead Redemption 2, are not currently available for purchase on the Epic Games Store. This means that they must be added to the platform in conjunction with the giveaway.Notably, the veracity of this list can be confirmed soon because as per the list, the next free big game that is scheduled to go live on December 18 is Jurassic World: Evolution 2.","A massive leak has allegedly revealed 14 blockbuster titles, including Red Dead Redemption 2 and Detroit: Become Human, are set to be offered for free on the Epic Games Store.

He is now focusing on AI agents, rebranding products under the 'Agentforce' name. This strategic shift signals a major investment in autonomous software. Salesforce is betting billions on this new technology, aiming for significant revenue growth by 2030.

' Agentforce ' replaces two decades of cloud branding





Salesforce and Marc Benioff bets billions on AI agent technology





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has banished the word ""cloud"" from his vocabulary—a departure for the man who pioneered cloud computing in 1999 and built a quarter-trillion-dollar empire around the technology. The shift signals how dramatically the software industry's conversation has evolved in the age of artificial intelligence.Benioff revealed he completely stopped using the term after focus groups showed customers no longer want to hear about cloud technology—they want to discuss AI agents instead, Business Insider reported. The CEO avoided mentioning ""cloud"" entirely during his keynote address at the company's annual Dreamforce conference in October, a first in the event's history.""I dropped the word cloud totally,"" Benioff told Business Insider in a recent interview. ""We learned in focus groups customers don't talk about cloud anymore. They just want to talk about their agentic interface.""The rebranding extends far beyond semantics. Salesforce has systematically renamed many of its flagship products under the ""Agentforce"" moniker—its AI agent software. Sales Cloud became ""Agentforce Sales,"" Service Cloud transformed into ""Agentforce Service,"" and Platform morphed into ""Agentforce 365 Platform.""Even Data Cloud, the company's data platform, was rechristened ""Data 360.""According to Business Insider report Benioff confirmed the company might even consider renaming Salesforce itself to Agentforce. ""That would not shock me,"" he said when asked about the possibility.The pivot reflects Salesforce's massive bet on AI agents, autonomous software that can handle customer service, sales tasks, and other business functions traditionally performed by human workers. The company recently laid off 4,000 customer support workers as its Agentforce technology assumed more responsibilities.During the company's latest earnings call, Benioff announced Salesforce has closed more than 18,500 Agentforce deals, with 9,500 being paid transactions—up 50% quarter-over-quarter. Token usage hit nearly 540 billion in October alone, climbing 25% month-over-month.The strategy appears central to Salesforce's ambitious target of reaching $60 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2030, up from a forecasted $41.5 billion for the current fiscal year. The company recently bolstered this vision with an $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, which builds AI tools for managing corporate data.Despite initial investor skepticism, the AI push showed positive signs in Salesforce’s recent earnings report, prompting the company to raise its revenue forecast.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has banished the word 'cloud' from his vocabulary.

This move cancels $264 million in debt, allowing iRobot to continue operations as a private company. Intense competition from Chinese firms and the collapse of an Amazon acquisition deal led to the company's downfall after 35 years.

Chinese competition and tariffs squeeze profits

Amazon deal collapse proves final blow





iRobot, the company behind the Roomba vacuum cleaner, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday in Delaware court after 35 years of operation. The robotics manufacturer will be acquired by Shenzhen PICEA Robotics, its primary supplier and lender.Under the restructuring agreement, Picea will take complete ownership of the reorganized company and cancel approximately $264 million in debt, including $190 million from a 2023 loan and $74 million owed under manufacturing agreements. The company's common stock will be eliminated from exchanges, and iRobot will operate as a private entity. The deal allows iRobot to continue operations without disruption to customer support, app functionality, or supply chain relationships.Founded in 1990 by three MIT roboticists, iRobot achieved massive success after launching the Roomba in 2002, eventually selling over 50 million robots. The company went public in 2005 and reached a valuation of $3.56 billion during the pandemic in 2021. However, earnings declined steadily since then due to intensifying competition from lower-priced Chinese rivals like Ecovacs Robotics and supply chain disruptions.Despite maintaining strong market positions with 42% share in the U.S. and 65% in Japan, iRobot struggled to maintain profitability. The company generated $682 million in revenue in 2024 but faced mounting pressures from price competition and a 46% tariff on Vietnamese imports that added $23 million to costs in 2025. By its third quarter, iRobot's cash reserves had dwindled to $24.8 million with no additional capital sources available.The final blow came when Amazon's proposed $1.7 billion acquisition collapsed in January 2024 after European regulators threatened to block the deal over competition concerns. Amazon paid a $94 million breakup fee, but iRobot immediately laid off 31% of its workforce and CEO Colin Angle resigned. The company's stock plummeted more than 90% over five years, leaving it valued at just $140 million before the bankruptcy filing.","iRobot will be acquired by its supplier, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics.

US embassy warning on removing social media information from Visa application





Following its policy to make US visas stricter, the Donald Trump administration is making the US visa-vetting system tighter. The US State Dept announced recently that all H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents will have to undergo social-media screening. So, starting today (December 15), the US government has expanded its screening and vetting procedures for the applicants of H-1B visa program and their dependent H-4 visas. “As of December 15, the Department will expand the requirement that an online presence review be conducted for all H-1B applicants and their dependents, in addition to the students and exchange visitors already subject to this review. To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for H-1B and their dependents (H-4), F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to “public,” said the US State Department in a press release.The State Department has further added that it will use all the available information in visa screening and vetting process in order to identify the visa applicants. “We conduct thorough vetting of all visa applicants, including online presence review of all student and exchange visitor applicants in the F, M, and J nonimmigrant classifications.”According to the US Department of State, the new measures include:Officials emphasised that the changes are designed to strengthen national security while maintaining the integrity of the visa system. “Every visa adjudication is a national security decision. The United States must be vigilant during the visa issuance process to ensure that those applying for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans and our national interests, and that all applicants credibly establish their eligibility for the visa sought, including that they intend to engage in activities consistent with the terms for their admission. A U.S. visa is a privilege, not a right,” added US State Department.In June this year, the US Embassy in India issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department this year. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs they use on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others. The mandate is also for accounts that are no longer active (from the last five years).","The US State Dept announced recently that all H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents will have to undergo social-media screening.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan recently praised India’s incremental progress strategy in the semiconductor manufacturing race. The Intel chief said that he believes India’s semiconductor fabrication effort will be better served by the approach, reports Economic Times. “My recommendation to the Indian government is that this will be the right way to do it, step by step, and then drive profitability and generate cash,” Tan told the publication adding “That will be good.”Lip-Bu Tan further stated that there are “opportunities in the feature-rich process technology, especially with automotive manufacturers like Tata and Mahindra.” “That will be a very good way in terms of power management, image sensor, and automotive-related components that don’t need the most advanced process,” he added.As per the report, Lip-Bu Tan also talked about Intel’s foundry roadmap. He said that the company remains “laser focused on the most advanced 14A technology” – a reference to Intel’s 1.4nm-class process built on High-NA EUV lithography.In another news, multi-billion dollar deals linked to Intel chief have come under attention after new details emerged about the chip maker’s attempted bid for AI chip startup Rivos.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Tan was both Intel CEO and chairman of Rivos when the chipmaker explored a deal. The report quotes three people aware of the matter who said that “Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. ” The board then told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence (AI) to justify a deal.After the board’s response, Tan told one of Intel executives to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos. However, Meta had also expressed interest in buying Rivos, prompting Intel to make an offer. Meta then raised its offer, pushing the deal value to about $4 billion, the report says. Meta announced its acquisition of Rivos in September this year.The Rivos deal is one of the three instances where Intel pursued deals involving companies in which Tan holds stakes. Since his appointment, Tan has taken direct control of Intel’s investment arm – Intel Capital. Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, sources told Reuters.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan recently praised India’s incremental progress strategy in the semiconductor manufacturing race. The Intel chief said that he believes India's semiconductor fabrication effort will be better served by the approach. In another news, multi-billion dollar deals linked to Intel chief have come under attention after new details emerged about the chip maker's attempted bid for AI chip startup Rivos.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125974022,imgsize-24246,width-400,resizemode-4/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan.jpg"

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman calls Sam Altman ‘courageous’







Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, has now offered a strikingly concise characterizations of two of the most influential figures in the technology industry: Elon Musk and Sam Altman . Speaking to Bloomberg in an interview, Suleyman described Elon Musk as a ‘bulldozer’ and Altman as ‘courageous’ underscoring both admiration and caution in the fast-moving world of artificial intelligence. Suleyman feels that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has got ’superhuman capabilities’. He believes that Musk is also capable of pulling off nearly impossible tasks. On the other hand, talking about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Suleyman said that Altman is courageous as he is growing his data center fleet and he feels that the OpenAI CEO will become a ‘great entrepreneur of our generation’.On being asked how he would describe Elon Musk, Suleyman said, “I guess a bulldozer. He’s kind of got superhuman capabilities to bend reality to his will and has [a] pretty incredible track record. Somehow he mostly manages to pull off what appears to be impossible. [He] probably [has a] different set of values.”Suleyman explained that Musk’s relentless drive and ability to achieve the seemingly impossible earned him the label. Musk’s accomplishments with Tesla and SpaceX, along with his growing political influence, have positioned him as a force who reshapes industries and challenges norms.Musk’s style is often seen as aggressive and uncompromising. Suleyman acknowledged Musk’s capacity to “shape reality” through sheer determination.For Open AI CEO Sam Altman, Suleyman selected the word ‘courageous’. Talking about Altman Sulyeman told Bloomberg, “Oh my God. I guess courageous. He’s obviously growing his data center fleet very aggressively. He may well turn out to be one of the great entrepreneurs of our generation. He’s certainly achieved a lot. He’s building data centers at a faster rate than anyone in the industry, and if he can pull it off, it will be pretty dramatic. ”Suleyman noted that OpenAI CEO is willing to take risks in advancing AI technology and his role in steering OpenAI through both innovation and controversy. He also added that Altman has been central to the rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT.","Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, has offered a strikingly concise characterizations of two of the most influential figures in the technology industry: Elon Musk and Sam Altman.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Nvidia’s chips important for AI boom

“I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security.

President Xi responded positively! $25% will be paid to the United States of America. This policy will support American Jobs, strengthen U.S. Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers.

The Biden Administration forced our Great Companies to spend BILLIONS OF DOLLARS building “degraded” products that nobody wanted, a terrible idea that slowed Innovation, and hurt the American Worker. That Era is OVER! We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI. NVIDIA’s U.S. Customers are already moving forward with their incredible, highly advanced Blackwell chips, and soon, Rubin, neither of which are part of this deal. My Administration will always put America FIRST. The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details, and the same approach will apply to AMD, Intel, and other GREAT American Companies. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,” Wrote Trump.





Nvidia has now pushed back against a report claiming that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, whose breakthrough earlier this year rattled US markets, is secretly using its restricted Blackwell AI chips. Recently, a report published by The Information alleged that DeepSeek has acquired smuggled Blackwell GPUs which the company is using to train its upcoming AI model. These chips are among Nvidia’s most-advanced processors and they have been named from export to China under US trade restrictions which are aimed at maintaining America’s lead in the artificial intelligence race. However, the chipset major has dismissed these claims.“We haven’t seen any substantiation or received tips of ‘phantom data centers’ constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled and reconstructed somewhere else,” an Nvidia spokesperson said told CNBC. “While such smuggling seems far-fetched, we pursue any tip we receive.”The US has banned the export of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, which are considered the company’s most advanced offerings, to China as part of its strategy to maintain a lead in the global AI race.DeepSeek stunned global tech sector with its launched in January 2025, when the company released its R1 model. Analysts noted that R1 was built at a fraction of the cost of U.S. competitors, sparking fears of China’s rapid progress in AI and contributing to a sell-off that wiped billions from US stock markets. In August, DeepSeek hinted that China would soon have its own “next generation” chips to support AI models, raising further concerns about how the country might circumvent US restrictions.Nvidia’s Blackwell chips play an important part in the AI boom. The chips are designed to power everything from large language models to advanced data centres. Their role has made Nvidia’s relationship with China a political flashpoint in Washington.Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Nvidia could ship its H200 chips to “approved customers” in China and elsewhere, provided the U.S. government receives 25% of those sales. The move drew criticism from some lawmakers, highlighting the tension between commercial interests and national security.In the post, Trump wrote that he has informed Chinese President Xi Jinping that the US would allow sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips under a framework which is designed to benefit American workers and tax payers.","The US has banned the export of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips to China as part of its strategy to maintain a lead in the global AI race.

Google tests new Phone app feature that lets urgent calls bypass Do Not Disturb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-tests-new-phone-app-feature-that-lets-urgent-calls-bypass-do-not-disturb/articleshow/125964471.cms,"How Phone by Google’s new feature works





Google announced a new feature for its Phone app earlier this month that will allow callers to surpass Do Not Disturb (DND). According to a report by 9to5Google, Phone by Google’s new “Expressive Calling” feature is beginning to roll out for beta users. Those who have enrolled in the beta can check the availability of the feature via:Phone Settings > General > Expressive Calling (near the bottom).As per the report, the high-level preference (“Enhance calling with visual and haptic feedback”) will be enabled by default. Google is allowing users to decide whether “Urgent call can interrupt Do Not Disturb” is on.According to the report, both parties must have Phone by Google beta (version 203) to get this to work at this stage. Once the feature is available, the calling screen will show a “Mark call as urgent?” card above the usual controls. Users can tap on “Notify.”When you make an urgent call, the person you’re calling will see an “It’s urgent!” alert on their screen along with a flashing siren emoji. If they don’t answer, the call will show an “urgent” tag in their call history.In a separate update, Phone by Google 202 has now moved to the stable release channel. However, features such as the shorter bottom bar and the new “Keep portrait mode” option are still not broadly available. These features remain in beta for now, and may roll out to more users through a server-side update later.",Phone by Google’s new “Expressive Calling” feature is beginning to roll out for beta users.

Paramount to Netflix: Your 'YouTube reason' to buy Warner Brothers is like Coca-Cola justifying it can buy Pepsi because ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/paramount-to-netflix-your-youtube-reason-to-buy-warner-brothers-is-like-coca-cola-justifying-buying-pepsi-because-/articleshow/125965779.cms,"Donald Trump Attacks $72B Netflix–WBD Deal, Demands CNN Be ‘Sold Or Included’ In Mega Merger

Why analysts not convinced with Netflix's 'YouTube reasoning'







Netflix says it must acquire Warner Bros Discovery to compete with YouTube. In fact, YouTube has become a key player in Netflix‘s plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. As the streaming giant Netflix says that even if the company were to acquire Warner Bros. , it would still be behind YouTube in terms of total viewing time as measured by Nielsen. Netflix’s Co-CEO Greg Peters brought up this point while speaking at UBS’ 2025 Global Media and Communications Conference in New York last week. Peters made the statement on the same day when Paramount filed its hostile bid. “We go from 8% of viewed hours today in the United States to 9%. We’re still behind YouTube at 13%,” Peters said, referring to what would happen if the company acquired HBO and HBO Max.The reason Netflix co-CEO specifically pointed out, if Paramount acquired Warner Bros., their newly combined portion of US viewership would jump to 13.8% and that would put them above YouTube is to stress on the point that if Paramount, which accounted for 8.2% of November viewership, purchased all of Warner Bros. Discovery, it would account for 13.8% of all US viewership. That would put the combined companies ahead of both Netflix and YouTube.To sum up, Paramount buying Warner Bros. is a bigger anticompetitive threat than Netflix.“We go from 8% of viewed hours today in the United States to 9%. We’re still behind YouTube at 13%,” he said. “We think that there’s a really strong fundamentals-based case here for why regulators should approve this deal,” Peters added.In response to Netflix co-CEO's comment, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, compared the statement to Coca-Cola justifying a Pepsi purchase because Budweiser also makes beverages. Speaking to CNBC’s David Faber on ""Squawk on the Street"", Ellison said, ""I’m sorry this is like following that analogy for a second, right? Okay, that’s like saying Coke can buy Pepsi, that they’re both beverages because Budweiser is a substitute for Coke. That’s not a realistic argument. Now let’s actually look at it from the talent community, the greatest showrunners in the world. David Benioff is not going to take the next Game of Thrones to basically TikTok or to Instagram. They’re going to take it to Netflix. They’re going to take it to Amazon. They’re going to take it to Apple, they’re going to take it to HBO Max. They’re going to take it to Paramount Plus. That’s not actually how the ecosystem works. If this deal is allowed to come to pass, it is anti-competitive, and it is a horrible deal for Hollywood. And as someone who spent the last 15 years of my life producing movies and television shows, this is an industry that I love, this is an existential moment for our business, and we believe that what we are offering is better for Hollywood. It’s better for the customers and it’s pro-competitive.""""And when you look at the consolidation of market share that would occur by combining Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix, that is unprecedented market share. And so from that standpoint, we think that, that is deeply anticompetitive,"" he added. Talking numbers, Paramount CEO said, ""We are trying to combine the number four streamer with the number five streamer. When you put Paramount and HBO Max together, you get round numbers, 200 million subscribers. That creates a streaming service that is competitive with Disney. When you put number one and number three together, you are handing Netflix unprecedented market power, which is anti-competitive in every single measure, every single metric you can measure. And we think that is bad. Again, it’s bad for the consumer. It’s bad for the creative community. This deal, if it is allowed to move forward, will actually be the death of the theatrical movie business in Hollywood. We’re sitting here today trying to save it.""According to a report by Reuters, antitrust experts doubt regulators will buy Netflix argument. While Netflix insists the deal is needed to challenge Google's YouTube, which media analysis firm Nielsen ranks as America's most-watched TV distributor. However, attorneys quoted in the report say that the Justice Department is unlikely to see Netflix and YouTube as interchangeable rivals, given their different content, audiences and business models. ""Netflix is trying to say it competes with YouTube because people only watch a certain amount of content a day,"" said Abiel Garcia, antitrust partner at Kesselman Brantly Stockinger. ""That argument ultimately fails.""The DOJ is not likely to view those videos as a substitute for Netflix shows and movies, experts said. While companies often seek to defend their mergers by pointing to competition from a broad universe of established and emerging players, antitrust enforcers are experienced in finding the ways that mergers quash competition in distinct sub-markets.","Netflix says it must acquire Warner Bros Discovery to compete with YouTube.

We know exactly what requires a license and what doesn’t. And companies know who they’re selling to. But instead, they rely on a checkbox that says, ‘I’m not shipping to Putin.’ That’s it. No enforcement. No accountability.”

What are causes of action alleged in the complaint filed by Ukranians





Some Ukrainians seem very angry with American chip giants Texas Instruments (TI), AMD and Intel. Dozens of Ukrainian civilians have reportedly filed a series of lawsuits in Texas this week, accusing some of the biggest US chip companies of negligently failing to track chips that evaded export curbs. According to a report in Ars Technics, those chips were ultimately used to power Russian and Iranian weapon systems, causing wrongful deaths.According to the report, their complaints alleged that for years, Texas Instruments (TI), AMD, and Intel have ignored public reporting, government warnings, and shareholder pressure to do more to track final destinations of chips and shut down shady distribution channels diverting chips to sanctioned actors in Russia and Iran.The lawsuit claims that these American chipmakers failed to prevent their products from reaching hostile regimes. “There are export lists. All that intermediaries who placed bulk online orders had to do to satisfy chip companies was check a box confirming that the shipment wouldn’t be sent to sanctioned countries,"" lead attorney Mikal Watts told reporters at a press conference, as reported by Kyiv Independent.The claims in this case arise under Texas tort law, which imposes a duty on companies to act with reasonable care and to prevent foreseeable harm. The factual record includes extensive evidence that the defendants also violated US export control laws designed to stop exactly this kind of diversion. The complaint lays out a consistent pattern of misconduct. Defendants sold into regions already identified as high risk. They continued doing business with distributors who had been publicly linked to sanctioned actors. The indicators of diversion were clear. They proceeded anyway.The complaint has four causes of action. The first is a negligence claim. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants had a duty under Texas law to exercise reasonable care in how they designed, implemented, and enforced compliance and export control systems. The complaint states that the companies breached that duty in several ways. They failed to conduct adequate due diligence on high-risk customers and distributors. They failed to respond to repeated government advisories and public reports showing that their products were being diverted. They allowed sales to continue into known high-risk transshipment hubs without strengthening controls. They kept working with intermediaries that had been linked to diversion activity. They failed to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable misuse of their microchips in weapons systems used against civilians. They also continued selling microprocessors and related technology, directly or indirectly, into channels that supplied China, Russia, and Iran, which ultimately armed the military drones used against Ukrainian civilians.The complaint then alleges negligence per se. Plaintiffs assert that the defendants violated U.S. export control laws, sanctions regulations, and Executive Orders entered by Presidents Obama, Trump, and Biden that bar the diversion of sensitive microelectronics to hostile actors. These laws exist to prevent U.S. technology from reaching foreign weapons programs and to protect civilians from the harm that follows when those safeguards are ignored. Because the defendants violated these rules, the complaint treats their conduct as automatically negligent and a proximate cause of the injuries at issue.Plaintiffs also bring a claim for gross negligence. They allege that the companies had actual knowledge of an extreme degree of risk. The harm was predictable. Public reporting showed their chips repeatedly appearing in Russian and Iranian weapons systems. Congressional testimony, industry analysis, and government warnings made the threat plain. Despite this information, the defendants allegedly failed to adopt effective compliance measures and continued their existing sales practices with full awareness of the potential consequences.The complaint next sets out wrongful death claims. Families who lost loved ones in drone and missile attacks allege that defendants’ negligent and grossly negligent conduct was a direct and proximate cause of those deaths. These plaintiffs seek damages for the loss of companionship, mental anguish, and other harms recognized under the Texas Wrongful Death statute.Finally, the complaint includes survival claims. Plaintiffs assert that the decedents suffered physical pain, mental anguish, property loss, and medical expenses before death. Their estates seek recovery for those losses, as well as funeral expenses. Because the complaint alleges that the defendants acted with gross negligence, both the wrongful death and survival claims seek exemplary damages as permitted by Texas law. Exemplary damages are a category of damages intended to punish especially wrongful conduct and to deter similar conduct in the future.","Ukrainian civilians have reportedly filed a series of lawsuits in Texas this week, accusing some of the biggest US chip companies of negligently failing to track chips that evaded export curbs.

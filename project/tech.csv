Part of geopolitical and tech package

Saudi Arabia backed Elon Musk's Twitter purchase





Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has secured a significant international partnership, agreeing to collaborate with the state-backed Saudi company Humain to construct a sprawling new data center in the oil-rich kingdom, according to sources familiar with the negotiations, as quoted by The New York Times. The deal reportedly aligns the intersecting ambitions of Elon Musk, who has been aggressively seeking partners to accelerate xAI’s growth in the competitive AI race against rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is attempting to transform Saudi Arabia into a global technology and artificial intelligence hub.The joint project is poised to become xAI's largest data center outside the United States, designed to consume an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity. While the specific financial terms were not disclosed by Humain and xAI, the sheer scale underscores the commitment of both parties.Tareq Amin, the CEO of Humain, emphasized the scale of the endeavor, saying the deal was ""creating scale that few others can match."" The report noted that the deal had been under negotiation for months but faced delays due in part to uncertainty over Saudi Arabia’s access to specialized U.S.semiconductors. Although President Donald Trump had announced a deal in May to supply thousands of Nvidia AI chips to the kingdom, the delivery had been held up amid U.S. concerns about Riyadh’s economic and technological ties to China.The announcement was part of a broader package of military and technology agreements unveiled during Crown Prince Mohammed's visit to Washington. Crucially, the United States and Saudi Arabia appear to have reached an understanding that will pave the way for the kingdom to acquire the vital U.S. semiconductors needed to power advanced artificial intelligence, a move that highlights the use of AI chips as a tool of geopolitical diplomacy by the U.S.For Humain, an AI company established by the Crown Prince in May with support from the country’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund—the collaboration with xAI, which makes the Grok chatbot, represents a major win. The kingdom’s strategy, executed through Humain, aims to leverage its considerable assets—ample energy reserves, deep pockets, vast land availability, and links to global fiber optic networks—to become a key exporter of cheap AI computing power. Humain has set an ambitious target to power 6% of the global AI workload in the coming years.The agreement further expands Elon Musk's business footprint in Saudi Arabia, which also provided financial backing for his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in 2022. The kingdom also backed his $44 billion purchase of Twitter in 2022, before he renamed it X. Elon Musk had pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. Banks, including Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America, committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing. Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corpco-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal."," xAI agrees to collaborate with state-backed Saudi company Humain to construct a sprawling new data center in the oil-rich kingdom.

Canada and Sweden partner to grow trade ties





Canada has announced a massive, tenfold increase in its commitment to the European Space Agency (ESA) programs, pledging CA$528.5 million (approximately $376 million USD). The significant investment, confirmed by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), signals a strategic push to diversify Canada's economy and strengthen ties with European partners amid global trade uncertainties and a focus on national defence. The investment is reported to be expected to be spread over a period of three to five years, with final allocation decisions to be made at the upcoming ESA Ministerial Council meeting on November 26–27.The announcement comes as the as the North American nation looks to reduce its dependence on the US for military equipment and as an export market. The significant jump in funding comes as Canada seeks to reduce its reliance on its southern neighbour, facing economic pressure from U.S. tariffs and the unpredictable nature of U.S. politics. While Canada is a long-standing ""Cooperating State"" with the ESA since 1979, this contribution dramatically increases its financial presence in the international body.Industry Minister Mélanie Joly underscored the domestic benefits of the commitment. ""This historic investment to European Space Agency programs creates new opportunities for Canada's world-renowned space sector to thrive globally, advance technologies and build a competitive and resilient industrial base that serves our national interests,"" she stated.The Canadian Space Agency highlights the high return on investment from this partnership, noting that every dollar awarded to Canadian businesses through ESA contracts generates more than three dollars in follow-on sales.Canada and Sweden recently announced a strategic partnership to deepen cooperation on defense and trade, as the country looks to reduce its dependence on the US for military equipment and as an export market. The agreement pledges to increase cooperation in five main areas: economic development, security, the Arctic, science and technology, and the environment.“We are like-minded Arctic nations with shared interests in the North Atlantic and the Arctic region,” the countries said in a joint statement.The partnership comes as Sweden’s Saab AB is in talks with Quebec-based Bombardier about building its Gripen fighter jets in Canada.

Charlie Kirk's killing was the turning point

Saudi Arabia backs Elon Musk’s xAI with mult-billion deal





It seems to be 'Bro time' again for Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Tesla CEO Elon Musk made first public appearance at White House, signaling a potential thawing of tensions. The world's richest man, Elon Musk, was seen attending a high-profile dinner at the White House on November 18, joining Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and some select top US business leaders. The dinner, hosted by President Donald Trump, comes months after a very public feud between the President and the billionaire CEO.""We have the biggest business leaders in the world,"" President Trump told attendees at the event. Incidentally, Elon Musk was not the only influential executive at the Tuesday night dinner at White House. The guest list featured other titans of industry, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, highlighting the Trump administration's engagement with leading executives of technology and global businesses.Elon Musk's attendance marks his first public visit to the White House since his acrimonious departure in June from his role as the de facto leader of the White House DOGE Office.That departure ignited a fiery public feud with the President, which played out as Congress debated the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" the cornerstone of Trump's domestic agenda.The rift centered on the massive fiscal package. Musk publicly criticized the bill's impact on the national debt, while the President and Republican allies countered that the CEO's true concern was the legislation's provision to phase out electric vehicle incentives. The bill ultimately passed in July.The first signs of a rapprochement have been visible since September end. The two men briefly spoke face-to-face at the memorial service for conservative figure Charlie Kirk in September. More recently, in October, President Trump commented on their improving ties. ""I like Elon,"" Trump told reporters at the time, describing their relationship as ""good."" He added, ""I've always liked him."" The President also noted that he had spoken with Elon Musk ""on and off, a little bit"" since the memorial service.Elon Musk’s xAI, which makes the chatbot Grok, agreed to work with the state-backed Saudi company Humain to build a new data center.

Adobe to acquire Semrush for $1.9 billion in major AI-and-SEO expansion push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/adobe-to-acquire-semrush-for-1-9-billion-in-major-ai-and-seo-expansion-push/articleshow/125445293.cms,"Adobe strengthens its AI-powered marketing ecosystem

Why Adobe wants Semrush now





Adobe has announced plans to acquire Semrush, one of the world’s leading brand visibility and SEO intelligence platforms, in an all-cash deal valued at approximately $1.9 billion. The acquisition, approved by both companies’ boards, will see Adobe pay $12 per share — a nearly 77.5% premium over Semrush’s market price prior to the announcement. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval and Semrush shareholder consent.The acquisition marks one of Adobe’s most significant steps yet in expanding its AI-driven marketing cloud. By integrating Semrush into Adobe Experience Cloud, the company aims to merge traditional SEO, brand visibility analytics and emerging generative AI discovery — including how brands appear in large language model (LLM) outputs.Semrush’s suite of tools — spanning keyword research, site auditing, competitive analysis, content insights and brand-mention tracking across AI platforms — will enhance Adobe’s ability to offer unified customer experience orchestration across owned channels, classic search engines and AI-powered interfaces.Within Adobe’s ecosystem, Semrush’s Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) capabilities are expected to play a major role, enabling brands to optimise visibility not only for search engines but also for AI chatbots, recommendation engines and generative systems that increasingly shape how consumers find information.The acquisition reflects a broader shift in digital marketing. As consumers rely more on AI-generated answers than traditional search, brands face a new challenge: staying visible in a world where LLMs summarise the web and filter commercial visibility. Adobe is positioning itself as the platform that helps businesses adapt to this transition.Semrush has experienced strong enterprise growth in recent years, serving major global clients such as Amazon, TikTok, and JPMorgan Chase. Its data-rich SEO and competitive intelligence tools will give Adobe deeper insight into customer journeys, search behaviour and online brand perception — insights that become even more critical as AI reshapes the marketing landscape.Once the deal closes, Adobe plans to tightly integrate Semrush’s workflows into its analytics and content optimisation products. This will give marketers a streamlined system where SEO insights, content creation, customer data and campaign performance live under one roof — all enhanced by Adobe’s expanding AI stack.","Adobe has announced plans to acquire Semrush, one of the world’s leading brand visibility and SEO intelligence platforms.

Why Gates Foundation's latest 13F filing left analysts asking 'But WHY',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-gates-foundations-latest-13f-filing-left-analysts-asking-but-why/articleshow/125444983.cms,"Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Bill Gates calls to UN to ‘pivot’ from climate action to vaccines and poverty





Gates Foundation Trust executed one of its most dramatic portfolio shifts in recent history during the third quarter of 2025. The portfolio change was revealed in Gates Foundation's latest 13F filing that left analysts wondering the reason behind the big move. The company drastically reduced its stake in Microsoft, the company that Bill Gates founded and the one in which he still holds good number of shares. Gates Foundation also cut stake in some other major Bluechip holdings, according to its latest 13F filing with the SEC. The quarter was defined by heavy divestment, resulting in the trust's total portfolio value falling sharply from $47.78 billion at the end of Q2 to $36.58 billion as of September 30. The quarter was strictly a period of selling, as the foundation made no new purchases and did not increase any existing stakes. These moves reduced the total number of unique holdings in the portfolio from 25 to 23.The most significant action was the sale of 17 million shares of Microsoft. This move represented a massive 65% reduction in the trust's position, cutting the holding from over 26.19 million shares to just 9.19 million.The divestment, which reaped $8.267 billion, is widely viewed by analysts as a strategic effort to rebalance a highly concentrated portfolio and generate liquidity for the foundation's increasing philanthropic commitments.The move to reduce the anchor Microsoft position is seen as aligning with the trust's long-standing goal of avoiding single-stock concentration and funding the foundation's plan to significantly increase its annual charitable spending.In addition to the dramatic Microsoft cut, the foundation trimmed several other top-tier investments. The substantial rebalancing changed the hierarchy of the trust's major holdings, with Berkshire Hathaway, Waste Management, and Canadian National Railway emerging as the new top three. The value of the remaining CNR stake is now marginally higher than the reduced MSFT position.Bill Gates recently called for the United Nations to make a “major strategic pivot” from a “doomsday view” of climate goals towards funding vaccines and alleviating poverty. The Microsoft founder defended the trade-off between tackling the long term rise in the global temperature versus the nearer term fatal consequences of the distribution of medicines in poor countries. It said that it was a pragmatic stance following dramatic cuts in aid by wealthy countries, led by America.","Gates Foundation Trust executed one of its most dramatic portfolio shifts in recent history during the third quarter of 2025.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Explained: The allegations that forced Larry Summers off the OpenAI board,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-the-allegations-that-forced-larry-summers-off-the-openai-board/articleshow/125441602.cms,"So what exactly is he accused of? And why has it blown up now?



The allegations

Extensive email exchanges with Epstein

Seeking personal advice from Epstein







A political backlash across party lines

Part of the widening Epstein fallout

What Summers says

Why this matters





For years, Larry Summers occupied rarefied air in American public life. Former US Treasury secretary. Ex-Harvard president. A fixture in Democratic economic policymaking. And more recently, one of the most recognisable names on the OpenAI board. This week, that run ended abruptly. Summers stepped down after newly disclosed documents revived uncomfortable questions about the depth of his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein , the disgraced financier whose network continues to ensnare powerful figures years after his death.Summers has insisted he is stepping back from “public commitments”, but the political pressure was unmistakable. The release of previously unseen email correspondence set off bipartisan calls for institutions to cut ties with him. For OpenAI, already under intense public scrutiny, the reputational calculation was clear.The controversy centres on a tranche of emails released by a House panel investigating Epstein’s network. These messages show Summers corresponding with Epstein over several years. The quantity and familiarity of the exchanges have raised fresh questions about whether Summers’ ties to Epstein were deeper than he previously acknowledged.One of the most striking revelations is an email in which Summers appears to seek Epstein’s guidance about a personal relationship with a woman.That detail has triggered particular concern because it implies a personal, not merely professional, dependence on Epstein’s counsel.Both Democrats and Republicans reacted swiftly, urging universities, businesses, and public institutions to sever connections with Summers. In Washington, that level of bipartisan pressure often signals a problem that is no longer containable. While the emails do not allege criminal conduct by Summers, the political consensus was that his continued presence on prominent boards was untenable.Summers’ resignation is the latest in a series of public reckonings prompted by long-delayed disclosures from Epstein’s records. As more documents emerge, the reputational risk for anyone tied to Epstein — even tangentially — continues to grow. For Summers, who has spent decades as a public commentator and policy adviser, the cost is not merely symbolic. It is a direct hit to his influence in the tech and policy world.Summers has avoided commenting on the contents of the emails themselves. Instead, he framed his decision as part of a broader move to step back from public roles. He expressed gratitude for his time on the OpenAI board and indicated he would continue to follow the company’s progress. The lack of a substantive response, however, has not eased the political scrutiny.Summers has long been one of the central figures in American economic debate — a voice that presidents listened to, institutions courted, and markets paid attention to. His departure from OpenAI is significant not only because of his stature, but because of the company involved. OpenAI is under unprecedented public scrutiny, and any board-level controversy risks undermining trust in the company’s governance.The episode also highlights a broader shift: Epstein-related disclosures remain potent enough to reshape careers years later. Even without accusations of criminal wrongdoing, associative reputational damage has become a powerful force. For Summers, the fallout may mark the most serious challenge to his public standing since his contentious exit from Harvard nearly two decades ago.This is not the last Epstein-related tremor the US establishment will face. But for one of America’s most influential economic thinkers, it is already seismic.",Summers stepped down after newly disclosed documents revived uncomfortable questions about the depth of his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. He has insisted he is stepping back from ‘public commitments’ but the political pressure was unmistakable.

What methods Meta will use to verify ages







Meta has announced it will restrict Australian teenagers under 16 from accessing Instagram, Facebook and Threads by December 10, making it the first major tech company to implement Australia’s social media ban for minors.The tech giant has already begun notifying users believed to be between 13 and 15 years old through in-app messages, emails, and text alerts that their accounts will be deactivated, news agency Reuters reported. Starting December 4, Meta will begin shutting down existing accounts and preventing new sign-ups from anyone under 16. The company expects to complete the entire process by December 10, when the law officially takes effect.According to Australia's internet regulator, approximately 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 Instagram users aged 13 to 15 will lose access to these platforms. Data for Threads users in this age group has not been published.Meta stated it will employ multiple age assurance techniques while adopting a “data minimisation approach.” The company will only request additional verification information when it has legitimate reasons to question a user's stated age.Antigone Davis, Meta's vice president and global head of safety, emphasised that “compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process.”Impacted users can update their contact information to receive notifications when they turn 16, download their personal data before accounts are deactivated, or choose to permanently delete their accounts.Australia’s social media ban is said to be one of the world's most comprehensive governmental efforts to regulate minors' access to social platforms. The legislation places responsibility on social media companies to take “reasonable steps” to prevent underage access, with potential penalties reaching A$49.5 million ($32.09 million) for violations.","Australian teenagers under 16 will be banned from accessing Instagram, Facebook and Threads by December 10.

Easing rules for AI training







The European Commission has said that it will streamline and ease several key technology regulations, including delaying major provisions of its landmark AI Act, in a move which can be seen as a victory for tech giants like Google, Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta and OpenAI. The effort, dubbed a ‘Digital Omnibus,’ aims to cut red tape and boost Europe's competitiveness following intense criticism against the continent’s stringent regulatory landscape.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the most significant proposal involves delaying the enforcement of the strictest rules on “high risk” uses of AI from August 2026 to December 2027.The report said that this grace period offers tech companies more time to comply with regulations governing AI applications in critical areas, including biometric identification, job applications and exams, health services, law enforcement and creditworthiness assessments.“Simplification is not deregulation. Simplification means that we are taking a critical look at our regulatory landscape,” a Commission official stated, defending the decision despite concerns about weakening consumer protections.The package also proposes changes affecting core privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These amendments will allow major technology companies to potentially use Europeans’ personal data to train their AI models, a key need for companies like Google and OpenAI as they develop sophisticated generative AI systems.Furthermore, the Commission proposed simplifying the process for obtaining consent for pop-up “cookies,” addressing a frequent complaint from both users and businesses.The package covers a wide range of legislation, including the AI Act, GDPR, the e-Privacy Directive, and the Data Act. The proposals will now proceed to debate and require votes from European member countries before becoming law.","The European Commission has said that it will streamline and ease several key technology regulations, including delaying major provisions of its landmark AI Act.

Indian travelers are displaying confidence and a massive appetite for travel, with 68% relying on YouTube videos as their primary source of inspiration, according to the new Google-commissioned Kantar report, ‘Travel Rewired: Decoding The Indian Traveler. ’ The report, which surveyed consumers across Metros, Tier 1, and Tier 2 cities, found that 88% of Indians are keen to travel.According to the report, a trend shows that cost is less of a concern than maximising value and comfort. Domestically, 72% of travelers are less concerned about cost and 81% expect to splurge. This premium spending is evident in international travel, where the average expenditure is 3.2 times that of a domestic trip.The report says digital platforms are essential across the entire journey with YouTube dominating the discovery phase, with its creators highly influential and trusted by 59% of travelers during planning. Even short-form videos (Shorts) are used for inspiration by two in five travelers.When it comes to booking preference, 85% of travelers prefer to book online, with brand trust serving as the top deciding factor for choosing airlines and accommodation.Both Google Search and YouTube play critical roles during the research phase, guiding travelers on key activities (51% use Search) and accommodations (46% use Search).The study identified four distinct traveler profiles, all unified by their high reliance on digital content creators:These travelers, who pursue niche experiences like gig-tripping, show the highest use of inspiration touchpoints, with 71% citing YouTube as their top source.A high-value segment focused on luxury and convenience; 88% use YouTube for creator-led information during their meticulous, week-plus long planning phase.Predominantly younger individuals who are first-time planners or payers.

"Microsoft Ignite 2025: Microsoft 365 Copilot gets AI agents for Word, Excel and PowerPoint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ignite-2025-microsoft-365-copilot-gets-word-excel-and-powerpoint-agents/articleshow/125438656.cms,"How Microsoft designed these agents







At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Microsoft announced the introduction of dedicated Word, Excel, and PowerPoint agents within Microsoft 365 Copilot. These new agents will allow users to create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations directly in Copilot Chat. The agents use advanced reasoning models to produce structured, high-quality output for productivity tasks. This integration will allow users to start projects in Copilot Chat using natural-language prompts to generate initial drafts quickly. The agents are designed to guide the user by asking clarifying questions, helping to shape the output to match specific goals and uses, whether the task is drafting a strategic plan, analysing data, or building a presentation.Once the initial draft is ready, users can easily move into the specific apps like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint for further editing and customisation. Within these apps, Copilot will continue to assist with refining content and applying formatting.A new feature called Agent Mode will extend Copilot's capabilities within each app, enabling direct edits and changes with powerful, application-specific tools, thereby enhancing interactivity and action.Notably, Agent Mode for PowerPoint is new to the Frontier program, which adds enhanced creation and editing capabilities to presentations.Microsoft explains that its goal was to bring the idea of coding agents from software engineering into Office. The company wants Office agents to handle long, complex tasks for users and to create high-quality Word documents, Excel sheets, and PowerPoint decks.To do this, they built an “agentic harness,” a system that helps agents plan and complete tasks using AI models. These agents use the same Word, Excel, and PowerPoint skills available in Agent Mode, but now inside Copilot Chat.The agents can plan, check, and refine their work in multiple steps, which helps them produce steady and reliable results. With Microsoft’s Office architecture and enterprise systems, this becomes an essential step toward AI-supported content creation.Early testing shows that the output quality is similar to that of other agent systems, and the team expects further improvements over time.The agentic harness uses a skills-based design that lets Office agents plan and work together in a modular way. A key challenge was building a secure environment in which agents could run independently while maintaining safe access to Microsoft 365 services.The company created a protected sandbox with controlled access to resources. Complex agents remain difficult to build, so Microsoft added harness hooks and sub-agents to maintain control and reliability. Each agent runs in a locked-down container with no direct internet access, using secure APIs and a brokered WebSocket for communication.Instead of creating Office files directly, the agent first produces an intermediate format that later becomes a full Office document. This helps protect user data and ensures accuracy. Office apps generate the final files, which preserve formatting, themes, formulas, and security features such as sensitivity labels.The system also uses Work IQ to bring in approved enterprise context from Microsoft Graph, such as notes or emails, only with the user’s permissions. Files are stored safely in OneDrive, where Microsoft’s policies and protections keep them safe.The agents also use multi-step reasoning, similar to how a human consultant works. This includes planning, researching, drafting and reviewing. They run checks during the process to confirm calculations and improve drafts. This leads to more accurate and consistent results.The company even reused many elements from Office’s existing Agent Mode, helping ensure consistency and speeding up development as Office continues to evolve.Apart from this, Microsoft says that Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot are only the early steps. As more organisations join the Frontier program, the company plans to add new features, improve the overall experience, and respond to user feedback.Upcoming updates may include better use of enterprise data in Excel, smoother switching between chat and the apps, and new ways to work and create together.These agents are designed to support users as they write documents, study data, or build presentations, helping them move from an idea to a final result with less effort.Microsoft says more updates are on the way as Copilot continues to grow as an AI partner in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.","Microsoft has introduced Word, Excel, and PowerPoint agents in Copilot Chat.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has reiterated his stance on achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) – a hypothetical type of AI with human-level intelligence. Despite claiming “the fastest progress” in the industry with the company’s Gemini 3.0 models, Hassabis stated that true AGI remains 5 to 10 years away and will require one or two additional major breakthroughs. He previously said that there's a 50% chance of achieving AGI by 2030.While talking in an interview, Hassabis expressed satisfaction with the development of Gemini 3, which he expects will “pleasantly surprise” the public, noting that the model is “dead on track” with the rapid trajectory DeepMind has maintained since the beginning of the Gemini project.“But on top of that.

Microsoft Ignite 2025: Microsoft introduces Agent 365 to help companies manage AI agent usage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ignite-2025-microsoft-introduces-agent-365-to-help-companies-manage-ai-agent-usage/articleshow/125437224.cms,"Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode

“Agent 365 delivers unified observability across your entire agent fleet through telemetry, dashboards, and alerts. IT leaders can track every agent being used, built, or brought into the organisation, eliminating blind spots and reducing risk.”

How Microsoft’s Agent 365 will help companies







At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Microsoft announced Agent 365, a new platform designed to help companies manage and govern the increasing deployment and usage of AI agents. As AI agents are already automating tasks and accelerating productivity across industries, the anticipated multiplication and sophistication of these agents pose a challenge for businesses to manage and govern them responsibly and at scale. The software giant suggests the practical approach to this new challenge is to manage agents using infrastructure, apps and protections similar to those currently used to manage employees and power business operations. Agent 365 will serve as a control plane for AI agents, enabling organisations to deploy, organise, and govern their agents securely.Agent 365 is intended to support the management of agents regardless of their origin, covering those created with Microsoft platforms, open-source frameworks, or third-party platforms. This new platform is presented as the next evolution of existing enterprise systems that are already in place within organisations. As per IDC’s predictions, there will be 1.3 billion agents by 2028, the company noted.In a blog post, the company wrote:Microsoft Agent 365 introduces a structured framework for managing and scaling AI agents across enterprises, built around five core capabilities: Registry, Access Control, Visualization, Interoperability, and Security. Together, these components help organisations move from small, isolated agent experiments to governed, production-ready deployments.The Registry serves as a central inventory of all agents within an organisation, including usage and security information. Through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and Microsoft Entra registry, IT teams can track agents with Entra IDs, those registered in the Teams Store, and soon, shadow agents. IT admins can also quarantine unsanctioned agents to prevent users or company systems from accessing them. The registry supports IT, developers, security, and business teams, while the Agent Store enables employees to find agents suited to their workflows.Access control ensures each agent is assigned a unique ID, enabling permissions to be managed effectively. IT teams can define who creates, onboards, and oversees agents. With Agent Policy Templates and Microsoft Entra, organisations can enforce standard policies, apply adaptive risk-based access rules, and restrict agents to least-privilege access, reducing misuse or accidental data exposure.Visualization tools provide unified dashboards that map agent connections across users and resources. They support role-based reporting, performance tracking, and compliance features such as logs, reports, e-discovery, and behaviour monitoring, helping teams evaluate agent effectiveness and maintain oversight.Interoperability allows agents to access the same apps and data users rely on—including Word, Excel, SharePoint, and Dynamics 365—through Work IQ, which provides organisational context. Agent 365 supports development across Microsoft platforms, open-source frameworks, and partner clouds via Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, the Agent Framework, and the Agent 365 SDK.Security features include vulnerability management, AI-driven threat detection, data protection, and real-time blocking of compromised agents through Microsoft Defender, Entra, and Purview.Agent 365 is part of a growing ecosystem that includes Microsoft-built agents, partner integrations, and open-source models. Accessible through the Microsoft 365 admin centre, it offers IT and security teams a unified control environment for deploying and managing AI agents responsibly and efficiently.","Microsoft announced Agent 365, a new platform designed to help companies manage and govern the increasing deployment and usage of AI agents.

Core disputes in Nexperia fight remain unresolved







The dispute over chipmaker Nexperia that has unsettled the global automotive industry appears to be easing, as the Dutch government announced on Wednesday (November 19) that it is suspending its intervention in the company. The decision follows what the Netherlands described as constructive talks with China regarding the supply shortages that have hampered car manufacturers across Europe.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans confirmed the move in a statement, calling it a “gesture of goodwill.”“We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,” he noted, indicating that dialogue will continue.The intervention is a welcome sign for automakers, who rely heavily on Nexperia for essential basic computer chips. The ongoing crisis had threatened supply chains, forcing production slowdowns and halts.Major players like BMW, Bosch and Aumovio welcomed the development but cautioned that it is “too early to judge what impact it will have.” European Union Trade Chief Maros Sefcovic also praised the move, anticipating it would help stabilise supply chains.While the state-level tension is cooling, the fundamental conflict within Nexperia remains. The dispute stemmed from the Dutch government taking control of Nexperia on September 30 to prevent the former CEO from moving operations to China. In retaliation, Beijing had temporarily halted exports of Nexperia's finished products.The stalemate between Nexperia's European headquarters and its Chinese parent, Wingtech, continues. Most of Nexperia’s wafers are manufactured in Hamburg, Germany, then shipped to Dongguan, China, for final packaging.Following the Dutch intervention, the Chinese arm declared itself independent of European management. Citing non-payment, the European side responded by stopping wafer shipments to China on October 26, further threatening supplies.","Dutch government suspends intervention in chipmaker Nexperia.

Republican push faces bipartisan resistance from state protections

Innovation concerns fuel debate over regulatory control





US President Donald Trump issued an urgent call for Congress to establish a single federal standard for artificial intelligence regulation, warning that a patchwork of state-level rules threatens America's lead over China in the global AI competition.Trump posted on Truth Social that overregulation by individual states is undermining AI-driven economic growth, declaring that ""If we don't, then China will easily catch us in the AI race.""The president urged lawmakers to include the AI measure in the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act or pass it as a separate bill, advocating for ""one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.""Trump's intervention comes as House Majority Leader Steve Scalise explores reviving a controversial moratorium on state AI laws—an effort that crashed spectacularly this summer when 99 senators rejected it during budget negotiations.The proposal faces fierce resistance across party lines. Republican Senators Marsha Blackburn and Josh Hawley have championed state-led initiatives protecting children from AI threats, while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis publicly opposed the latest federal overreach attempt.Both conservative and liberal states have already enacted AI regulations that would be swept away by federal preemption. California mandates security protocol disclosures from major AI developers, while other states have pursued varied approaches addressing everything from copyright protections to child safety measures.Silicon Valley giants and trade groups like NetChoice argue that navigating 50 different regulatory regimes stifles innovation and surrenders ground to China's streamlined approach. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly warned that Beijing's unified regulatory framework gives Chinese AI companies a decisive strategic advantage.Yet critics fear overly broad federal language could inadvertently block crucial protections, including children's online safety laws and copyright controls.

‘Heavy reliance on Cloudflare caused losses’



Cloudflare says a bug caused service disruption







Cloudflare outage on November 18 not only disrupted hundreds of tech websites but also finance sector that rely on the IT company’s services, a report has said, noting that the three-hour disruption potentially cost forex and Contracts for Difference (CFD) brokers an estimated $1.58 billion in lost trading volume. The unavailability of services left the websites of many brokers displaying the “Internal server error” message, effectively pausing trading operations.According to a report by Cyprus-based financial publication Finance Magnates, the loss translates to roughly 1% of their typical monthly trading revenue. It said that firms including Monaxa, Skilling, Xtrade, and FXPro were among those confirmed to be impacted.The report says that the heavy dependence of brokers on Cloudflare caused billions in losses. Financial firms utilise the service not only as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) but crucially for protection against cyberattacks, making it an almost non-optional tool for platforms lacking vast internal security teams.Citing market data compiled by Finance Magnates Intelligence, the publication claims that the three peak hours of the outage typically account for approximately 20% of the daily trading volume handled by these brokers.While explaining how they reached the $1.58 billion figure, it said that volume loss was calculated by analysing the trading activity of all but the top ten CFD brokers, who are presumed not to rely on Cloudflare.The average monthly trading volume for this group in Q3 2025 was estimated at $174 billion. This translates to an average daily volume of $7.91 billion (based on 22 trading days). Considering the three-hour outage hit during peak activity, the calculated average loss per affected broker stands at $1.58 billion in trading volume.While the smallest affected brokers may have lost around $364 million, the larger ones could have seen losses exceeding $3 billion. The estimated figure of $1.58 billion represents a loss of 0.91% of their monthly trading volume, which correlates directly to a roughly 1% loss in monthly trading revenue.A global outage at internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare – which brought down hundreds of websites, including major platforms like ChatGPT, Twitter, Perplexity and Claude – was caused by what the San Francisco-based company described as a “spike in unusual traffic” triggered by a latent bug.Cloudflare also confirmed the incident was not the result of malicious activity.“The cause of the outage was a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic,” said spokesperson Jackie Dutton.“The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare's services,” Dutton added.In addition to the major AI and social media platforms, other online services such as Uber, Canva, Spotify, Grindr, NJ Transit, and League of Legends also experienced connectivity issues. Even the outage-tracking site DownDetector was affected for a short duration of time.

How Xpeng’s Iron robot will be different from Tesla’s Optimus

“hardest year”





Chinese EV startup Xpeng is positioning its humanoid robot, Iron, as a direct competitor to Tesla's Optimus. The company is emphasising traits that promote physical interaction, such as hugging humans, as it plans to take on the Optimus humanoid robot being developed by the Elon Musk–led EV maker. Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng recently unveiled the latest version of Iron, stating the company's goal is for its bipedal bots to beDuring a recent earnings call, Xiaopeng informed analysts that incorporating features like fake muscles andinto Iron made individuals feel more comfortable touching and even hugging the robot. This emphasis on tactile and emotional comfort represents a key strategy for Xpeng to gain an edge in the rapidly evolving humanoid robot market.By prioritising thisXpeng is differentiating Iron from competitors like Tesla's Optimus. This focus suggests a belief that user acceptance and comfort with physical interaction could be a significant factor in the successful deployment and adoption of humanoid robots.Xiaopeng noted.Unlike other humanoid robots, Iron features a clearly human-like build, with Xpeng presenting both male and female versions. The company said users will be able to customise the robot with different body types. During a demo at the unveiling, Xpeng employees even cut into the robot’s flexibleto show that no person was inside.On the other hand, in 2021, at Tesla's AI Day, the company first presented a human wearing a robot suit, and in a later 2024 event, several Optimus units were operated remotely rather than functioning autonomously. The initial showcase clearly involved a person in a costume, while the later use of remote control for actual robots raised questions about how mature the technology is.Speaking to analysts, Xiaopeng said Xpeng aims to sell 1 million Iron robots annually by 2030, with mass production planned for the end of 2026. The Xpeng CEO, who believes the market for humanoid robots may eventually exceed the size of the car market, added that he expects early uses to include retail and tour-guide roles.Xpeng also plans to deploy Iron in its stores next year, he said. This production push suggests that one of Tesla’s strongest robotics competitors may emerge from China.Meanwhile, Tesla is preparing to begin mass production of its own humanoid robot, Optimus, by late 2026. The company’s CEO, Elon Musk , has said Optimus could become Tesla’s biggest product, and the company’s AI chief told employees that 2026 will be theof their lives.Founded in 2014, Xpeng has grown into a prominent startup competing with Tesla in China’s EV market. The Guangzhou-based company has broken sales records this year and is approaching profitability. Xpeng executives also said that the company will introduce seven new vehicles next year, including three robotaxi models, and expects to begin mass production of its $280,000 flying car by 2026.","Chinese EV startup Xpeng is positioning its humanoid robot, Iron, as a direct competitor to Tesla's Optimus.

Suleyman, who co-founded DeepMind, explained that the vision of an ASIdue to the risks of controlling it. He added,Meanwhile, he noted that his team is instead focused on developing awhich will prioritise supporting human interests.

In a September interview, Altman also mentioned that he would be surprised if superintelligence did not emerge by 2030.Moreover, Google DeepMind cofounder Demis Hassabis has suggested a similar timeframe, saying in April that ASI could be reachedhe said.Meanwhile, others remain cautious about ASI.

AI to perform complex work as autonomous agents

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Next Google leader will need an AI companion





Google CEO Sundar Pichai thinks artificial intelligence could eventually take over his job, calling the role of chief executive ""one of the easier things"" for AI to handle. Speaking in a BBC interview that aired this week, Pichai said AI's rapid advancement means even top corporate positions aren't immune to automation. His comments reflect a striking confidence in technology that Google itself is racing to develop, even as questions mount about AI's impact on employment across all levels.Within the next year, Pichai expects AI systems to evolve dramatically. ""I think the next step in the next 12 months, you will see the evolution being that they can do more complex tasks for you,"" he told the BBC. These AI ""agents"" would work independently on users' behalf, marking a significant leap from today's chatbot-style interactions.The CEO didn't sugarcoat the challenges ahead. While AI promises extraordinary benefits and new opportunities, Pichai acknowledged it will bring ""societal disruptions"" requiring adaptation. Some jobs will transform, others will disappear, and society needs an honest conversation about managing this transition, he said. At the Bloomberg event, he acknowledged the legitimacy of concerns about entry-level white-collar job displacement, saying ""it's important to voice those concerns and debate them.His advice to young people? Embrace the change. ""People who learn to adopt and adapt will do better,"" Pichai explained, emphasizing that AI tools will enhance rather than eliminate professions like teaching and medicine.Yet Pichai has consistently maintained that AI will augment rather than replace workers. At Bloomberg's Technology Summit in June, he dismissed concerns that AI could make half of Alphabet's 180,000-person workforce redundant, calling AI ""an accelerator"" that enables engineers to focus on more impactful work. The company plans to continue hiring engineers through 2026, he said.Pichai's thinking on AI leadership isn't new. At Bloomberg's Technology Summit in June 2025, he outlined his vision for Google's next CEO, suggesting the future leader would rely on an ""extraordinary AI companion"" to guide decision-making. He stressed that whoever takes over must ensure Google's innovations genuinely improve people's lives while managing the company's growing influence responsibly.OpenAI's Sam Altman has echoed similar sentiments, telling Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner last month that he would be ""nothing but enthusiastic"" when AI becomes a better CEO than himself. The convergence of views from two of tech's most influential leaders suggests the industry is preparing for a fundamental shift in how companies are run, with AI moving from tool to decision-maker in the executive suite.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai thinks artificial intelligence could eventually take over his job.

UIDAI planning new Aadhaar rule in December that may change how your Aadhar Card looks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uidai-planning-new-aadhaar-rule-in-december-that-may-change-how-your-aadhar-card-looks/articleshow/125432236.cms,"

Why UIDAI wants to remove printed details from Aadhar Cards



New Aadhaar app to support digital verification





The Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is considering a major redesign of Aadhaar cards that would display only the holder's photograph and a QR code, eliminating personal details like name, address, and the 12-digit Aadhaar number, according to PTI. UIDAI CEO Bhuvnesh Kumar announced at an online conference that the authority plans to introduce new rules in December 2025 to prevent data misuse and discourage illegal offline verification practices by hotels, event organizers, and other entities.Kumar explained the rationale behind the proposed change: ""There is a thought process as to why there should be any detail on the card. It should be only a photo and a QR code. If we keep printing, then people will keep accepting what is printed. People who know how to misuse it will keep misusing it."" The move aligns with the Aadhaar Act, which prohibits collecting, using, or storing Aadhaar numbers or biometric data during offline verification. Despite this legal restriction, many organizations continue gathering and retaining photocopies of Aadhaar cards, creating risks of fraud and identity theft.The new card design would store all necessary information securely within the QR code, which can only be accessed through proper authentication channels. ""Aadhaar should never be used as a document. It should only be authenticated with the Aadhaar number or verified using a QR code. Otherwise, it can be a fake document,"" Kumar emphasized.The proposed rule change will be considered by the Aadhaar authority on December 1, 2025. To support this transition, UIDAI is rolling out a new Aadhaar app that will replace the existing mAadhaar application. The updated app will enable QR code-based verification paired with facial recognition technology, allowing users to selectively share information while maintaining privacy. The platform will support various use cases including event entries, hotel check-ins, age verification for purchases, and access to residential complexes, functioning similarly to the DigiYatra system used at airports.","The Unique Identification Authority of India is considering a major redesign of Aadhar cards.

Meta’s AI shake-up



Mira Murati's less-than-one-year-old Thinking Machines to raise new round of funding







In a dramatic turn of events in the ongoing AI talent wars, Soumith Chintala, one of Meta’s most influential AI leaders and co-creator of the widely used PyTorch framework, has joined Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati. This moves comes just months after Murati made headlines for refusing a reported $1 billion job offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg For those unaware, Meta tried to buy OpenAI’s former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati startup, Thinking Machines Lab. But as she declined to sell her company despite a $1 billion offer, Mark Zuckerberg “responded by launching a full-scale raid,” reports the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the report says, approached more than a dozen of Thinking Machines’ 50 employees in the following weeks “to sound them out about jumping ship”. According to the publication, one of his main targets was Andrew Tulloch, a leading researcher and co-founder of the startup.As a recent report by Wired said that Thinking Machine Labs rejected staggering $1 billion offer from Meta to join its Superintelligence Lab. The compensation packages ranged from $200 million to $1 billion over multiple years—to lure top AI researchers from Murati’s startup.One of the top researcher as Meta Soumith Chintala has confirmed his new role at Thinking Machines Lab via posts shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) and LinkedIn.In the lengthy post shared he praised his team and departure marks the end of an 11-year run at Meta, where he spent nearly eight years leading PyTorch’s development.“I'm stepping down from PyTorch and leaving Meta on November 17th. Eleven years at Meta. Nearly all my professional life. Making many friends for life. Almost eight years leading PyTorch, taking it from nothing to 90%+ adoption in AI. Walking away from this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I'm leaving with a full heart,” wrote Chintala.Chintala’s exit from Meta comes at a time when major restructuring is happening at the company. Facebook-parent recently reorganized its AI efforts into a new Superintelligence Labs division led by Alexandr Wang, former CEO of Scale AI. The company has also recently made some aggressive hiring from rivals like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Apple.Also, some recent online reports suggest that Meta’s chief AI scientist and founder of FAIR, Yann LeCun is preparing to leave the company.Thinking Machines Lab, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, is reportedly in early discussions to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of roughly $50 billion. According to a report in Bloomberg, the new financing, which has not been previously reported, would more than quadruple the startup’s valuation from July and catapult Thinking Machines into the upper ranks of the most valuable private companies less than a year after it launched.The terms are reportedly still being negotiated and could shift, the people said, requesting anonymity because the details are private. While several sources said the target valuation is about $50 billion, others indicated it could climb as high as $55 billion to $60 billion.Launched in February, the company is building AI models and tools designed to support more “human-AI collaboration” across industries.","Soumith Chintala, one of Meta’s most influential AI leaders, has joined Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati.

Hidden advantages of building AI infrastructure in space





Unlimited solar energy

Natural cooling

Freedom from regulations

What Sunar Pichai, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos imagine

Elon Musk is imagining a lunar digital backbone for future Moon and Mars settlers.

Jeff Bezos wants to push Amazon Web Services beyond Earth and into a space-based cloud.

Big tech steps into space-based AI infrastructure





Elon Musk’s vision for AI powered by the Sun









The excitement around artificial intelligence has already reached extraordinary heights, yet the world’s richest tech leaders are now looking far beyond Earth. They believe the next generation of AI will demand such enormous computing power that traditional data centres may no longer be enough. This has pushed the idea of building data centres in outer space, and even on the Moon, into serious consideration. What once sounded like science fiction is now a growing conversation among billionaires, aerospace engineers, and AI executives. With energy supplies tightening on Earth and strict regulations slowing the development of new facilities, space is beginning to appear not just attractive but necessary. Many now see it as the next major frontier for global computing.Jeff Bezos recently referred to the Moon as “a gift from the universe” while discussing its potential as a hub for industrial and AI infrastructure. His ambitions align with those of other tech leaders. Blue Origin and SpaceX are focused on reducing the cost of routine space travel. Google has launched Project Suncatcher , a lunar computing initiative. Nvidia and startups like Starcloud are exploring space-based GPU farms.Elon Musk is planning AI servers powered by solar-equipped Starlink satellites deployed in orbit. What once seemed like science fiction is now being seriously considered in corporate strategy discussions.Currently, establishing data centres in space is extremely expensive. However, research by Phil Metzger, a former NASA scientist and professor at the University of Central Florida, indicates that the business case could become viable within a decade.Metzger suggests that the energy demands of AI could accelerate the industrialisation of space: “AI servers in space represent the first real business case that will lead to many more.” The point is clear: as AI electricity consumption skyrockets, off-planet infrastructure may become a practical necessity.On Earth, AI’s energy demands are already creating strain. The United States has declared an energy emergency and warned that the electrical grid requires significant expansion in the coming years according to OpenAI. Companies such as xAI are temporarily using gas turbines to sustain AI model training, while OpenAI advocates for public-private partnerships to add up to 100 gigawatts of new capacity per year.To put this into perspective, while fictional depictions like Back to the Future dramatised 1.21 gigawatts, today 1 gigawatt is only half the output of the Hoover Dam. Tech leaders are now speaking in terms of hundreds of gigawatts or even terawatts, far exceeding the energy consumption of many entire nations, a level of demand that underscores the unprecedented scale and urgency of modern computational infrastructure growth across global energy systems.Outer space offers unique advantages for AI infrastructure:Above Earth’s atmosphere, sunlight is constant. There is no night, no clouds, and no weather disruptions. Solar panels can operate at peak efficiency continuously.Space provides a vacuum that naturally dissipates heat, overcoming one of the most expensive challenges for terrestrial data centres.Data centre expansion on Earth often faces zoning disputes, environmental reviews, and local opposition. Bezos has noted that in space, costs could be lower and regulatory obstacles eliminated.Alphabet’s Project Suncatcher represents a cautious first step into space-based AI. The initiative plans to launch two prototype satellites by 2027 to test machine-learning hardware in orbit and evaluate early-stage training infrastructure. Sundar Pichai described it as a “complex engineering challenge” but emphasised its necessity for the future of AI.Elon Musk has proposed a bold vision involving solar-powered Starlink satellites equipped with high-speed lasers for data transfer. His plan includes a distributed network of orbital data centres capable of generating 100 gigawatts of solar power annually.Musk’s long-term vision is even more ambitious, aiming for Moon-based factories producing AI-enabled satellites that could harness 100 terawatts per year. Satellites would be launched using a mass driver, an electromagnetic catapult, to maximise solar power capture for computing purposes.","The next generation of AI will demand such computing power that traditional data centres may no longer be enough.

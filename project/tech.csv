Busch cited demographic trends and untapped market potential as key growth drivers, pointing to ""shrinking populations and the low level of mechanisation at small and medium-sized companies.""The announcement came as Siemens released its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, which highlighted ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. Despite these headwinds, the company's Profit Industrial Business achieved €3.1 billion with a 15.5% profit margin.Looking ahead, Siemens expects modest macroeconomic growth in the coming year.

India's largest merger and acquisition deal in the media and entertainment (M&E) sector has concluded, with the merger of Viacom18's TV and digital businesses into Star India securing all necessary regulatory approvals in India and abroad. In February, Reliance Industries (RIL), Viacom18 Media and The Walt Disney Company had signed an agreement to combine Viacom18 and Star India's assets to create India's largest M&E company, forming a powerful joint venture valued at over Rs 70,000 crore. This new entity is poised to become India's largest media and entertainment company, generating an estimated annual revenue of Rs 26,000 crore. The combined entity will leverage the strengths of both Reliance and Disney to deliver a wide range of content across television and digital platforms. This includes popular TV channels like Star and Colors, as well as leading OTT platforms JioCinema and Hotstar .It has received the mandatory regulatory clearances from NCLT and fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI). On August 27 this year, CCI approved the transaction subject to compliance with certain voluntary modifications offered by the parties.The joint venture aims to provide Indian viewers with a diverse portfolio of entertainment, including movies, TV shows, and sports, at affordable prices. By capitalizing on India's growing digital market, the company is well-positioned to compete with global giants like Amazon, Netflix, and SonyLiv.The JV operates over 100 TV channels and produces 30,000-plus hours of TV entertainment content annually. Through its two OTT platforms, JioCinema and Hotstar, it will have an aggregate subscription base of over 50 million and will compete with Amazon, Netflix and SonyLiv.The company's new digital destination, JioStar.com, showcases the merger's tagline ""forging a new path to inspire a billion imaginations"" and currently serves as the company's webpage, rather than a streaming platform, as previously rumoured.Nita Ambani will assume the role of Chairperson, while Uday Shankar will serve as Vice-Chairperson, providing strategic guidance.Reliance Industries will hold a majority stake of 46.82%, followed by Disney with 36.84%, and Viacom18 with 16.34%.Reliance has acquired a 13.01% stake in Paramount Global, further strengthening its position in the global entertainment landscape.The JV will be spearheaded by three CEOs -- Kevin Vaz, Kiran Mani and Sanjog Gupta -- who will together lead the company. Kevin Vaz, who will head the entertainment business across platforms; Kiran Mani, who will take charge of the combined digital business; and Sanjog Gupta, who will lead the combined sports business.""Our deep creative expertise and relationship with Disney, along with our unmatched understanding of the Indian consumer will ensure unparalleled content choices at affordable prices for Indian viewers. I am very excited about the JV's future and wish it all the success,"" he said.Robert A Iger, CEO, The Walt Disney Company, said this is an exciting moment for our two companies.

767 Production End:

777X Rollout Delay

:

Aerospace giant Boeing announced plans this week to lay off approximately 17,000 employees, equating to 10% of its global workforce. The cuts, which are expected to take effect in mid-January, are part of a broader effort to reduce costs and streamline operations. The company has about 170,000 employees worldwide, many of them working in manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Washington state.“We will continue forward with our previously announced actions to reduce our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and a more focused and streamlined set of priorities,” CEO Kelly Ortberg wrote to staff. “These structural changes are important to our competitiveness and will help us deliver more value to our customers over the long term,” he added.CEO Ortberg, who assumed the role in August, cited financial challenges and the need for structural changes to remain competitive. The layoffs will impact employees across all levels, including executives, managers, and workers in manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and Washington state.Ortberg told employees in a memo last month that the job cuts would include executives, managers and employees. “Our business is in a difficult position, and it is hard to overstate the challenges we face together,” Ortberg told staff, saying that the situation “requires tough decisions, and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term.”In addition to the layoffs, Boeing announced the end of 767 production in 2027 and a delay in the 777X rollout to 2026. The latter delay is attributed to the recent discovery of a defective part that grounded test flights earlier this year.In addition to the layoffs, Boeing made several other strategic decisions:The company will cease production of the 767 aircraft in 2027, following the completion of current orders.The rollout of the new 777X has been pushed back to 2026 due to the discovery of a defective part and subsequent grounding of test flights.The company has faced a tumultuous year, including a strike involving 33,000 workers in the Seattle area that halted production of several key aircraft models. The strike, which ended on November 5th, was prompted by workers' rejection of a tentative contract agreement.Boeing has been under significant financial pressure and has taken steps to shore up its finances, including a $24 billion fundraising effort. The company has also faced numerous safety and regulatory challenges, including the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes.","Boeing announced plans this week to lay off approximately 17,000 employees, equating to 10% of its global workforce.

Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy recently emphasised his stance on prioritising hard work over work-life balance at the CNBC Global Leadership Summit. Known for his long-standing advocacy for hard work, Murthy reiterated that India, as a developing nation facing numerous challenges, needs individuals willing to work hard for its progress. Highlighting a critical need for a strong work ethic, Murthy cited examples from both his career and the Indian government, pointing to the dedication of public officials as a model to follow. His remarks have reignited discussions on work culture, productivity, and the pursuit of national growth.Murthy began his discussion by referencing a statement made by KV Kamath, Independent Director and Non-Executive Chairman of Jio Financial Services. Kamath, according to Murthy, stressed that as a nation with considerable socioeconomic challenges, India should be more concerned with development rather than with promoting a traditional work-life balance. Murthy echoed this sentiment, arguing that the country’s growth and development demand dedication and resilience from its workforce.Murthy lauded the hard work of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his cabinet, and numerous bureaucrats who often work extended hours in service to the nation. He remarked, ""When PM Modi is working 100 hours a week, the only way to show our appreciation for the things that are happening around us is by our work.” The Infosys founder suggested that emulating such dedication across various sectors could create significant progress.Murthy expressed dissatisfaction with India's transition from a six-day work week to a five-day one in 1986, suggesting that the reduced work schedule may hamper progress in a developing country. He emphasised, ""We need to work hard in this country. There is no substitute for hard work. Even if you are the most intelligent guy, you have to work hard."" This perspective underscores Murthy's belief that India's development trajectory requires a consistent and intensified work effort.As an example of his commitment, Murthy shared his own work routine, explaining that he worked for over 14 hours daily, starting his day at 6:30 am and finishing at 8:40 pm, six and a half days each week, until he retired. ""I'm proud of it,"" he stated, describing his schedule as reflective of the dedication he believes is necessary for meaningful progress. Murthy’s anecdote serves to illustrate his belief that personal sacrifices in time and leisure are worthwhile when dedicated to a larger purpose, such as building a successful organisation or contributing to national development.","Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy emphasised his stance on prioritising hard work over work-life balance at the CNBC Global Leadership Summit.

Ban on WhatsApp in India: Here's what Supreme Court said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/supreme-court-rejects-pil-seeking-whatsapp-ban-in-india/articleshow/115305195.cms,"Representative image

What the PIL claimed

Omanakuttan appealed in Kerala HC

The Supreme Court on Thursday (November 14) dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) raising concerns about the privacy, integrity, and security of WhatsApp . The petition sought direction to the central government to ban the operations of the messaging service alleging that it does not function in conformity with the new Information Technology Rules (IT Rules).A bench of Justices M M Sundresh and Aravind Kumar said it’s not inclined to entertain the plea filed by Kerala resident Omanakuttan KG, a software engineer, as per a report by PTI.The PIL was filed by Omanakuttan, highlighting a vulnerability in the Android application that allows unauthorised replacement of media files. It alleged that WhatsApp violated the fundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and posed a potential threat to national interest and national security.Omanakuttan argued that this vulnerability could be exploited to breach the privacy, integrity, and security of communications, potentially even by individuals without specialised technical skills.This is not the first time Omanakuttan has raised this issue. The petitioner had moved the Kerala High Court seeking directions to the central government to ban WhatsApp if it does not comply with the orders issued by government authorities. In 2021, the Kerala High Court dismissed a similar plea for being 'premature’.That plea also sought to compel WhatsApp to comply with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.The 2021 IT Rules, which mandate social media intermediaries like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter (now X) to trace the origin of messages, have been a point of contention. WhatsApp challenged these rules in the Delhi High Court.","The Supreme Court dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) raising concerns about the privacy, integrity, and security of WhatsApp. The petition sought direction to the central government to ban the operations of the messaging service alleging that it does not function in conformity with the new Information Technology Rules (IT Rules)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115305192,imgsize-32030,width-400,resizemode-4/115305192.jpg"

Government to Amazon and Elon Musk's Starlink: Your satellite application can be processed only after ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-amazon-and-elon-musks-starlink-your-satellite-application-can-be-processed-only-after-/articleshow/115124999.cms,"Strict security guidelines and declaration

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha Murthy, recently shared some insights from their lives. The couple were the star guests on the popular talk show The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show where they delighted the audience with candid, humorous stories from their personal lives.One of the show’s highlights was Narayana Murthy’s funny confession about forgetting their 25th wedding anniversary. He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went ‘In America this never happens!’, but I went ‘India main it happens though’, who can remember these things??”","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha, recently shared some insights from their lives.

Popular YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia , better known as BeerBiceps, has recently revealed a surprising incident from his early fitness journey. In a candid conversation on his YouTube channel, Allahbadia shared that he was once banned from a gym in Mumbai.In a recent interview with Kamiya Jani, founder of @curly.tales, he revealed that he was banned from a gym in Mumbai. Allahbadia revealed that he began his journey into content creation by sharing workout videos on YouTube. He filmed the initial content for his channel, BeerBiceps, at a gym in Wadala.To avoid the crowds, Allahbadia developed a routine of visiting the gym around 2 PM. He mentioned that with fewer people in the gym, he felt more comfortable and found it easier to record content for his channel.However, Allahbadia's growing popularity didn't sit well with the gym's trainers and he was banned from the gym. “The trainers were angry with me because I was growing. So, they banned me from the gym. I was very sad and upset,” said Allahbadia. He also revealed that the gym was later shut down.He also added that the incident proved to be a turning point in his career and he decided to set up his own home gym, which allowed him to continue his fitness journey without any restrictions.

Attorney General initiates health and privacy investigation

Vice President Teodoro Nguema calls for accountability

Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga , is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos allegedly involving him in intimate encounters with multiple individuals. Originally investigated for alleged fraud, Engonga now faces public backlash and intensified scrutiny over his professional conduct and personal life. This controversy has sparked widespread reaction on social media and raised questions regarding ethics, public responsibility, and potential health risks associated with his actions. As the scandal unfolds, government authorities have initiated an official investigation, underscoring the increasing call for accountability among public officials in Equatorial Guinea.The scandal began when investigators, initially looking into Engonga for suspected fraud, reportedly discovered over 400 videos on his computer depicting private interactions with various individuals. These encounters allegedly involved multiple partners, including his brother’s wife, a cousin, and a relative of the President. According to sources, the videos were filmed in locations such as Engonga’s office, hotels, and even restrooms, with all recorded interactions believed to be consensual.Once leaked, the videos rapidly circulated across social media, sparking outrage and debate among citizens. Public response to the videos has varied, with many questioning the ethical standards of a high-ranking public official engaging in such activities, while others raised concerns about the privacy breach that led to the leak. Posts across social platforms criticised the conduct of a figure responsible for financial investigations, with some users highlighting the discrepancy between his public role and personal actions.In response to the viral scandal, Equatorial Guinea’s Attorney General’s Office, led by Anatolio Nzang Nguema, launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video leak. According to a spokesperson, authorities are assessing whether Engonga’s actions may have posed health risks, which could result in additional charges if confirmed.“If proven, he could face charges for endangering public health,” the spokesperson commented, emphasising that the investigation will extend beyond the videos themselves to assess any potential impact on public health.This probe into health risks marks a significant expansion of the investigation, as the Attorney General’s office examines both the privacy concerns involved in the leak and the broader implications of Engonga’s behaviour on public welfare. The investigation is expected to review the conduct of government officials and enforce measures to maintain accountability.In a public statement, Vice President Teodoro Nguema took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the scandal, emphasising the need for accountability among public officials. Nguema noted that government offices must be strictly reserved for official duties, signalling disapproval of the misuse of government resources and office spaces for personal purposes.Nguema announced that the government would be implementing new, stricter policies to ensure that misconduct within the administration is met with serious disciplinary action. He further stated that officials found guilty of misusing their authority or resources could face termination or other consequences as deemed appropriate. This stance reflects a broader governmental shift towards enforcing ethical standards and reinforces the message that public officials will be held responsible for their actions, especially when it comes to misuse of office privileges.Engonga, a married man and father of six, holds a prominent position at ANIF, leading financial investigations and initiatives against corruption. However, his involvement in the leaked videos has placed his career and reputation under intense public scrutiny. The scandal has opened a wider debate on the expectations placed on public officials, with many citizens questioning whether private conduct should impact public responsibility and ethical standards.As public opinion continues to weigh in, some have called for Engonga’s resignation, while others argue that privacy should protect personal matters unless they directly impact professional duties. The case has ignited a conversation on the balance between privacy and public accountability, particularly when it comes to those in leadership roles within the government.","Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency, Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos.

(Check Point)

How these hackers are attacking systems

How WIRTE is linked to Hamas

A Hamas-linked hacking group is expanding its operations to include destructive attacks against organisations in Israel using custom malware, a report has said. The group has been infamous for carrying out cyber espionage across the Middle Eastern countries.As per a report by Check Point Research, WIRTE, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group with strong ties to Hamas has been active since at least 2018. It remains highly active despite the ongoing conflict in the region and has been observed employing malicious RAR files containing malware designed to gather system information, likely followed by more potent malware with broader capabilities.The report says that in September, a new infection chain was discovered utilising PDF files to deploy Havoc, an open-source framework for advanced cyber operations, allowing attackers to maintain persistent control over compromised systems.In October, WIRTE launched a malicious email campaign impersonating an ESET reseller, targeting Israeli organisations such as hospitals and municipalities. The emails falsely claimed the user's device was under attack and offered a link to a supposed threat protection program. However, the link led to a destructive wiper malware designed to erase data.As per the cybersecurity company, this malware is an updated version of the Samecoin wiper previously used in a campaign impersonating the Israeli National Cyber Directorate (INCD). This new variant specifically targets Israeli victims, activating only if the target country is Israel or the system language is Hebrew. Upon execution, the malware displays Hamas propaganda, including a wallpaper mentioning the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas.The report points out that there are several factors that strongly suggest a connection between WIRTE and Hamas. The campaign's messaging, the consistent focus on the Palestinian Authority (a Hamas rival), historical links, and the use of imagery associated with the Al-Qassam Brigades all point to Hamas's involvement.","WIRTE, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group with strong ties to Hamas has been active since at least 2018.

What Apple said on its support page



“Apple has determined that a small percentage of AirPods Pro may experience sound issues. Affected units were manufactured before October 2020.

An affected AirPods Pro may exhibit one or more of the following behaviours:

Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone

Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise

Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will service the affected AirPods Pro (left, right or both), free of charge.”

What the lawsuit alleges against



“The AirPods Pro Gen 1 were thus not worth the premium price that consumers paid for them—as they contained an Audio Defect and did not live up to Apple’s advertising, which promised quality audio and noise cancelling capabilities,”

A proposed class action lawsuit in the US reportedly claims that Apple falsely advertised the audio quality of its first-generation AirPods Pro . According to a report by ClassAction.org, the lawsuit alleges that the headphones suffer from known defects that cause crackling or static sounds, loss of bass, and increased background noise, contradicting Apple's claims of superior sound quality.The 51-page class action lawsuit against Apple claims the company misrepresented the audio quality of its first-generation AirPods Pro. Despite promoting the headphones' noise-cancelling capabilities and superior sound, Apple acknowledges audio defects on its website with a dedicated page for troubleshooting issues in devices manufactured before October 2020. The lawsuit argues that Apple's advertising claims and demonstrates a pattern of misleading consumers.Apple in one of its US support pages wrote:The lawsuit against Apple alleges that the company continued to sell first-generation AirPods Pro despite being aware of widespread audio defects. The lawsuit claims that these defects, including crackling, static, and loss of bass, affect all AirPods Pro Gen 1 models, regardless of their manufacturing date.Although consumers reported these problems soon after the product's release in 2019, and Apple acknowledged the issues, the company continued to sell the headphones at a premium price until September 2022.The lawsuit argues that consumers would not have purchased the AirPods Pro, or would have paid less for them, had they known about these defects.

Bhavish Aggarwal-led Ola Electric is facing an investigation by India’s Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). The regulatory authority has ordered a comprehensive probe into the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing company over its consumer complaint redressal practices.As per reports, the CCPA has now asked the Bureau of Indian Standards to conduct a detailed investigation into the matter after reviewing the company’s response.The development comes a month after CCPA sent a show cause notice to Ola Electric against poor conditions at its service centres across the country. In a regulatory filing, the company informed the regulatory authority that it has resolved 99.91% of the 10,644 consumer complaints received so far.However, despite Ola Electric claiming that it has resolved complaints regarding its poor after-sales service, the Department of Consumer Affairs critically examined the responses filed by the EV firm, and correlated each consumer complaint with the company’s claims. Out of the total 10,644 complaints, 3,364 pertained to slow service and repairs and 1,899 were related to delayed deliveries of Ola’s electric scooters.In an earnings call last week, CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said that the complaints were mostly for ""minor"" issues. He said “Two-thirds of it actually are just minor issues like loose parts or customers unfamiliar with the software used”.According to the National Consumer Helpline, managed by the Department of Consumer Affairs, it has registered 10,644 complaints against Ola e-scooters from September 1, 2023, to August 30, 2024.

What are the implications of this AI revolution? What jobs would humans do?

Oddly enough, I suspect part of the answer is to revive traditional jobs and those jobs will pay better in terms of the purchasing power of their wages; because as production gets automated, goods and services become more affordable.

As an example, people taking care of soil and water and farms, get paid decent wages because people may want to pay a good premium for small-scale-farmed food that is nature-friendly.

Similarly various artists who perform at local festivals. That is not a job anyone would want AI to do, even if it can do it.

Similarly great teachers are valuable - human teachers will use AI but children would still want the human.

As evidence, there has been a huge boom in live concerts in recent years, even as an infinite selection of recorded music is available almost free. Humans want the live concert experience.

My point is that as tech replaces many jobs, jobs that previously got displaced may reappear.

Part of it is also a political economy question - how do the productivity gains from AI get distributed to farmers, musicians and teachers?

The wrong answer in my opinion is the

. It would indicate the failure of the political economy to have to adopt UBI. We can do better.

To be able to do better than UBI, it is critical to ensure that the technology know-how of AI is not concentrated in too few hands. Just say no to AI monopolies!

Zoho CEO suggests ‘LDI’ as an alternative to Universal Basic Income

Zoho Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sridhar Vembu shared a post on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) where he said that as tech replaces many jobs, jobs that previously got displaced may reappear. Stating that the biggest investment bet made in tech today is in the area of ‘service-as-software’ or ‘AI replacing humans doing the work’, he said that “I do see a large impact coming in software development itself - productivity can go up 10-fold”.In another post on X, Vembu said that the AI era promises even more concentration. He noted “any region that is not part of the tech value chain becomes Sri Lanka - heavily indebted with all economic hope drained.”“Recognizing this problem is why tech thinkers like Sam Altman propose Universal Basic Income - UBI. Presumably Sri Lanka will get a steady infusion of UBI from the IMF so they can import complex tech products made abroad,” he said.He further stated that “the more complex the technology, the more concentrated income and wealth become. We can easily verify this from observation. Tech giants are so big that they have long escaped the realm of micro-economics (that models small firms) and they have created their own macro-economic reality.”In the post, he also suggests an alternative to the same. He wrote “I am going to call my alternative LDI - Localised Diffusion of Income.”“In a nutshell, LDI means we need high-value-adding activities in various regions, which necessarily means the mastery of highly complex technologies - including AI - and then that value created spreads through the local economy as income to the broader population. UBI looks at humans as consumers. LDI focuses on human dignity that comes from the feeling ""I earned this from my work"". I think humans need this.”","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu said that as tech replaces many jobs, jobs that previously got displaced may reappear.

Apple faces $3.78 billion lawsuit over alleged iCloud practices impacting 40 million customers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-faces-3-78-billion-lawsuit-over-alleged-icloud-practices-impacting-40-million-customers/articleshow/115296348.cms,"Apple inflated iCloud fees, Consumer group alleges



Nearly 40mn Apple customers may become eligible for the compensation

What Apple said

Apple is reportedly facing a $3.78 billion lawsuit in the UK. According to a Reuters report, consumer advocacy group Which? Said it will take legal action against Apple. The British consumer group alleges the iPhone maker of breaching competition law by effectively locking approximately 40 million UK customers into its iCloud service. As per the report, Which? claims that Apple encouraged users to sign up for iCloud to store photos, videos, and other data, while making it difficult to use other providers.Apple users get 5GB of free iCloud storage to back up photos, messages, and other content. Once the limit is exceeded, they are required to pay for the service. In the UK, the prices for extra storage in the UK range from £0.99 a month for 50GB space to £54.99 a month for 12TB.Which? Says that it leads to what it describes as inflated fees. It estimates that the lack of competition has resulted in consumers being overcharged by up to £13.36 ($16.98) this year through their monthly iCloud subscriptions.If the claim succeeds, approximately 40 million Apple customers in the UK who have used iCloud services in the past nine years could be eligible for compensation. As per Which? estimates, Apple may be required to pay close to £3 billion ($3.78 billion) to its customers.Responding to the lawsuit, Apple stated that its customers are not required to use iCloud and that many choose third-party alternatives. “We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anticompetitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise.”","Apple is reportedly facing a $3.78 billion lawsuit in the UK.

How to protect your data online

Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid using personal information like birthdays or names.

Create unique passwords for each account.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible.

Use a password manager to securely store your passwords.

Despite the increasing threat of cyberattacks, many users globally and India continue to rely on weak, easily guessable passwords. Common practices like using sequential numbers or simple word combinations leave accounts vulnerable to hackers. An annual report by NordPass highlighted the most commonly used passwords in India, revealing that several of them can be cracked in mere seconds.NordPass says that it reviewed and analysed a 2.5TB database extracted from various publicly available sources, including those on the dark web. The data has been organised into different categories for analysis by country of origin. The analysed data includes passwords stolen by malware or exposed in data leaks.“123456” has once again claimed the title of the ‘world’s worst password’. The password has topped the charts as the most common password 5 out of 6 times. “Password” held this title just once.To protect data online, it's crucial to adopt strong password practices. Here are some tips to create strong, secure passwords:With tech giants now promoting password-less future with Passkeys, users can create Passkeys wherever applicable.","“123456” has once again claimed the title of the ‘world’s worst password’ The password has topped the charts as the most common password 5 out of 6 times.

In a move to redefine online educational tools, Google has introduced an experimental AI-based learning companion called “Learn About.” Designed with Google’s advanced LearnLM AI model, this tool is aimed at creating an adaptive and interactive learning environment for students, educators, and knowledge-seekers worldwide. In contrast to conventional AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, “Learn About” presents information in an engaging and accessible format, featuring interactive elements like quizzes, topic-related lists, and contextual information. The platform is currently available in select regions for testing, with a broader release anticipated following the initial trial phase.Google’s “Learn About” is designed to provide a dynamic learning experience, integrating interactive quizzes and additional information boxes to clarify complex topics. These features, which include suggestions for related articles and videos, help users gain a more comprehensive understanding of each subject. Rather than simply delivering answers, the AI organises data visually, encouraging users to explore concepts in greater depth.For example, a student researching space-related topics might receive links to articles and videos explaining astronomical theories, as well as quizzes that reinforce core concepts. This interactive layout is particularly suited to students and researchers who benefit from visual aids and hands-on learning methods. In contrast to Google’s other AI offerings, such as Gemini, which relies on platforms like Wikipedia for information, “Learn About” sources content from specialised educational platforms. For instance, when questioned about the universe's size, it cited Physics Forums, an established academic resource known for its reliable scientific information.“Learn About” tool by Google is distinguished by its commitment to reliable sources, focusing specifically on content that has academic merit and credibility. Google has prioritised sourcing from authoritative educational platforms, aiming to support users in building a robust knowledge base. This aligns with its core objective: promoting quality learning by relying on trustworthy sources rather than generalised databases.This sourcing method not only makes “Learn About” a valuable resource for academic research but also provides teachers and students with a tool they can trust for credible information. The educational model thus stands apart from other general-purpose AI tools by giving users access to thoroughly vetted academic material, reinforcing Google’s vision of responsible AI use in educational settings.Currently, the “Learn About” feature is only available as an experimental offering in limited regions. The tool is accessible through a web platform, allowing users within the designated testing zones to interact with it directly online. Although the feature is not yet available in India, Google plans to expand access following the trial phase, aiming to introduce the platform globally. As the testing phase progresses, Google will likely refine the tool based on user feedback, ensuring a smooth, effective, and enriching learning experience for a wider audience.In related news, Google is also developing document analysis capabilities for its Gemini Live platform. Recent reports indicate that upcoming updates to the Google app’s beta version will introduce new document-uploading features that will enhance the user experience on Gemini Live. Once launched, this tool will enable users to upload documents and engage with AI in a contextual, interactive manner. By allowing users to access their files and have meaningful, context-based conversations around them, Gemini AI aims to foster a more personalised, document-centred approach to digital interaction.As Gemini AI advances, the new document interaction feature will recognize and interpret the content of uploaded files, allowing for more meaningful and targeted responses. Google’s integration of these capabilities signifies its commitment to expanding AI’s role in personalized learning, especially as it becomes increasingly essential in academic and professional contexts.","Google has introduced an experimental AI-based learning companion called ‘Learn About’ Designed with Google’s advanced LearnLM AI model, this tool is aimed at creating an adaptive and interactive learning environment for students, educators, and knowledge-seekers worldwide.

'Anyone who makes me pregnant in 3 months gets ...': Pregnancy job scams on Facebook men are losing money to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anyone-who-makes-me-pregnant-in-3-months-gets-pregnancy-job-scams-on-facebook-men-are-losing-money-to/articleshow/115291379.cms,"How the scam works

Here are some of the Facebook posts

A disturbing scam targeting unemployed men on Facebook has emerged, preying on their desperation with promises of easy money in exchange for fatherhood.The scam, which has already duped several men, involves fake social media posts and private messages offering hefty sums of money and even property to men who can impregnate the poster within a specific timeframe.These posts, often accompanied by stolen photos of attractive women, lure men with lucrative rewards like lakhs of rupees and even property shares. Scammers then engage with interested men, elaborating on the ""pregnancy job"" and requesting registration fees or upfront payments for ""processing."" Once the money is sent, communication typically ceases, leaving the victim financially compromised.The Times of India Tech team identified eight Facebook groups promoting these fraudulent ""pregnancy job"" offers. These groups feature multiple videos of women offering substantial financial rewards, including Rs 20-50 lakh, a car, and a house, to men who can impregnate them.In one Facebook video, a woman offers Rs 50 lakh to a man who can impregnate her. She promises an upfront payment of Rs 10 lakh and states that men of any ethnicity can apply.Another video said, “Anyone who makes me pregnant within three months will get Rs 20 lakh. He will have to live with me”.Along with videos, the scammers also post pictures of women to lure the victims. Here's an example of the same posted in one such group on Facebook.This scam not only exploits men financially but also capitalises on their vulnerabilities during unemployment. The shame associated with falling victim to such a scheme often prevents men from reporting the incident, allowing the scammers to continue their activities.Police in Bihar have already arrested eight individuals linked to this scam, highlighting the growing concern surrounding these deceptive tactics. However, the persistence of similar posts on Facebook suggests a wider network of scammers operating across the platform.","Scam involves fake social media posts and private messages offering hefty sums of money and even property to men who can impregnate the poster.

“The US government's continued investigation into the People's Republic of China (PRC) targeting of commercial telecommunications infrastructure has revealed a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign.

Specifically, we have identified that PRC-affiliated actors have compromised networks at multiple telecommunications companies to enable the theft of customer call records data, the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals who are primarily involved in government or political activity, and the copying of certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders.

Microsoft 's president and vice-chairman, Brad Smith , cautioned the West against assuming China is lagging behind in technological development. Speaking recentky at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal, Smith told CNBC that China is either close to or has even surpassed Western nations in many technological areas.Microsoft’s Brad Smith said that “in many ways,” China is close to or is even catching up on technology.When asked about the potential impact of the US presidential transition on trade and technology transfers with China after Donald Trump taking over as the US president, Smith acknowledged the uncertainty. He emphasized that Microsoft's operations in China are subject to the approval of both the Chinese and the US governments. While certain areas, like data centers supporting foreign companies, seem to have a higher level of acceptance, consumer services face significant restrictions.“The truth is, as an American technology company, we can do business in China only when we are offering a service that the Chinese government wants to have there, and the U.S. government wants us to bring there,” he said, adding, “And in some cases they look at, say, a data center to support a Mercedes or a Siemens or a Starbucks or a General Motors — there seems to be a level of comfort. In consumer services, not really.”Microsoft has maintained a presence in China since 1992, including operating its largest R&D center outside the U.S. Although Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has stated that the company isn't focused on China as a domestic market, it continues to provide services to Chinese companies and has a more visible presence than many other U.S. tech giants.","Microsoft’s Brad Smith said that “in many ways,” China is close to or is even catching up on technology.

What is the JioHotstar website drama

Reliance and Disney form joint venture

There's a new twist to the Jiohotstar.com website controversy. As a new website 'Jiostar.com' has gone live with the teaser 'coming soon.' Though there is no official confirmation, speculations are high that 'Jiostar.com' is likely to be Reliance Industries ' website for its streaming platform following Reliance-Disney HotStar merger.The JioStar website going live gains importance considering the public drama going on the ownership of the JioHotstar website. Starting from a Delhi-based developer declaring his ownership of the platform and asking for Rs 1 crore to its new Dubai-based owners. The new JioStar website seems to be the company's 'Not Interested' message and not get into any discussions with owners.Reliance Industries is likely to retain Disney+ Hotstar as the only streaming platform following the merger of Star India and Viacom18. JioCinema will merge into Disney+ Hotstar, positioning it as the central streaming platform for the combined entity. Reliance has reportedly explored various avenues for its streaming business. At one point, it considered merging Disney+ Hotstar with JioCinema or operating separate platforms for sports and entertainment.The JioStar website only says, “Coming Soon” and there is absolutely no other content or links on the webpage. It is likely that the website will have content from both the OTT platforms once it goes live.The controversy over the JioHotstar domain name started just days after the reports of merger competing appeared in the media. A Delhi-based developer, who claimed to have the Jiohotstar.com domain, posted an open letter asking Reliance Group to fund his higher studies in exchange for him giving up the domain for Rs 1 crore. ""My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge,"" said the developer then.After Reliance reportedly declined his offer, the developer sold the domain to siblings from Dubai, UAE, who go with the name Jainam & Jivika. The siblings claim that their “only goal was to support the developer and share our seva (service) journey” and “that the domain was not for sale.”“Recently, we received many emails from people wanting to buy the domain. To check if these offers were real, we reached out to some of them. We found that while some offers were fake, a few were serious and offered a lot of money.

Google Maps to soon delete your location history: Here’s what you can do save your memories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-maps-to-soon-delete-your-location-history-heres-what-you-can-do-save-your-memories/articleshow/115282619.cms,"What does this mean for you?

How to save your location history

Google is bringing a significant change to Google Maps location history feature. The tech giant is rolling out an update that will automatically delete location data older than three months from your account.This change aims to shift location history storage to on-device storage instead of the cloud. While this promotes user privacy by reducing data stored on Google's servers, it also means you'll need to take action if you want to preserve your past location data.If you frequently use Google Maps' Timeline feature to revisit your past travels, explore old haunts, or track your commutes, you'll want to act before the deadline. Google has set a deadline of December 8 for users to download and save their location history data older than three months. After that date, any data not downloaded will be automatically deleted.“If you'd like to keep your saved visits and routes, turn on Timeline and choose settings for your data on a smartphone by December 8, 2024. (You may first need to update the Google Maps app.) Turning on this setting will let each of your signed-in devices start saving new visits and routes on its own Timeline. You can also download a copy of your data before it's deleted. If you take no action, your data will be deleted after December 8, 2024,” said Google in an email sent to its users.Here's how to download your location history data before it disappears:1. Go to your Google Account's Activity controls page (https://myactivity.google.com/).2. Select ""Location History"" from the list of options.3. Click on ""Manage Location History.""4. Choose the option to ""Create archive"" and select the data range you want to save.5. Google will create an archive file containing your location data. Once complete, you can download the archive to your device.While this update may require users to adjust their habits slightly, it aligns with Google's broader focus on user privacy. Remember, Google Maps will continue to collect your location data if Timeline is enabled, but it will now be stored on your device for the past three months, with anything older being automatically deleted.",Google is rolling out an update that will automatically delete location data older than three months from your account.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year.However, Nvidia currently holds a significant market share – about 80% – particularly due to its proprietary software used for AI development.The job cuts come soon after its other competitor Intel announced plans to slash 15,000 jobs. The company said that it plans to cut more than 15% of its workforce of around 110,000 people and is also suspending dividend payments to shareholders starting in the fourth quarter.“The actions we are taking will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company,” CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a memo to employees, calling the move “some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history.”",Chip giant says job cuts are aimed at streamlining operations and allocating resources to key growth areas.

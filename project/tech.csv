Building the XR ecosystem









Google has announced that it will launch its first AI smart glasses in 2026. The company made the announcement during The Android Show: XR Edition, where Google outlined updates to its XR ecosystem and gave a first look at upcoming devices. “At I/O, we announced we are working with Samsung and our partners Gentle Monster and Warby Parker to design stylish, lightweight glasses that you can wear comfortably all day. With our partners, we are working to create two types of glasses. First, there are AI glasses designed for screen-free assistance, which use built-in speakers, microphones and cameras to let you chat naturally with Gemini, take photos and get help. And then there are display AI glasses, which add an in-lens display that privately shows you helpful information, right when you need it, like turn-by-turn navigation or translation captions. The first glasses will arrive next year,” said the company.Google revealed that it is working with Samsung, Gentle Monster and Warby Parker in order to design lightweight and stylish glasses which users can easily wear for an entire day. The company revealed two distinct models:* AI Glasses (Screen-Free Assistance):* Equipped with built-in speakers, microphones, and cameras.* Allow users to interact naturally with Gemini AI, take photos, and receive contextual help without a display.* Display AI Glasses:* Feature an in-lens display for private, real-time information.* Can show turn-by-turn navigation, live translation captions, or other helpful overlays directly in the user’s line of sight.Google claims that the glasses are designed to seamlessly integrate into the daily life of users. The smart glasses from Google will offer hands-free AI assistance for various tasks such as remembering important details or asking questions about surroundings. The glasses will also be able to offer enhanced communication functionality with the help of translation feature.Google emphasized that AI and XR hardware must fit naturally into users’ lifestyles. By offering multiple form factors, the company aims to balance style, weight, and immersion. The glasses are part of a broader push to expand Android XR, which already includes the Samsung Galaxy XR headset and upcoming devices like Project Aura from XREAL.To prepare for the launch, Google has released Developer Preview 3 of the Android XR SDK, officially opening development for AI glasses. This gives developers access to tools and APIs to build augmented experiences, with early partners including Uber and GetYourGuide.","Google has announced that it will launch its first AI smart glasses in 2026.

Government to IndiaAI Mission LLMs: Fix bias in AI models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-indiaai-mission-llms-fix-bias-in-ai-models/articleshow/125835571.cms,"How AI gets smart: Unlocking LLMs





The Government of India has directed large language model (LLM) developers backed by IndiaAI Mission to fix biases in AI models, reports Economic Times. Official at the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) told the publication that given the country’s unique diversity, and society, LLM developers must ensure that government-supported foundational AI models should not throw up insensitive results when confronted with challenging prompts, officials at the.AI models may get infused with bias and disparities if the data they are trained on are embedded with historical biases or systemic disparities embedded. Bias mitigation is the process of systematically identifying and reducing unfair prejudices in these LLM models.The report quotes a MeitY official who said “Sensitive connotations linked with caste, gender, food practices, regional and linguistic stereotypes, as well as ethnic and religious differences have to be handled with utmost care. We want Indian models to be inclusive, and not discriminatory or based on historical biases. As a result, all the under-construction LLMs have been told to integrate stringent stress testing into their framework”.The report says that the bias mitigation is a part of global agreement on deploying open access AI tools called ‘AI Commons’. These tools are said to feature ethical AI certification, anonymization and stress testingEarlier this year in October, the IndiaAI Mission invited expressions of interest (EOI) for Stress Testing Tools (STT), or projects to evaluate AI systems under adverse or extreme conditions, the official pointed out.The EOI included testing models under 'adversarial inputs, data drift, or distributional shifts', and moving beyond generic IT load testing.""The sovereign LLMs are a crucial milestone of our AI journey, which should bring the country together. The focus should not shift from this, towards bad actors or miscreants trying to orchestrate a frenzy by feeding compromising prompts to AI. We need to be careful since machine learning tools process data on a massive scale; even small biases in the original training data can lead to widespread discriminatory outcomes,"" another official told ET.","The Government of India has directed large language model (LLM) developers backed by IndiaAI Mission to fix biases in AI models.

The European Union (EU) imposed a landmark €120 million ($140 million) fine on Elon Musk ’s social media platform, X, formerly called Twitter, last week. The European Commission fined X for breaching Europe's digital transparency rules. The first of its kind penalty under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) has sparked a fierce diplomatic confrontation between the European Commission and the United States. Several top US officials, including vice president JD Vance have criticised the fine imposed on Elon Musk's X, calling the move an attack on American free speech. The Donald Trump administration is heavily siding with Elon Musk over the issue. Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk termed the fine as ""Bullshit"".Not just this since then Musk has almost gone on an offensive against the European Union, going as far as raising the call to abolish it. In a post on X, Elon Musk told his 230 million followers that the EU should be ""abolished.""Musk also quoted JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon who recently said that Europe has a ‘Real Problem’. ""Europe has a real problem,” Dimon said at the Reagan National Defense Forum last week.“They do some wonderful things on their safety nets.

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

What Paramount said on the takeover bid





What Netflix said on Paramount's hostile takeover bid





Paramount has just gatecrashed Warner Brothers-Netflix deal. Or should we say that Netflix vs Paramount over Warner Brothers has just turned into a war. Paramount has launched a hostile takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, initiating a potentially bruising battle with rival bidder Netflix to buy the company behind HBO, CNN and DC Studios. The hostile bid comes just days after top Warner management agreed to Netflix's $72 billion purchase. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison is skipping the board entirely and taking the fight straight to the shareholders. Paramount supersedes Warner Brothers entire management team and goes directly to Warner shareholders with more money -- $74.4 billion -- and a plan to buy all of Warner's business, including the cable business that Netflix does not want.Paramount said that it launched a hostile bid after it made several earlier bids that Warner management ""never engaged meaningfully"" with following the company's October announcement that it was open to selling itself. In its appeal to shareholders, Paramount noted its offer also contains more cash than Netflix's bid -- $18 billion more. It also said that a Paramount-Warner Brothers deal is more likely to pass antitrust scrutiny from the Donald Trump administration than Warner Brothers-Netflix.Last week, Paramount Skydance made its unhappiness with how Warner Bros Discovery conducted its sale process public. Paramount questioned the fairness of Warner Bros. Discovery’s sale process and whether it acted in the best interest of shareholders. According to a letter seen by CNBC, Paramount reportedly made three offers to acquire the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery before the company launched a formal sale process. In the letter, Paramount attorneys told Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav that Paramount was questioning the “fairness and adequacy” of the sale process. In particular, Paramount’s letter calls out reports that WBD’s management appears to favor Netflix’s offer.“Paramount’s strategically and financially compelling offer to WBD shareholders provides a superior alternative to the Netflix transaction, which offers inferior and uncertain value and exposes WBD shareholders to a protracted multi-jurisdictional regulatory clearance process with an uncertain outcome along with a complex and volatile mix of equity and cash,” Paramount said in announcing the hostile takeover maneuver.Paramount’s $30/share offer is backed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, David Ellison’s father, and RedBird Capital Partners. Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said in a statement Monday: “WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company. Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.”Netflix on its part has so far made no comment about Paramount's challenge. Last week, Netflix had downplayed concerns that regulators would oppose a combination of Netflix and Warner's HBO Max streaming business.",Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison is skipping the board entirely and taking the fight straight to the shareholders.

“very powerful”

""pretty efficient bunch""

“So we hire incredibly senior talent, and then we hire incredibly hungry junior talent, and we look for attitude and aptitude in hiring rather than experience.

And we do not have that sort of squidgy layer of middle management in the middle, because nobody's ever had a really good middle manager in my experience.”

She thinks this was achieved solely through these strict rules. Blair described her team as a. Blair also flagged that the subscription-based content platform, founded in 2016, achieves this substantial revenue-to-employee ratio, better than Apple, Meta and Google, by maintaining a flat organisational structure.In October, an analysis by the financial and marketing firm Barchart claimed that OnlyFans generates the highest revenue per employee worldwide at $37.6 million per person, surpassing major tech firms. For comparison, Nvidia makes $3.6 million per employee, Apple $2.4 million, Meta $2.2 million and Google $1.9 million, while OpenAI and Microsoft $1.1 million each.In the interview, Blair said,According to a Business Insider report, Keily Blair made these comments during an interview with Jeff Berman on the Masters of Scale podcast, recorded at a technology conference in Lisbon.Blair noted that leaders in big companies are often judged by the number of people reporting to them, a concept she disagrees with.she said.Blair added that there is nofor the company’s staff's career progression and every OnlyFans employee is an individual contributor.OnlyFans, which first started as a platform for creators to earn money from paywalled content, has become known for rated content. Blair, who became the company's CEO in 2023 after years of work as a lawyer, said in the interview that OnlyFans has 400 million users worldwide and 4 million content creators.The company's structure without middle managers fits with the broader trend of Big Tech firms cutting this layer of staff. In recent years, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Intel, and Google have all reduced the number of middle managers, choosing a flatter hierarchy for efficiency.","OnlyFans generates the highest revenue per employee worldwide at $37.6 million per person, surpassing major tech firms.

Silicon Valley’s unlikely transformation





Silicon Valley’s startup culture has long been defined by hoodies, trainers and the scrappy “tech bro” persona. But as the industry’s influence grows, stretching from global markets to political debate, a new expectation has emerged: young founders must pair their technical genius with polish. No longer is it enough to build world-shifting products, now they must also be able to hold a conversation, write a professional email, dress for elite spaces and even handle caviar correctly. And so, the region’s rising entrepreneurs are lining up for something once unthinkable in tech: finishing school.This shift is unfolding as artificial intelligence accelerates and founders face heightened scrutiny. Venture capitalists say today’s innovators must project maturity, respect and trustworthiness, qualities that help them win investors and navigate institutional power centres. The catalyst for this new push is a real event: a high-profile “Etiquette Finishing School” created by venture firm Slow Ventures, led by general partner Sam Lessin.Held in early November 2025 at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown San Francisco, the free three-hour workshop attracted hundreds of applicants, with roughly 50 young founders ultimately accepted. Most were male, early-stage entrepreneurs from around the Bay Area and beyond.Lessin has said on his podcast and in interviews that many promising “AI kids” and emerging founders are brilliant but lack an “invisible curriculum”: how to dress, speak, write and behave professionally in rooms where power is negotiated.Slow Ventures staff, stylists and outside experts delivered targeted training on grooming, posture, attire and communication. Each attendee received a gift bag stocked with grooming essentials including a comb, 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner, mouthwash and a lint roller, plus discount vouchers for Wilkes Bashford, an upscale menswear store. Representatives from the boutique staged a mini fashion show to demonstrate how a founder should dress for investor meetings, formal dinners or high-stakes presentations.While “hoodies and jeans” may work in a garage, Lessin argued that they no longer send the right message when tech is seen as a powerful and sometimes threatening force in society. Founders, he said, must project care, seriousness and social awareness.Alongside fashion and grooming, the workshop devoted time to social skills. Founders received guidance on:Communication strategists emphasised that modern founders must “just be a person”, capable of connecting on a human level rather than defending a valuation model or neural-network architecture.One of the most talked-about segments came at the end, a full lesson in caviar etiquette. A representative from Caviar House and Prunier demonstrated:The segment was partly instructional and partly symbolic, a playful introduction to the elite dining scenarios founders may encounter when courting major investors or attending global conferences.Lessin told attendees that poor etiquette, showing up dishevelled, leaving coffee cups behind, speaking dismissively, no longer reads as charm or eccentricity. With public concerns about AI rising and tech no longer perceived as “playful and cute”, founders must demonstrate respect and self-awareness.Coverage of the event emphasised that the goal was not to manufacture aristocrats but to help founders avoid unintentional social missteps that could cost them trust, funding or access to high-level conversations.Educators say workshops like this help level the playing field for immigrant founders, first-generation entrepreneurs and international talent who may not have grown up around high-status social norms. The curriculum aims to decode everything from wardrobe expectations to networking etiquette, making elite environments more accessible rather than reinforcing exclusivity.Slow Ventures has already indicated that a second cohort of the Etiquette Finishing School is planned, given the strong demand.As Silicon Valley grows from disruptive outsider to entrenched global power centre, its young founders are being encouraged to evolve too. They are learning not only how to build world-changing technologies, but how to shake hands, maintain eye contact, converse naturally and navigate a caviar spoon.And perhaps the greatest irony remains: while the tech world builds tools that make human interaction increasingly rare, its next generation of leaders is being taught that their most valuable advantage may still be the human touch.","Silicon Valley’s startup culture has long been defined by hoodies, trainers and the scrappy ‘tech bro’ persona.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment. The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.",AI startup OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently struck a humorous and candid tone in the company’s recent Townhall with the employees. Huang acknowledged that despite delivering a record-shattering earnings, the market reaction was less enthusiastic. As reported by Business Insider, Huang said that Nvidia’s influence has created a no-win situation with expectations so hight that even minor missteps could shake global markets. Huang also talked about the online chatter and memes about the company’s economic role. “If we delivered a bad quarter, if we’re off by just a hair, if it just looked a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart. You should’ve seen some of the memes on the internet. We’re basically holding the planet together — and it’s not untrue.”Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”Nvidia’s blockbuster quarterly results rebuffs the growing narratives of an AI bubble.“If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there’s an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble,” Huang told employees, according to a Business Insider report.Along with this, Huang also said that he was ‘delighted’ with the company’s results and proud of employees. He further added that Nvidia’s massive influence has made expectations harder to meet a reality reflected in its volatile market value.Huang lightheartedly recalled the “good old days” when Nvidia’s market cap stood at $5 trillion, joking about the company’s recent valuation swings, “Nobody in history has ever lost $500 billion in a few weeks.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Mark Zuckerberg's Meta has committed to providing users of Facebook and Instagram across the European Union (EU) with a choice of sharing their data for personalised advertising, the European Commission announced on Monday (December 8). The move, which aims to settle a legal dispute over the company’s controversial “pay or consent” subscription model, is a direct response to the EU's landmark Digital Markets Act (DMA) under which the social media giant was fined €200 million ($233 million).“The European Commission acknowledges Meta's undertaking to offer users in the EU an alternative choice of Facebook and Instagram services that would show them less personalised ads, to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This is the first time that such a choice is offered on Meta's social networks,” the Commission said in an announcement.Under the new undertaking, Meta will introduce an effective option for EU users starting in January.“Meta will give users the effective choice between: consenting to share all their data and seeing fully personalised advertising, and opting to share less personal data for an experience with more limited personalised advertising.Meta will present these new options to users in the EU in January 2026,"" the European Commission stated.The agreement follows an investigation that found Meta in violation of digital competition rules over its “pay for privacy” system. This drew sharp criticism from rights groups because it essentially forced users to either pay a fee to avoid data collection or agree to share their data for fully personalised ads in exchange for free access to Facebook and Instagram.A Commission probe concluded in April that Meta failed to provide users with an equivalent, less personalised version of the platforms, and the company was fined.

Why Cricket media rights in India are so crucial for ICC

What made things tough for JioStar





JioStar might be seeking a way out of its cricket TV deal. The company has reportedly informed the International Cricket Council (ICC), the global governing body of cricket, that it cannot fulfil the remaining two years of its four-year India media rights deal. According to a report by Economic Times, Reliance Industries-owned company has faced financial losses from the cricket deal. The $3 billion agreement, which was supposed to last until 2027, was expected to cover the T20 World Cup 2026, scheduled to start in February, among other major games.According to the report, ICC has a major men’s cricket event scheduled every year, and JioStar's decision has posed a significant problem for the international sports governing body. The report also cited multiple sources to claim that the ICC has already initiated a new bidding process for India's media rights for 2026–29 and is seeking about $2.4 billion for them. ICC has approached Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI), Netflix and Amazon Prime Video to take over the rights from JioStar, the report added.The report cited executives who know about the talks who claimed that none of the platforms has shown genuine interest due to price issues, leaving the ICC without a clear plan.India accounts for nearly 80% of ICC revenue, demonstrating both its power and the sport's reliance on a single market. The asking price remains steep even for established players such as SPNI, according to industry experts.The broadcaster has even taken a cautious approach towards cricket, despite having bought major international rights, including the Asian Cricket Council for $170 million, New Zealand Cricket for $100 million, and the England and Wales Cricket Board for more than $200 million.The pressure on India's sports media rights is so high that earlier this year SPNI sub-licensed the digital rights of the bilateral series between India and England to JioStar, reducing its financial risk, the report noted.JioStar's problems have reportedly escalated after the ban on Real-money gaming. Industry executives said that while traditional brands have returned, no sector could fill the approximately $840 million (Rs 7,000 crore) gap left by real-money gaming and fantasy platforms like Dream11 and My11Circle.Netflix has stayed away from cricket in India, instead focusing its bets on premium entertainment shows and is only beginning to test sports-entertainment properties such as WWE, which it acquired as part of a $5-billion global deal. Amazon's Prime Video has also kept its cricket exposure minimal. Its New Zealand Cricket deal for India runs out early next year, while in Australia, it has ICC rights until 2027.The investment in live sports has increased globally as a counter to the slowing subscription growth in streaming platforms. However, as rights costs are rising sharply, particularly for leagues such as the NBA, NFL, and MLB, they remain choosy, preferring properties that offer clearer returns to bidding widely on every major package.Even if the ICC fails to find a new broadcaster, JioStar will still have to continue fulfilling the contract through 2027. However, the current sales process for fresh media rights indicates a correction in the sports media landscape. Apart from ICC, the International Olympic Committee and FIFA are also finding it hard to get the prices they expect in India.Executives said several factors make potential bidders cautious. Making money from bilateral and multilateral cricket remains limited, given weak advertising demand and continued pressure on linear TV profits from a shrinking pay base and weak ad volumes and pricing.Linear profits are under pressure, and streaming is still losing money, meaning broadcasters are reluctant to take on significant sports commitments in the future.Meanwhile, the merger of Star India and Viacom18 into JioStar has created a near-monopoly in sports broadcasting, leaving just JioStar and SPNI as serious contenders and narrowing options for rights holders like the ICC.That said, cricket continues to be one of the few proven large-scale audience drivers in India and thus remains a strategic asset that broadcasters and streamers are reluctant to give up, despite rising costs.","Reliance Industries-owned company has faced financial losses from the cricket deal.

OpenAI strikes deal with Broadcom for custom chip





The race for specialised AI infrastructure is intensifying. Companies like Google are already ramping up their efforts and now Microsoft is reportedly pursuing a custom chip design partnership with Broadcom, switching from Marvell, another chipmaker. This essentially mirrors a recent, massive deal struck by its key AI partner, OpenAI.Citing one person involved in the discussions, a report by The Information says that Microsoft is currently in talks with Broadcom to design future chips. “And now Microsoft is also in talks to design future chips with Broadcom, which would involve Microsoft switching its business from Marvell, another maker of custom chips, according to one person involved in the discussions,” the report wrote.This effort suggests that both the funding partner (Microsoft) and the AI startup (OpenAI) are pushing hard to secure custom silicon that has become crucial for large-scale AI deployment, and at the same time, reduce the reliance on Nvidia.In October, OpenAI struck an agreement with the US semiconductor giant. Under the partnership, the ChatGPT-maker and Broadcom will co-design custom chips specifically tailored for running its own AI models.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company had been working with Broadcom for 18 months on the project, which will grant it a “gigantic amount of computing infrastructure.” He emphasised that the chips were designed for inference, the process where AI responds to user requests.The Broadcom partnership was the latest in a string of massive procurement and infrastructure deals for the Microsoft-backed startup, placing its total spending on chips and data centers into the trillions of dollars. The Financial Times reported that the Broadcom deal involves purchasing chips with a total power consumption of 10 gigawatts (GW), potentially costing OpenAI an additional $350 billion to $500 billion.","Microsoft is reportedly partnering with Broadcom for custom AI chip design, mirroring a similar massive deal by its AI partner, OpenAI.

This fund, which also questioned Elon Musk's pay, voiced worries about how executives are compensated, their locked-in stock, and the risks tied to key individuals.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Same investor, different companies, same concerns

Norges’ reasoning behind Musk’s and Nadella’s salary





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ’s pay package has gone up by 22% in the current fiscal. The company’s recent SEC filing revealed the same and the increase in compensation was put to vote at Microsoft’s recent Annual Shareholders Meet. While an increase in Nadella’s pay package was approved by a thumping vote, there was one shareholder who voted against the same.Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund has voted against Satya Nadella’s pay package. The Norwegian fund is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. Incidentally, this is the same fund that also opposed Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s trillion-dollar compensation package.Explaining its position, on its website against a hike in Nadella’s and Musk’s salary, the Fund said, “The board is responsible for attracting the right CEO and setting appropriate remuneration. A substantial proportion of annual remuneration should be provided as shares that are locked in for five to ten years, regardless of resignation or retirement. The board should provide transparency on total remuneration to avoid unacceptable outcomes. The board should ensure that all benefits have a clear business rationale. Pensionable income should constitute a minor part of total remuneration.”In October, Norwegian fund, cast its vote against Musk's unprecedented compensation plan ahead of Tesla's November 6 annual shareholder meeting.Despite the fund's opposition, Tesla shareholders approved the package with over 75% support, potentially making Musk the world's first trillionaire if he meets ambitious targets including growing Tesla's market capitalization to $8.5 trillion over the next decade.At Microsoft's December 5 shareholder meeting, the fund voted against Nadella's $96.5 million compensation package for fiscal 2025, which represented a 22% increase from the previous year. Microsoft shareholders ultimately approved both measures despite the Norwegian fund's objections.The fund holds significant stakes in both companies—$11.6 billion in Tesla (1.14% stake) and $50 billion in Microsoft (1.35% stake), making it the seventh-largest Tesla shareholder and tenth-largest Microsoft shareholder. Its voting power gives weight to its concerns about executive compensation and corporate governance structures.Norges Bank Investment Management's opposition stems from consistent principles outlined in its governance guidelines. The fund believes substantial executive compensation should be provided as locked-in shares for five to ten years, and opposes structures that fail to mitigate ""key person risk""—the danger of a company becoming overly dependent on a single individual.""While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,"" the fund stated regarding Tesla.The fund's relationship with Musk has been contentious. Last year, after NBIM voted against his $56 billion pay package, text messages revealed Musk declining a dinner invitation from fund CEO Nicolai Tangen, writing: ""When I ask you for a favor, which I very rarely do, and you decline, then you should not ask me for one until you've done something to make amends.""Similarly, it opposed Nadella's dual role because ""the roles of chairperson and CEO should not be held by the same individual"" to ensure independent board oversight.Despite these high-profile disagreements, the fund emphasizes its commitment to ""constructive dialogue"" with both companies on compensation and governance matters, viewing active ownership as a tool to promote long-term value creation while minimizing negative environmental and social impacts.",Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund has voted against Satya Nadella's pay package.

Hollywood consolidation faces scrutiny





The US President Donald Trump signaled potential regulatory hurdles for Netflix's proposed $72 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, citing antitrust concerns about the combined company's dominance in the streaming market.""It could be a problem,"" Trump told reporters Sunday at the Kennedy Center, noting the deal involves ""a big market share"" that will require government review. The president confirmed he recently met with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in the Oval Office, calling him ""fantastic"" while emphasizing his administration will be ""involved"" in the decision.The acquisition would unite the world's largest streaming service, which reaches over 300 million subscribers globally, with HBO Max, the fourth-largest platform. According to Bloomberg analysis, the combined entity would generate approximately $80 billion in revenue from streaming, subscriptions, and content production—surpassing all competitors including YouTube, Disney, and NBCUniversal.Sarandos met with Trump at the White House in mid-November for more than an hour to discuss the potential deal, according to Bloomberg sources familiar with the conversation.During that meeting, Sarandos argued that Netflix wouldn't create a monopoly and is only the fifth or sixth-biggest TV distributor. Trump reportedly told Sarandos that Warner Bros. should sell to the highest bidder.The streaming giant outbid rival suitors Paramount Skydance and Comcast, agreeing to pay $82.7 billion including debt. Netflix pledged one of the largest breakup fees in corporate history—$5.8 billion—if the deal fails regulatory review.The deal represents Silicon Valley's continued conquest of traditional entertainment, with Netflix set to acquire one of Hollywood's oldest studios along with HBO, its former inspiration. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav, who initially resisted selling, stands to become a billionaire from the transaction.However, powerful Hollywood guilds oppose the merger, and Paramount may launch a hostile counterbid. Congressman Darrell Issa has expressed concern about monopoly implications, while the White House reportedly held meetings to discuss whether Netflix already requires regulation.Netflix executives acknowledged their inexperience with large-scale mergers but expressed confidence in extracting value from Warner Bros.' extensive catalog and HBO's premium brand.

While not officially confirmed as global headquarters, Abu Dhabi is poised to become its key regulatory hub, marking a departure from its nomadic past.

What Binance said about announcing its new office locations

""global platform""

""But for all intents and purposes, if you look at the regulatory sphere, I think the global regulators are more concerned of where we are regulated on a global basis.""

""Wherever I sit is going to be the Binance office,""





Binanace has been dodging questions over where it would set up a permanent, centralised base of operations for years. However, the world’s largest cryptocurrency may have finally have decided on a location for its global corporate headquarters. Binance has reportedly secured the three financial licenses necessary for opening an office in Abu Dhabi, the capital of UAE.According to a Fortune report, three licenses were granted to Binance in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), a special financial zone. The licenses regulate three different key aspects of the exchange's business operations: exchange services under Nest Exchange Limited; clearing and custody under Nest Clearing and Custody Limited; and broker-dealer services under Nest Trading Limited.The announcement marks a clear shift in strategy for Binance, indicating it is moving toward greater regulatory compliance and a more traditional, centralised corporate structure, using Abu Dhabi as its key regulation hub.However, Richard Teng, co-CEO of Binance, didn't confirm if Abu Dhabi is now Binance's global headquarters. Noting that ADGM is where his crypto exchange'swill be governed, he said:A company spokesperson also didn’t say more than what Teng had, but didn't deny Fortune's claim that Binance appears to have chosen Abu Dhabi as headquarters.The Abu Dhabi announcement shows that Binance is succumbing to practical demands that come with being a large financial company and corporate rules that requires to run the same, even after years of promoting itself as a company with no fixed headquarters.Changpeng Zhao, who cofounded and until recently led the company, launched Binance in 2017, and initially established the exchange in Hong Kong. But weeks after he had registered Binance in the city, China banned cryptocurrency trading, and Zhao moved his new trading platform. Binance has been on the move ever since.Zhao said in 2020.Tax payments and rules also vary depending on the headquarters of a company. In 2023, after Binance reached a major $4.3 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice, Zhao stepped down as CEO and pleaded guilty to failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program.Teng took over and promised to install the corporate structures, including a board of directors, which are normal for companies of Binance's size. Teng, who now shares the CEO role with the newly appointed Yi He, oversaw the appointment of Binance's first board in April 2024.He has also repeatedly suggested that the crypto exchange is focused on regulatory compliance. Binance already enjoys a strong presence in the Emirates. It has a crypto license in Dubai, received a $2 billion investment from an Emirati venture fund in March, and that same month, it announced that it was employing 1,000 employees in the country.","Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has reportedly secured three crucial financial licenses in Abu Dhabi's Global Market.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Elon Musk and Sam Altman: From collaboration to conflict







Although Elon Musk and Sam Altman are now locked in a rivalry, they were once a powerful duo who co-founded OpenAI . Recently a video of 2016 conversation resurfaced, suggesting Altman’s admiration for Musk. In the video, the current OpenAI CEO asks the Tesla and SpaceX mogul a question common among ambitious young people: “I want to be the next Elon Musk, how do I do that?” In reply, Musk shared an insight into his thought process and style of work, explaining what shaped his ventures, which include Tesla Inc., SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.Musk reflected on his college years, explaining that his path was guided by a core goal: maximising usefulness. He identified five major areas he believed would have the most impact on humanity: making life multiplanetary (SpaceX), accelerating sustainable energy (Tesla), building the Internet (early startups), exploring genetics and advancing artificial intelligence (AI).“I didn't expect to be involved in all of those things. Actually, at the time in college, I thought helping with the electrification of cars was how I would start out. That is actually what I worked on as an intern: advanced ultracapacitors, to see if they would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars,” he said.He detailed his early focus on electric cars and advanced energy storage technologies before recognising a unique, critical opportunity in technology that led him to pivot to an Internet startup in 1995.“When I came out to go to Stanford, that is what I was going to be doing my grad studies on: working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. However, I put that on hold to start an internet company in '95 because that seemed to be a time for particular technologies where they are at a steep point in the inflection curve. I didn't want to do a PhD at Stanford and watch it happen,” he added.The rivalry between the two tech CEOs now spans multiple fronts. Since departing OpenAI, Musk has criticised the Microsoft-backed company’s shift toward a profit-making entity, filing multiple lawsuits. In 2025, Musk attempted a $97 billion bid to acquire OpenAI, which he later dropped. Musk also founded xAI – his own AI company to rival OpenAI.Meanwhile, Altman has expanded his scope into space, investing in space ventures like Stoke Space, effectively positioning himself as a competitor to Musk's SpaceX.","Elon Musk and Sam Altman were once a powerful duo who co-founded OpenAI.

When Porsche cars across Russia came to a standstill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-porsche-cars-across-russia-came-to-a-standstill/articleshow/125832938.cms,"Porsche owners in Russia faced a bizarre shutdown as their cars refused to start. A malfunctioning security tracker, designed to deter thieves, mistakenly identified the vehicles as stolen, triggering the immobilizer. This widespread issue, affecting various Porsche models made since 2013, has left owners stranded without official support due to Porsche's exit from Russia.

What brought Porsche cars in Russia to a standstill.





Several Porsche car owners in Russia recently woke up to a nasty surprise: their expensive cars would not start. This happened because a security tracker inside the car stopped working. The tracker is meant to stop thieves, but instead, it stopped the owners from starting their cars. The problem was with the Vehicle Tracking System (VTS) that uses GPS-like satellite connection to function. When it suddenly lost its signal, it concluded the car was being stolen. Because it mistakenly thought the car was being stolen, the system turned on the switch that stops the engine, called the immobiliser. That made the cars utterly impossible to start or drive. The first problems appeared at the end of November, peaking last week.In a report by AutoBlog, Rolf, a major car dealer group in Russia, said a loss of a satellite connection caused the problem. If the connection is lost, the system treats this as a possible theft and automatically shuts down the engine. The security system is meant to protect the car, but it ended up breaking down for the owners.The problem affects every Porsche model and engine type. That means any Porsche with this system may suddenly stop working without warning.The issue affects Porsche cars made since 2013 that came with the factory-installed vehicle tracking system.This includes popular models such as the Cayenne, Macan, Panamera, Taycan, 911, and the 718 Cayman and Boxster. If this tracking system loses its connection, the anti-theft system kicks in, shutting off fuel to the engine and bringing it to a complete stop.Some dealership employees believed the issue might have been intentional, but no evidence supports such a theory. The inability of local servers in each store, which manage such links, to receive support from Porsche's main offices could cause them to collapse. Others felt it was satellite issues. However, the simultaneous failure of the cars throughout Russia suggests a systematic problem rather than scattered individual ones.Some drivers even succeeded in starting their cars after unplugging their car batteries for as long as 10 hours, while others got their cars working again by simply turning off or restarting the tracking system. Rolf dealerships have been instructing their mechanics to manually reset the alarm systems, which in most instances means dismantling pieces of the car. Some of them started working on the spot, while others are still malfunctioning after several attempts. Moreover, Porsche stopped deliveries and ended all business in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. So, there is no official help available for Russian owners dealing with this problem.","Porsche owners in Russia faced a bizarre shutdown as their cars refused to start.

What is RCS messaging





Bharti Airtel finally seems set to join Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea to take on WhatsApp in India. According to a report in Economic Times, Airtel has joined forces with Google, after a year of keeping a distance with the US technology company over offering Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging on the Indian telecom operator’s network. Both companies have signed a deal that would see Airtel soon start offering RCS – positioned as a successor to traditional SMS – using Google’s platform.Unlike Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, India’s second-largest telecom company Airtel had so far declined to partner with Google or Apple to enable RCS. Airtel reportedly took the stand that the alternate encrypted channel could spam users. Airtel had even approached the telecom regulator TRAI seeking to bring OTT communication channels under anti-spam regulations. Google has since agreed to integrate RCS with Airtel’s intelligent spam filter, sources said, indicating the step could have led to the latest agreement between the two. With this, all the three major telcos in India -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- have now adopted RCS. With Airtel coming on board for RCS, stage is now set for a broader challenge to WhatsApp’s dominance in business messaging in India.According to experts, the next step will be negotiations among operators to enable off-net RCS interoperability, a move that could introduce an interconnect usage charge (IUC) into the new messaging ecosystem.“Being a GSMA standard, RCS, globally is emerging as a telco-controlled channel in terms of pricing and rules of service, although it is not regulated by telecom regulators,” said an expert. “As of now, Google is just a platform provider and telecom companies are expected to negotiate IUC among each other since RCS volumes are on a rise, making it the next lucrative business segment after SMS. ”Airtel will reportedly charge Rs 0.11 per message, under an 80:20 revenue share arrangement with Google. ""We are closely working with Google on stringent guidelines for the RCS messages to ensure that these go through our spam-based AI filter,” said a spokesperson for Airtel, responding to ET’s mail queries. “Only once this is implemented, we would be pleased to be on board RCS with Google.""RCS is a global messaging standard developed by global telecom industry body GSMA in 2007 to replace SMS. It includes rich features like read receipts, file sharing, group chats, location sharing, and encryption. The goal was to create a universal standard for carrier-based messaging that could compete with internet-based apps like WhatsApp, iMessage, and WeChat. In 2019, Google bypassed telcos and enabled RCS directly through its own ‘Google Messages’ app, starting in the UK and France. Currently, Google Messages is the main driver of RCS adoption, said to be accounting for 1 billion messages daily.Late last year, WhatsApp made customer service messaging free for businesses on its platform, making it one of the cheapest channel for enterprise communication. The move aimed to enhance AI chatbot interactions and increase the Facebook-owned company's market share in India, which is currently dominated by traditional SMS. Enterprise messaging market in India is worth around Rs 2,500 crore, with traditional SMS holding about 90% of the volume share at 55-60 billion texts per month, according to industry estimates.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea complaint against Microsoft and Amazon on WhatsAppCellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the body that represents India’s top three telecom companies -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea. In a letter to the telecom ministry, COAI has accused global technology giants, such as Microsoft and Amazon, of ""presumably circumventing and bypassing the legal telecom route"" by using WhatsApp to send enterprise messages to customers. The letter claimed that this caused a likely Rs 3,000-crore annual revenue loss to both the Centre and the service providers.","Airtel will reportedly charge Rs 0.11 per message, under an 80:20 revenue share arrangement with Google.

Lawmakers on the US House Committee on Homeland Security have reportedly sent letters to the CEOs of Google and Apple, demanding a detailed account of their efforts to remove apps used to track federal immigration officers. In the letters, sent to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple head Tim Cook, the committee leaders cited the app ICEBlock, which had been used to monitor US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The committee pointed out that hosting such apps “risk[s] jeopardizing the safety of DHS personnel” (Department of Homeland Security).According to a report by Reuters, the letters urgently requested that the tech giants ensure these apps cannot be utilised to target officers or block lawful immigration enforcement activities. Lawmakers have told the companies to give a brief on the actions by December 12.The action follows persistent concerns from earlier this year that these digital tools allow users to anonymously report and track the movements of federal agents, including those from ICE and Customs and Border Protection.Both the tech giants previously acted against the apps. In October, Google stated that ICEBlock was never available on the Play Store but confirmed it had removed similar apps for policy violations.Apple, meanwhile, said that it removed ICEBlock and other tracking apps from its App Store, citing violations of its policies against content that could harm individuals or groups.Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the apps “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” The removals came after ICEBlock experienced a surge in popularity, reportedly garnering over a million users before being pulled from app stores.Last week, pop singer Sabrina Carpenter slammed the White House after the administration used her hit song, “Juno,” in a video showing arrests by ICE agents. On December 1, the White House published a clip showing ICE officers detaining individuals, with the lyrics “Have you ever tried this one?” playing repeatedly, captioned: “Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.”Carpenter responded angrily, slamming the video as “evil and disgusting” and stated, “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” The White House deleted the original video from its X (formerly Twitter) account and later reposted a modified version of the content on TikTok.","Lawmakers on the US House Committee on Homeland Security have reportedly sent letters to the CEOs of Google and Apple.

Digital literacy and the future of work: Reflecting and preparing India’s youth for the digital economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/digital-literacy-and-the-future-of-work-reflecting-and-preparing-indias-youth-for-the-digital-economy/articleshow/125830356.cms,"India’s Digital ID, GST Reform Win Global Recognition From IMF Chief Kristalina Georgieva





India has made impressive strides towards improving digital access, but the country’s digital literacy levels still pose a huge gap. The latest National Sample Survey-based analysis shows that only 38% of Indian households are digitally literate with a significant gap between urban and rural regions. This contrasts with India’s broader literacy progress, over 80% of the population is now literate, a milestone achieved through sustained efforts across government, private and social sectors. Yet while traditional literacy has grown steadily, digital literacy has not kept pace: only 12% of individuals above the age of 15 possess basic ICT skills. At the same time, India remains one of the largest digital economies globally, ranked as the third-largest economy yet placed 28th in digital user spending, reflecting a starling gap that needs redressal ( source ). With the passing of the recent World Computer Literacy Day, it is imperative that we take a step back and understand the current state of digital literacy in India, the role of digital-first tools in daily lives, the need for foundational computer skills for the future of the workforce and the digital divide.This widening digital literacy gap becomes even more pressing as India moves towards a $5 trillion economy and strengthens its position in the Global Digital Marketspace. The country is experiencing a unique demographic opportunity, given that approximately 65% of its total population accounts for individuals under the age of 35. For this demographic dividend to result in an increase in the economy, the young individuals who represent this demographic must be equipped with the digital capabilities to adapt to the continuously changing landscape of industry.Today’s industries are being transformed by automation, AI-enabled processes, and collaborative technologies, resulting in an evolution of work across industries. Routine tasks that were once manually done are now typically handled by intelligence systems, making our role more analytical, creative, and strategy oriented.It is no longer optional for youth to gain expertise in basic as well as advanced computing skills. With this, the youth are not only learning how to use technology, but are gaining the ability to create, innovate, and contribute to the global knowledge economy. Digital literacy now defines employability and begins from using simple software’s to being able to operate devices or use productivity software to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Blockchain Technology, Cloud Computing, and Data Analytics. These technologies represent the core of future job opportunities and will drive the digital economy However, the problem of digital inequality still prevails and the urgency to bridge this divide has never been greater. As industries shift towards automation, AI-enabled processes and digital first workflows, access to digital tools and skills has become prerequisites for participating in the modern economy. Urban India is moving forward quickly while rural communities, low-income households, and women and young girls are often unable to take advantage of learning opportunities due to limited access to resources, equipment and mentors. It will take strong government policies, collaboration between the private and public sectors and a reform in education that incorporates digital skill training into school and university curricula to close the digital divide.Next is a behavioural shift. Digital skills should not be viewed as technical proficiency but rather as part of daily living in the same way that communication and problem-solving skills are today. By fostering the traits of curiosity, experience and adaptability we can ensure that our next generation becomes ""future-ready"" and able to perform jobs that may not currently exist. Schools and universities must change their approach from rote-based learning models to a method of teaching that encourages experimentation, exploration, building, coding and innovation.It is also important to note that the Private Sector supports individuals in entering the labour market via providing platforms for skill development, internships/apprenticeships and hands-on experience in a real-world setting. Today, companies are investing more in training and development concerning the utilisation of advanced technologies. Additionally, industry-academic relationship models will assist in establishing a workforce that is prepared for the digital future more quickly than if developed through traditional methods.As we celebrate World Computer Literacy Day, we need to move from just celebrating access to providing opportunity. Digital Literacy must be available to every young person in India, no matter where they live or their socio-economic status, such that they have the ability to learn, create and compete on a global level. India must become a leader in the creation of its future workforce through the establishment of pathways for learning and developing the types of Digital Fluency that are applicable for the future and relevant to the digital economy.From the expansion of small-scale business ventures through digital platforms for market growth to gig work opportunities for earning potential and youthful professionals launching their careers in leading-edge industries, digital skill proficiency is defining how youth will participate in economic development.By: Eric Ou, South Asia regional director, ASUS","Only 38% of Indian households are digitally literate with a significant gap between urban and rural regions.

Earlier this year, Tesla shareholders approved a pay package of $1 trillion for Elon Musk tied to aggressive targets in market capitalization and operational performance. If achieved, the package could make Musk the world’s first trillionaire. Now, senator Bernie Sanders has joined the lists of critics who are criticising the hefty pay package of Musk. Sanders has sharply criticised Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package by calling it ‘insanity’ and is now once again asking for a billionaire tax.In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Sandaers compared Elon Musk’s 10-year pay deal to the combined salaries of millions of American workers which includes elementary school teachers, cashiers, restaurant cooks, farmworkers, and bartenders.he concluded.Earlier also Sanders has argued that extreme executive pay highlights deepening inequality in the US. Previously also Sanders has described Musk’s pay package as ‘grossly immoral’ and an example of oligarchy, noting that while billionaires receive tax breaks, low-income families face cuts to food assistance programs.Musk's compensation package consists of 12 separate stock grants that he would receive only if Tesla achieves specific performance targets over 10 years. The requirements include:Tesla's board argued that rejecting the compensation package risked losing Musk to other business interests. The board positioned the deal as necessary to secure Musk’s commitment to Tesla's future as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.The vote proceeded despite opposition from major investors, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's sovereign wealth fund. Major proxy advisory firms also recommended voting against the plan.The approval gives Musk significant influence over the electric vehicle company and aims to prevent him from focusing attention on his other ventures, which include SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink.","Bernie Sanders has criticised Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package by calling it ‘insanity’ and is now once again asking for a billionaire tax.

Nick Turley, Vice President at OpenAI and head of ChatGPT has clarified that the company is not testing any ads on the AI chatbot, adding “any screenshots you’ve seen are either not real or not ads”. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Turley wrote “I'm seeing lots of confusion about ads rumors in ChatGPT”. “There are no live tests for ads,” he said further adding “If we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach”.It all started when some users shared screenshots on social media claiming to see ads in ChatGPT. OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT suggestions recently. Screenshots shared online showed the ChatGPT app displaying what appeared to be prompts toward apps and shopping sites. Mark Chen, OpenAI’s Chief Research Officer, acknowledged the same, writing on X:“I agree that anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care, and we fell short.”“We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision.

An internal memo reported by The Wall Street Journal revealed that CEO Sam Altman had declared a “code red” for ChatGPT, pausing several upcoming projects. These included early plans for ads inside the chatbot, AI agents focused on health and shopping, and the personal assistant tool called Pulse, which Altman had earlier described as a key future feature for ChatGPT.The memo said this decision followed an earlier “code orange,” which was focused on improving the model’s performance.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says AGI is still 5–10 years away







The debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry is intensifying in Silicon Valley, and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has made his position unmistakably clear. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.While Hassabis believes that scaling alone could deliver AGI, he also acknowledged the need for “one or two” additional breakthroughs. Challenges include:Recently, Google DeepMind CEO reiterated his stance on achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) – a hypothetical type of AI with human-level intelligence.Despite claiming “the fastest progress” in the industry with the company’s Gemini 3.0 models, Hassabis stated that true AGI remains 5 to 10 years away and will require one or two additional major breakthroughs. He previously said that there's a 50% chance of achieving AGI by 2030.While talking in an interview, Hassabis expressed satisfaction with the development of Gemini 3, which he expects will “pleasantly surprise” the public, noting that the model is “dead on track” with the rapid trajectory DeepMind has maintained since the beginning of the Gemini project.“But on top of that. I still think there'll be one or two more things that are required to really get across the board that you’d expect from [artificial] general intelligence and also the improvement on reasoning and memory. And perhaps things like world model ideas that we're working on with Gemini,” he said.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says AGI is still 5–10 years away.

European Union issued its first-ever fine under the landmark Digital Services Act last week. EU slapped a fine of €120 million ($140 million) as a penalty for violating transparency rules. The European Commission announced that X breached regulations through its ""deceptive design"" of blue verification checkmarks, lack of advertising transparency, and failure to provide researchers access to public data. Musk responded defiantly to the fine, claiming on X that European regulators had offered an ""illegal secret deal"" to avoid penalties if the platform ""quietly censored speech without telling anyone.""

The billionaire also revealed the fine was imposed on him personally, not just the company, calling it ""even more insane.""Now, after the imposed penalty, a new clash has erupted between Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s X and the European Commission after the social media platform abruptly terminated the Commission’s advertising account.X’s Head of Product Nikita Bier confirmed the suspension of European Commission’s X account.Bier posted about the suspension on X, she wrote, “The irony of your announcement:You logged into your dormant ad accountto take advantage of an exploit in our Ad Composer — to post a link that deceives users into thinking it’s a video and to artificially increase its reach. As you may be aware, X believes everyone should have an equal voice on our platform. However, it seems you believe that the rules should not apply to your account. Your ad account has been terminated.”Bier has also accused the Commission of attempting to exploit a loophole in X’s Ad Composer tool in order to amplify its own posts about the fine. Elon Musk also weighed in, amplifying Bier’s comments and framing the move as a pushback against what he sees as unfair regulatory pressure.The EU Commission acknowledged the suspension, calling it a retaliatory act that undermines dialogue between regulators and platforms.

Google and Fortnite make peace after legal fight that went on for more than five years: What it means for Android users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-and-fortnite-make-peace-after-legal-fight-that-went-on-for-more-than-five-years-what-it-means-for-android-users/articleshow/125820518.cms,"Part I: How Google vs Epic Games ‘war’ began



Epic’s offensive against Google and Apple

Google ‘defends fortress’

Part II: What’s new in Google vs Epic Games



Part III: The future – What this means for users







For nearly two decades, the mobile app economy has largely been operated by two giants: Apple and Google . These built safe walled gardens, and for that experience, they exact up to 30% fee on every transaction that occurs within their domains. In their app stores – Apple Store and Google Play – they dictate the rules, control the gates and act as judge, jury and executioner for the millions of apps that seek access to billions of smartphone users. As of December 2025, one of those walls has come crashing down because not everyone aligns with this ‘tax’.In what can be called a watershed moment for the smartphone industry, Google and Epic Games have reached a definitive settlement in their 5-year-long antitrust dispute. The agreement marks the end of Google’s absolute control over the Android app ecosystem and the platform will soon host its own competitors. It is a victory for Tim Sweeney’s Epic Games, and a change for the developers and users who populate the Android operating system. In this article, we will discuss what happened, what changes are being brought and, most importantly, how this will affect the consumers.To understand the magnitude of this settlement, one must go back to August 2020 when the world was reeling under a lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic, and digital entertainment was booming on Android and iOS.Fortnite, a battle royale game developed by Epic Games, was among the biggest hits on the planet. People spent on offerings like in-game currency, V-Bucks, which then can be used to purchase digital goods to be used in the game.Since every transaction goes through Google systems, developers were charged up to 30% fee for the services. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney viewed the 30% commission charged by Apple and Google as rent-seeking extortion that stifled the competition and users’ freedom.On August 13, 2020, Epic pushed a server-side update to Fortnite on both iOS and Android, providing a new direct payment option for users to purchase the game’s virtual currency – bypassing Apple and Google’s app stores’ rule. Epic also said that if users paid the company directly, they get a 20% discount but if they go through Apple or Google, they paid full price.Within hours, Apple and Google removed Fortnite from the App Store and Play Store , respectively. Epic quickly filed antitrust lawsuits against both companies. However, Epic lost its battle with Apple in 2021 with a mixed verdict. The judge ruled that Apple’s ‘walled garden’ is a legal business model because iOS is a closed system, but told the company to allow “anti-steering”, which means telling users about other payment methods. Epic largely lost that war.While the actions by Apple and Google were similar, the legal outcomes were opposite due to the fundamental differences in how the two companies run their ecosystems. Android is marketed as an “open” platform, which means Google licenses Android to companies like Samsung, OnePlus, Oppo, Vivo and others.Epic used this as a tool to attack Google, arguing that the company was hypocritical. It also argued that the 30% fee was artificially high because there was no competition to drive it down. If developers could choose between the Play Store (30% fee), the Epic Store (12% fee), or a hypothetical store (15% fee), rates would naturally drop, and innovation would flourish.Google was also accused of striking at least 24 deals with big app developers to stop them from competing with its Play Store. Google denied the allegations and noted that the deals kept developers satisfied and reflected healthy competition. Several studios also backed Google’s claims.Google’s defense centered on “User Trust” and “Safety.” Google executives argued that the fee wasn't just for processing payments, it is used for maintaining an ecosystem including a security infrastructure where they take care of users’ security and privacy by checking billions of apps for malware daily. It added that the fee also funds Android development, developer tools .Google contended that forcing them to open up the operating system to third-party stores will risk the security and privacy of billions of users plagued with malware, scams and broken apps. Google also contended that the restrictions on sideloading is not anticompetitive but responsible stewardship that helps not so tech-savvy users to not accidentally download viruses.Google also said it faces competition from Apple and if the experience on Android is not unsafe, people will switch to Apple.However, in December 2023, the jury said in its verdict that Google had an illegal monopoly in the app distribution market and the in-app billing market. They found that Google had engaged in anticompetitive conduct to maintain that power. It was a total victory for Epic.Google has agreed to lower the barriers that protected its Play Store ‘monopoly’. Under the new terms of the settlement, the search giant must fundamentally change how Android functions globally. Sameer Samat, Google’s president of Android Ecosystem, said that the proposed changes maintained user safety while increasing flexibility for developers and consumers. Meanwhile, Sweeney called Google’s proposal “awesome” and it “genuinely doubles down on Android's original vision as an open platform. ”Under the new proposal, Google will allow users to more easily download and install third-party app stores that meet new security and safety standards. For example, you love games offered by a company ‘X’. But to download all those games offered by that particular company, you must go through Google Play Store. If the proposal is accepted, ‘X’ will be allowed to host its own game app store within the Android system.“The Epic–Google settlement will open up Android to more genuine competition, as lower capped fees and easier installation of rival stores and payment systems give developers real alternatives to Play for distribution and billing,” Prateek Jain, consultant of ADIF, an industry body that represents Indian startups, told The Times of India.“But the Play Store will still anchor the ecosystem through its default presence on most Android phones, superior app discovery, and a mature trust stack—Play Protect, policy enforcement, refunds, family controls and tight integration with Google accounts and subscriptions—that competing stores will struggle to match at scale,” Jain added.Google charges a certain ‘fee’ percentage as all the transactions go through Google’s systems. As per the proposal, developers will also be allowed to direct users to alternative payment methods both within apps and via external web links. Previously, apps like Spotify or Netflix were not allowed to even tell users that they could sign up for a subscription on a website for a lower price.Priya M Narasimhan, chief business officer, Indus Appstore, has backed a cautious approach while agreeing that “the verdict does open up possibilities for” third-party app stores “and if implemented globally as promised by Google, it will be an important move in creating a level playing field.”“As India’s leading domestic app store, we always welcome competition in this sector given the large potential of the local Indian app developers and diversity of the Indian market. Given that the verdict is yet to be approved, we should be mindful of how the developer eco-system works,” Narasimhan told The Times of India.“Playstore has built an extensive network of app developers over the years, and a global developer may not see much impact in the short term as developers may see limited benefit in opting for new channels, when they already have a global distribution partner. Domestic app stores like Indus Appstore will continue to focus on deepening our offerings and ensure local developers see value and better returns in alternative channels of distribution,” she pointed out.However, Google will implement a capped service fee of either 9% or 20% on transactions in Play-distributed apps that use alternative payment options. Those caps apply to apps first installed or updated from Google Play after October 30. The result is an Android ecosystem that looks less like a fortress and more like an open market.The settlement is essentially the beginning of the operational phase. For the consumers, there will be a choice. In the short term, users might see lower prices as there is going to be an elimination of the 30% fee for many transactions.“The verdict is yet to be approved so we should wait and see how the conditions are implemented by Google. However the benefits of the new structure, once it comes into play, will be direct and tangible. For the first time, users will have a genuine choice in where they discover and download apps, instead of being limited with a single default option,” said Narasimhan, when as ked“Secondly, such a move will also benefit developers. By offering more distribution avenues and significantly lower commissions, developers will see lower Customer Acquisition Costs and improved P&Ls. In a competitive market, these savings typically get passed on to the consumer. This will lead to healthy differential pricing, allowing consumers to enjoy lower pricing and developers their profits,” Narasimhan added.The second major thing is that we will likely see the launch of major rival stores, for example, Epic Game Store or ‘Xbox Mobile Store’ from Microsoft. They will likely appear as a downloadable app inside the Play Store.Indian developers won’t get a separate “Epic-only” India rate, but India already enjoys a more favourable structure than the old global 30% norm. Most small and medium developers pay around 15% on their first 1 million USD via Play Billing, and this can drop to roughly 11% when users choose approved alternative billing options, thanks to an extra 4 percentage point reduction specific to India,” Jain highlighted.With multiple app stores, however, the user experience may become more fragmented. This essentially means that instead of managing all subscriptions in one Google menu, users may have to manage payments across five or six different systems. This means that your account information is stored in multiple places as opposed to just one spot, rising questions on privacy and security.Narasimhan pointed out that at this point, it becomes a fundamental responsibility for any new app store to adhere to rigorous safety standards because billions of consumers should have platforms they can trust.For Jain, app stores must meet various standards. Security is one of them, others being privacy and user experience.“To qualify as ‘registered’ stores and avoid scary warnings, they will need to meet neutral safety baselines, avoid overcollecting sensitive user data, and run purchase flows that clearly explain who is billing the user, how refunds and disputes work, and that use PCI-grade or equivalent security when handling payments,” he said.The settlement between Google and Epic Games is more than a transfer of money or a change in terms of service – it is changing the way people will use their smartphones. The industry gets competition; users get a choice of open market and a less payment option but they will be trading it with the convenience of the ‘walled garden’.The onus will now be on the app stores to develop a robust, secure infrastructure to win users’ trust similar to that already established by Google, and create a privacy-focussed, seamless payments system experience that encourages users to keep using their platforms.","Google and Epic Games have reached a definitive settlement in their 5-year-long antitrust dispute.

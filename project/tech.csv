'Highly Respected Xi...': Trump Changes Tune After China's Warning | Rare Earths Row | Tariff War

Vendetta against renewable energy





China now generates more than twice as much electricity as the United States, solidifying its position as the world’s leading economic powerhouse, according to economist Paul Krugman. Writing this week, Krugman noted that China’s economy has surpassed America’s in real terms when measured at purchasing power parity, highlighting the growing gap between the two nations. The Trump administration’s aggressive stance against renewable energy is drawing scrutiny as a contributing factor to the U.S.’s lagging position.""Yet, rather than having another Sputnik moment, we are now trapped in a reverse Sputnik moment. Rather than acknowledging that the US is in danger of being permanently overtaken by China’s technological and economic prowess, the Trump administration is slashing support for scientific research and attacking education. In the name of defeating the bogeymen of “wokeness” and the “deep state”, this administration is actively opposing progress in critical sectors while giving grifters like the crypto industry everything that they want,"" writes Krugman.Krugman writes that the most obvious example of Donald Trump’s war on a critical sector, and the most consequential for the next decade, is his vendetta against renewable energy. The administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” repealed Biden-era tax incentives for renewable energy projects, stalling the nation’s clean energy ambitions. A nearly completed offshore wind farm, capable of powering hundreds of thousands of homes, faces cancellation, while a solar energy project that could have supplied electricity to nearly 2 million households has been scrapped. Additionally, the administration canceled $7 billion in grants for residential solar panels and $8 billion in clean energy funding, primarily targeting projects in Democratic-led states, with reports suggesting tens of billions more in grants may soon be axed.Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the moves, calling solar power unreliable. “You have to have power when the sun goes behind a cloud and when the sun sets, which it does almost every night,” Wright stated. However, California’s successful integration of solar power through advanced battery storage technology challenges this narrative, demonstrating the feasibility of reliable renewable energy systems.Krugman warns that the U.S. risks falling irreparably behind China by 2028, as the administration’s policies extend beyond energy. ""Does this mean that the U.S. is losing the race with China for global leadership? No, I think that race is essentially over. Even if Trump and his team of saboteurs lose power in 2028, everything I see says that by then America will have fallen so far behind that it’s unlikely that we will ever catch up,"" concludes Krugman.","China now generates more than twice as much electricity as the United States.

Chip giant SK Group chairman Chey Tae-Won gets relief in South Korea's most-expensive divorce case yet; what the court said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chip-giant-sk-group-chairman-chey-tae-won-gets-relief-in-south-koreas-most-expensive-divorce-case-yet-what-the-court-said/articleshow/124613822.cms,"Representative Image





South Korea’s Supreme Court has overturned a historic 1.4 trillion won ($1 billion) divorce settlement awarded to Roh Soh-yeong, the estranged wife of SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, alleviating immediate financial pressure on the tycoon who controls SK Hynix, a global leader in memory chip manufacturing. The decision sends the case back to the Seoul High Court for reconsideration, marking a significant turn in one of South Korea’s most high-profile family disputes.The case stems from a 2022 Seoul family court ruling that awarded Roh 66.5 billion won but rejected her claim to half of Chey’s 17.5% stake in SK Inc., the holding company of the SK Group conglomerate. Last year, the Seoul High Court dramatically increased the settlement to 1.4 trillion won, citing Roh’s “indirect contribution” to SK’s growth. However, the Supreme Court ruled that 30 billion won provided by Roh’s father, former President Roh Tae-woo, to Chey’s father in 1991 should not be considered her financial contribution, as it was deemed bribe money from Roh’s presidency.“Roh Tae-woo’s act of providing large sums of money as part of bribes… violates public morals and other social order,” the Supreme Court reportedly stated, labeling the funds “anti-social, unethical, and immoral” and outside the scope of legal protection.The court is said to have upheld a separate ruling requiring Chey to pay 2 billion won in alimony to Roh, holding him accountable for the breakdown of their 37-year marriage. Chey, 64, leads SK Group, South Korea’s second-largest conglomerate, and the decision delays his obligation to pay the massive settlement which is pending the lower court’s review.The ruling impacted financial markets, with SK Inc. shares dropping 5.6% to 218,500 won on South Korea’s benchmark index, as investors had anticipated Chey might sell shares to cover the settlement. Chey and Roh, married in 1988 at the presidential Blue House during her father’s tenure, have three grown children. The couple, who met while pursuing doctorates in economics at the University of Chicago, saw their marriage unravel after Chey’s 2015 admission of having a child with his mistress. He subsequently filed for divorce, citing the impossibility of maintaining two families.The case continues to captivate public attention, highlighting tensions between personal accountability and the protection of corporate assets in South Korea’s family-run conglomerates, known as chaebols. The Seoul High Court’s forthcoming ruling will likely shape the final chapter of this high-stakes dispute.","South Korea's Supreme Court overturned a historic 1.4 trillion won ($1 billion) divorce settlement awarded to Roh Soh-yeong, the estranged wife of SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won.

China Fires Back As Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs Over Rare Earths Move | ‘Not Afraid, Will Respond’





The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken steps to potentially revoke the access of HKT (International) Ltd., a major Hong Kong phone company controlled by PCCW Ltd. , to domestic telecommunications networks, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported. In a statement, the FCC demanded that HKT and its subsidiaries “explain why the FCC should not commence revocation proceedings against them.”HKT currently holds permissions to interconnect with U.S. networks, enabling direct exchange of calls and data. The agency highlighted HKT’s affiliation with China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd., which lost its U.S. network access in 2022. China Unicom owns an 18.4% stake in PCCW.“The FCC’s action on HKT today is an appropriate step towards ensuring the safety and integrity of our communications networks,” FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said, as quoted in the report. “The FCC will continue to safeguard America’s networks against penetration from foreign adversaries, like China.”PCCW, chaired by Richard Li, son of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, generated approximately 13.7% of its 2024 revenue from regions outside greater China and Singapore, though specific countries were not disclosed in the annual report.The decision places Richard Li’s business in the midst of U.S.-China tensions, Bloomberg noted. Li’s father’s company, CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., is separately involved in a controversial sale of global ports to a BlackRock Inc.-backed consortium, which has drawn scrutiny due to the inclusion of a Chinese investor. This ports deal has become a flashpoint in the broader U.S.-China rivalry, exacerbated by stalled talks for Li’s FWD Group Holdings Ltd. to expand into mainland China, Bloomberg reported in July.The FCC’s move aligns with its ongoing efforts to secure U.S. networks, following the revocation of access for other Chinese state-owned enterprises like China Telecom (Americas) Corp., based on recommendations from national security agencies, the FCC statement said. This action comes as President Donald Trump described the U.S. as engaged in a trade war with China, with a new 90-day truce deadline approaching in November.","The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken steps to potentially revoke the access of HKT (International) Ltd.

Realme's Chase Xu on partnering with Ricoh for GT 8 smartphone series: The industry has not seen such a collaboration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/realme-cmo-chase-xu-on-partnering-with-ricoh-for-gt-8-smartphone-series-the-industry-has-not-seen-such-a-collaboration/articleshow/124609824.cms,"There are two key points. First, we focus on street photography. Never before has the industry done any collaboration specifically targeting snap or street photography, because we understand that young people have a higher demand for taking great snap photos instantly on their phones. Second, this is a very deep collaboration, aiming to be the industry's deepest imaging partnership.

We spent four years preparing for it and closely collaborated with Ricoh GR throughout the entire product design process and workflow.

For every step, both companies are deeply involved. So the two things that differentiate us from others are our effort and time to ensure the ultimate user experience.”

What Ricoh executive Kazunobu Saiki said about the partnership





“This is a very strategic collaboration with Realme. To be frank, we got many other projects from other smartphone manufacturers, but mainly they are targeting badges, which is not of our interest. We believe Realme shares the same idea. They never want just a badge; we pursue the power of street photography for the younger generation. This is a very good collaboration. Fifteen years ago, the camera industry thought smartphones would replace cameras, but I never agreed because smartphones like Realme can create real creativity, starting from the young generation. This expands street culture, and we can begin to start the next generation together.”

Realme CMO Chase on integrating AI on GT 8 smartphones





AI was not used in GR mode to respect Ricoh GR’s authenticity and film-era experience. However, GT8 Pro incorporates cutting-edge AI imaging technologies for creative editing, such as AI removal and festive photo enhancements. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 processor enables enhanced AI features with an on-device experience.”

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

Home Minister switches to ‘swadeshi’ email address

Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India







Zoho co-founder Sridhar Vembu expressed heartfelt gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah after the latter announced his switch to Zoho Mail, India's homegrown email platform. In an emotional response on X, Vembu dedicated the moment to engineers who chose to work from India despite opportunities abroad.""Thank you Sir, for your faith in us. I dedicate this moment to our hard-working engineers who have toiled hard in Zoho for over 20 years. They all stayed in India and worked all these years because they believed. Their faith is vindicated. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat,"" Vembu wrote.Shah's announcement came as a significant endorsement for the Chennai-based tech company. Sharing his new email address—amitshah.bjp@zohomail.in—on social media, the Home Minister requested all future correspondence be directed to his Zoho account, marking a symbolic shift away from global platforms like Gmail and Outlook.The move aligns with the government's broader push for digital sovereignty. IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently transitioned to Zoho's office suite, while the Ministry of Education has directed officials to adopt the company's productivity tools under the ""Strengthening Digital Sovereignty under Swadeshi Movement"" initiative.Zoho Mail, launched in 2008, offers secure, ad-free email hosting with encrypted transmission and two-factor authentication.Its servers are primarily hosted in India and the United States, appealing to organisations prioritising data protection and privacy.The government backing has yielded dramatic results beyond email. Zoho's messaging app Arattai witnessed explosive growth, with daily sign-ups surging from 3,000 to 350,000 in three days—a 100-fold increase following ministerial endorsements.For Vembu, Shah's adoption represents vindication of Zoho's two-decade commitment to building world-class technology from India. Founded in 1996, the company has maintained its ""built in India, for the world"" philosophy without seeking external venture capital, instead focusing on long-term talent development from rural India.The exchange between government and industry has resonated strongly with India's ""Make in India"" community, signaling the country's growing confidence in homegrown digital infrastructure.",Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India.

Microsoft introduces Copilot Actions on Windows 11: What is it and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-introduces-copilot-actions-on-windows-11-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/articleshow/124609538.cms,"How Copilot Actions works





Microsoft has announced new Copilot and agentic experiences for Windows 11. Called the Copilot Actions, it is designed to let AI perform real tasks on behalf of users — such as managing files, updating documents, booking tickets, or sending emails — directly within Windows. Microsoft said that the new feature expands on its earlier Copilot Actions for the web that was first introduced in May. With the latest update, Microsoft is bringing these capabilities to local files and apps on Windows, allowing Copilot to act more like a digital coworker than just a virtual assistant.The software giant said that Copilot Actions will soon be available to Windows Insiders through Copilot Labs, where users can preview the experimental mode and provide feedback.Microsoft describes Copilot Actions as an AI agent that can “click, type and scroll” like a human to complete complex tasks using the apps and data already on a PC. It uses vision and reasoning to understand what the user needs and then carries out the task step by step — but only after receiving permission from the user.This means that Copilot can take action directly on local files, offering help with day-to-day work such as editing, organizing or writing.Users can monitor its progress, approve or stop actions at any time, and even take control if needed.In an official release, Microsoft outlined several agentic security principles to make sure the AI works safely and transparently. As highlighted by the company, each AI agent will have its own dedicated account, separate from the user’s main account, with limited permissions that users can adjust or revoke at any time. All agents must be signed by trusted sources to prevent malicious software from posing as AI assistants.To further strengthen security, agents will work within a contained workspace, isolated from the main user environment. Users will be able to see what the agent is doing, approve sensitive actions, and ensure their data stays private.","Microsoft has announced new Copilot and agentic experiences for Windows 11.

Intel’s mix and match AI chip strategy



Intel Crescent Island AI chip technical specifications







Intel has announced that it will launch an artificial intelligence (AI) chip for the data centre next year as part of a renewed push to break into the AI chip market dominated by Nvidia and AMD. The new chip, called Crescent Island, will be optimised for energy efficiency and support a wide range of uses such as running AI applications and inference.“It emphasises that focus that I talked about earlier, inference, optimized for AI, optimized, optimized for delivering the best token economics out there, the best performance per dollar out there,"" said Intel CTO Sachin Katti said at the Open Compute Summit this week.Intel has taken an open and modular approach, Katti said, explaining that this will allow its customers to mix and match chips from different vendors. For example, this means that if a company needs 2,00,000 AI Nvidia chips and are not able to procure the desired number, they can get Intel chips to get the required compute power.This strategy differs from Nvidia's more integrated ecosystem and represents Intel's effort to position itself as a flexible alternative.Intel Crescent Island will feature 160GB of a slower form of memory than the high bandwidth memory that is found on AMD and Nvidia's data center AI chips. The chip will be based on a design that Intel has used for its consumer GPUs. Intel did not disclose which manufacturing process Crescent Island would use.Katti also said the company would release new data centre AI chips every year, which would match the annual cadence set by AMD, Nvidia, and several cloud computing companies that make their own chips.“Instead of trying to build for every workload out there, our focus is increasingly going to be on inference,” Katti said.Nvidia said last month it would invest $5 billion in Intel, taking a roughly 4% stake and becoming one of its largest shareholders as part of a partnership to co-develop future PC and data center chips. The deal is part of Intel's effort to ensure that Intel's central processors are installed in every AI system that gets sold, Katti said.","Intel will launch an artificial intelligence (AI) chip for the data centre next year.

Ohanian's solution: More human platforms







Reddit cofounder and investor Alexis Ohanian has said that there is validity to the ""dead internet theory""—a conspiracy claiming the online world is being overtaken by bots and automatically generated content. Ohanian's comments echo similar concerns recently raised by OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman “You all prove the point that so much of the internet is now just dead—this whole dead internet theory, right? Whether it's botted, whether it's quasi-AI, LinkedIn slop. Having proof of life, like live viewers and live content, is really valuable to hold attention,"" Ohanian said on the TBPN podcast this week.Ohanian’s comments are in line with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who previously said that he did not believe in it but it seems there are several AI-run accounts on Twitter. Last month, Altman wrote on X: ""I never took the dead internet theory that seriously, but it seems like there are really a lot of LLM-run Twitter accounts now.""The “dead internet theory” emerged as a conspiracy over the past four years, claiming that algorithms and bots were increasingly taking over the online world and would eventually thwart human activity online, Fortune reports.The theory began as a 2021 post by “IlluminatiPirate” on the Agora Road forum and was later written about in The Atlantic under the headline “Maybe you missed it, but the internet 'died' five years ago.”According to data from cybersecurity platform Cloudflare, nearly one-third of all internet traffic has come from bots over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, Imperva's Bad Bot Report in July found nearly 50% of internet traffic was coming from nonhuman sources, including 20% from ""bad bots"" taking part in malicious activities.For Ohanian, the solution to mitigating bot power on the internet involves making applications more human-centred.“I think we'll see a next generation of social media emerge that's verifiably human because it's all going down in the group chats now—that is not novel tech. There's got to be some next iteration of that, because that's where all of us are getting our, really, best info now,” Ohanian said.","Reddit cofounder and investor Alexis Ohanian has said that there is validity to the ""dead internet theory"" The theory claims the online world is being overtaken by bots and automatically generated content.

China Fires Back As Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs Over Rare Earths Move | ‘Not Afraid, Will Respond’

Anduril CEO predicts a long-term conflict with China





“I think it’s going to be a long-run conflict with China, and that’s just something that we’ve got to be prepared for,”

“No country has done more to alleviate poverty in China than America. No country has done more to undermine American prosperity than China,”





Palmer Luckey, the founder of Silicon Valley defence software company Anduril Industries, has claimed that the US defence manufacturing supply chain is too reliant on China. These remarks were made during an interview with Bloomberg TV, shortly after US President Donald Trump announced that the US would impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. “We have to get off the Chinese supply chain. We need to reindustrialise. We need to have our own rare earth supply and make our own chips and computers. China has a lot of leverage,” Luckey said. He also stressed the need for the US to take measures to reduce China’s influence over crucial sectors. He stated that while Anduril has made progress in decoupling from the country, his primary concern lies with the broader defence industry.Luckey added.The recent tariff warnings are the latest development in US-China relations that could affect businesses, Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf told Bloomberg TV.he said.Anduril is one of the most prominent defence tech startups working to modernise the US military with AI and autonomous software for drones, fighter jets, submarines, and other vehicles.The industry’s growth is partly fueled by increasing competition with China.Schimpf expects Anduril to double its revenue this year to over $2 billion and increase production by 400%, with similar growth likely next year, according to co-founder Palmer Luckey.Companies like Anduril and Palantir Technologies have long viewed China as a potential adversary while developing US defence technology.Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar also told Bloomberg TV that tensions between the two countries have been “brewing for the better part of 50 years.”he noted.","Anduril CEO predicts a long-term conflict with China.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged that X (formerly Twitter) is “underpaying” content creators and not allocating payouts accurately. “...the issue is that we are underpaying and not allocating payment accurately enough,” the tech billionaire wrote in a post in response to a discussion on the platform about its creator monetization system.The exchange began when Nikita Bier, an X executive and entrepreneur, announced that the platform would be rolling out “small upgrades for power users” over the next week. A user named Peter Duan (@BTCBULLRIDER) replied to the post, urging the company to fix the monetization model, saying he and other creators had been “consistently underpaid.”“Over the next week, I'll be dropping some small upgrades for power users. Most of these things were quick fixes that somehow fell through the cracks. Stay tuned,” Bier wrote. Duan quoted the post and replied “please fix the monetization. I have consistently compared my pay outs with my peers and have been consistently underpaid.”In response, Bier said he believed the current creator payout program “does more harm than good” and suggested that X might need to move to a new system altogether.“At this point, I think creator payouts does more harm than good—and we need to off-ramp to a different system,” he wrote.Elon Musk joined the conversation, disagreeing with Bier’s assessment. He wrote, “No, the issue is that we are underpaying and not allocating payment accurately enough.”Musk praised Google ’s video platform stating “YouTube does a much better job.”Bier, who joined X after selling his viral app tbh to Facebook in 2017, has been overseeing product updates aimed at improving engagement and user experience on the platform. His earlier post hinted that several quick fixes and upgrades would be rolled out for “power users” in the coming week.The creator monetization program, which X introduced under Musk’s leadership, allows verified users to earn a share of ad revenue based on engagement with their posts. However, many creators have complained about delayed payments, unclear metrics, and inconsistent earnings compared to peers.","Elon Musk acknowledged that X (formerly Twitter) is “underpaying” content creators. “...the issue is that we are underpaying and not allocating payment accurately enough,” the tech billionaire wrote in a post in response to a discussion on the platform about its creator monetization system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124607412,imgsize-25606,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk.jpg"

Engineers now spend their time editing code, tackling the most difficult 10% of programming tasks, and supervising multiple AI models—making them approximately 10 times more productive.""If Claude is writing 90% of the code, what that means, usually, is, you need just as many software engineers.You might need more, because they can then be more leverage,"" Amodei said, describing the shift as ""rebalancing"" rather than replacing.Anthropic isn't alone in this transformation. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan reported in March that roughly a quarter of startups in the incubator's 2025 winter batch generate up to 95% of their code using AI.However, the shift carries consequences for junior developers. A Stanford study found that employment for developers aged 22 to 25 dropped nearly 20% from its late 2022 peak through July 2025, coinciding with ChatGPT's launch. Experienced developers remain largely insulated from AI's impact, maintaining job security despite the technological advances reshaping software development.","AI now writes 90% of the code for most teams at Anthropic.

France targets fast fashion with new legislation





Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein is opening its first physical boutique in Paris on November 1, sparking widespread protests and unified opposition from French politicians, fashion industry leaders, and department store employees who view the move as an assault on French fashion values and labor standards.The 1,000-square-meter store will occupy the coveted sixth floor of the iconic BHV Marais department store, offering sweeping views toward the Eiffel Tower. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo denounced the opening, declaring on LinkedIn that ""Paris denounces the establishment of Shein, a symbol of fast fashion, at BHV Marais,"" according to The New York Times. An online petition calling for Shein to be barred from the location has gathered nearly 100,000 signatures in a week.On Friday, BHV Marais employees abandoned their cash registers to protest outside the historic 19th-century building. Workers cited concerns about cheap labor practices and environmental violations, with one employee telling the NYT: ""Shein goes against our beliefs. We have always been a beautiful store with beautiful brands, and we try to promote corporate social responsibility.""Bloomberg reports that Shein plans to expand beyond Paris, opening stores in five other French cities—Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers, and Limoges—all within locations bearing the Galeries Lafayette name.The original Galeries Lafayette has distanced itself from the deal, stating it doesn't share Shein's ""values"" and claiming the move violates contractual obligations.The controversy has accelerated French legislative efforts to curb Chinese fast-fashion retailers. In September, the French Senate passed measures that would impose taxes of up to €10 per garment purchased from platforms like Shein and Temu, ban their advertisements in France, and require environmental impact reporting. France's antitrust watchdog also fined Shein €40 million in July for misleading advertising practices.Shein executive chairman Donald Tang defended the expansion, stating the company is ""honoring"" France's position as a fashion capital. However, several French specialty brands including Aime, Talm, and Le Slip Francais are leaving BHV Marais in protest.","Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein is opening its first physical boutique in Paris on November 1.

Former Meta executive Nick Clegg says AI hype may be ahead of its time: ‘...could be headed for…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-meta-executive-nick-clegg-says-ai-hype-may-be-ahead-of-its-time-could-be-headed-for/articleshow/124605019.cms,"AI may not live up to the hype





Former Meta executive and British politician Nick Clegg has said that the chance of a market correction in the artificial intelligence sector is “pretty high”. Speaking with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal for “Squawk Box Europe”, Clegg warned that the AI boom has resulted in “unbelievable, crazy valuations. ”“There’s just absolute spasm of almost daily, hourly, deal making,” he said, adding “You’ve got to think, wow, this could be headed for a correction”. He further stated that the chances of AI market correction is “pretty high.”Clegg, like OpenAI ’ Sam Altman, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and others compared today’s AI boom to the dot-com bubble, noting that some of the biggest companies in tech — including Meta, Amazon , and Google — emerged stronger after earlier market downturns.He added that difficult times often push companies to become more efficient. In venture capital, it’s often said that the best businesses are built during tough markets because investors focus more on solid fundamentals.Nick Clegg said that a correction comes down to whether large hyperscalers — “who are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into the ground and building these data centers” — can recoup their infrastructure investments and prove their business models are sustainable”.“That’s obviously going to raise some issues,” Clegg said, as is “the fundamental paradigm on which this whole industry is built, the so-called large language model AI paradigm.”Clegg said that while the idea of AI that surpasses human intelligence — is often seen as the “holy grail” of technology, it may not live up to every expectation.He explained that artificial superintelligence goes beyond artificial general intelligence, which refers to AI systems that match human-level abilities. “I think there are limits to what this kind of probabilistic AI can do,” Clegg said. “It may not be as perfect as some believe, but that doesn’t mean the technology won’t continue to grow and have a huge impact.”Clegg’s comments come as several major tech leaders, including SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have expressed strong interest in developing superintelligent AI systems. Zuckerberg even launched a new AI lab earlier this year to pursue that goal.","Former Meta executive and British politician Nick Clegg has said that the chance of a market correction in the artificial intelligence sector is “pretty high” Clegg, like OpenAI ’ Sam Altman, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and others compared the AI boom to the dot-com bubble.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124605012,imgsize-40902,width-400,resizemode-4/former-meta-executive-nick-clegg.jpg"

A shift toward more expressive AI



Controversy over erotica and mental health filters

Ok this tweet about upcoming changes to ChatGPT blew up on the erotica point much more than I thought it was going to! It was meant to be just one example of us allowing more user freedom for adults. Here is an effort to better communicate it:

As we have said earlier, we are making a decision to prioritize safety over privacy and freedom for teenagers. And we are not loosening any policies related to mental health. This is a new and powerful technology, and we believe minors need significant protection.

We also care very much about the principle of treating adult users like adults. As AI becomes more important in people's lives, allowing a lot of freedom for people to use AI in the ways that they want is an important part of our mission.

It doesn't apply across the board of course: for example, we will still not allow things that cause harm to others, and we will treat users who are having mental health crises very different from users who are not. Without being paternalistic we will attempt to help users achieve their long-term goals.

But we are not the elected moral police of the world. In the same way that society differentiates other appropriate boundaries (R-rated movies, for example) we want to do a similar thing here.”

Mark Cuban warns Sam Altman on bringing erotica to ChatGPT





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has now acknowledged that his recent post teasing the upcoming changes to ChatGPT ‘blew up’ online, sparking widespread debate over the platform’s evolving content policies and personality design. In a now viral post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Altman hinted that ChatGPT would soon become “more like what people liked about GPT-4o,” with fewer restrictions and a more expressive, human-like tone. “My post about upcoming changes to ChatGPT blew up on X,” Altman wrote. “We’re excited to show you what’s coming.”The announcement made by OpenAI CEO follows the growing user decade for a livelier, less filtered ChatGPT experience. Altman confirmed that OpenAI plans to roll out updates that relax previous limitations, majorly around sensitive topics such as mental health and adult content. The company says it now has better safety tools and moderation systems in place to support this shift. “We are not the elected moral police,” Altman said in response to criticism, defending OpenAI’s decision to allow more flexibility in how ChatGPT interacts with users.The backlash on the post shared by Altman intensified after he made reference to erotica, prompting concerns about how far the platform might go in lifting restrictions. The critics also questioned whether OpenAI was compromising safety for engagement. On the other hand, some also praised the company for this move.However, Altman later clarified that OpenAI had previously imposed strict filters to mitigate mental health risks, but now believes those restrictions made the platform less enjoyable. With improved safeguards, the company is ready to reintroduce more nuanced and emotionally intelligent responses.In anther post shared on X, Altman wrote, “Billionaire entrepreneur and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has now criticised OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the company’s decision to relax safety restrictions in ChatGPT which also includes the permission to generate adult-oriented content verified users. Cuban has now warned that this move by the company could alienate families and also damage the trust in the platform. “This is going to backfire,” Cuban posted on X. “No parent is going to want their kids using ChatGPT if they think erotica is part of the experience.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged that his recent post teasing upcoming changes to ChatGPT ‘blew up’ online, sparking widespread debate over the platform’s evolving content policies and personality design.

""Today I lost a friend who was more than a brother to me. He called me his brother, he called me his best friend. I am honored to have been any of these things to him, and was equally grateful for his friendship for more than two decades. I am reposting his final Facebook message as a way to share the news in his own words.

I knew his time was going to be short after I saw him a little over a week ago. While he remained optimistic, he could leave the hospital in a month; I think we both knew that was optimistic at best. All I can say is he suffered from a serious illness that escalated rather severely in his final days. I spent all afternoon with him, wishing I could do more. But at least I was with him near the very end. When I got the news late this afternoon, I was also grateful to hear the news directly, rather than second-hand.

My heart is broken, and it’ll be a while before I recover from this.

You will always be my brother, Itagaki-san. Thank you for everything you’ve shared with me through the years. I owe so much to you. I will continue to honor you, however and whenever I can.""

The announcement was shared in a posthumous post on social media that Itagaki had prepared to be shared after his death. His close friend, James Mielke, co-founder and creative director of Bitsummit, confirmed the news on Bluesky and Instagram.Tomonobu Itagaki is best known for creating and leading the Dead or Alive fighting game series, which first hit arcades in 1996, and for reviving Tecmo’s Ninja Gaiden franchise on the Xbox in 2004.In 2008, he left Team Ninja to start Valhalla Game Studios, where he worked on Devil’s Third — a long-delayed project that was met with poor reviews when it finally launched. More recently, he had founded Itagaki Games in 2021 and was preparing to develop a new title before his passing.Known for his bold personality, Itagaki often spoke his mind in interviews. His honest and sometimes blunt opinions gave him a reputation for being rebellious and occasionally led to clashes with other developers.Translated by Mielke on Instagram, the post says:Mielke also shared a post on BlueSky stating:","Tomonobu Itagaki, the founder of Team Ninja and the famous Japanese game developer behind Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden, has passed away at the age of 58.

Human error remains cybersecurity's weakest link, says Kamath





Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath revealed that his X (formerly Twitter) account was briefly compromised on on the morning of October 15 after he fell victim to a sophisticated phishing attack. The incident occurred despite having two-factor authentication enabled and being well-versed in cybersecurity practices, highlighting how even tech-savvy individuals can become targets of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.Kamath disclosed to his 7.4 lakh followers that he clicked on a ""Change Your Password"" link in a phishing email that bypassed all spam and security filters while browsing on his personal device early in the morning. The attackers gained access to a single login session and posted several cryptocurrency-related scam links from his account before he could regain control.The phishing email closely mimicked legitimate X security alerts, creating a sense of urgency that caught even the experienced entrepreneur off guard during a momentary lapse in attention. The message appeared authentic enough to deceive someone who regularly deals with cybersecurity concerns at one of India's largest brokerage firms.Fortunately, Kamath had two-factor authentication activated, which prevented the hackers from taking full control of his account or accessing it from additional devices. He noted that the attack appeared to be ""fully AI-automated and not personal,"" suggesting the use of artificial intelligence in crafting convincing phishing emails that can evade traditional security filters.This represents a growing trend where cybercriminals leverage AI technology to create more sophisticated and believable phishing campaigns that can fool even security-conscious users.Reflecting on the incident, Kamath emphasised that ""all it takes is one slip of the mind"" and stressed the importance of holistic cybersecurity frameworks that account for human psychology beyond just technical solutions. ""2FA is absolutely essential, but clearly, it is not a technical solution to human psychology,"" he wrote, calling for organisations and governments to implement comprehensive security measures that include human processes, policies, and procedures.Despite regular cybersecurity awareness conversations at Zerodha, Kamath acknowledged that even the most prepared individuals remain vulnerable to sophisticated phishing attacks.

AI’s expanding role in banking



Goldman Sachs echoes the shift







JPMorgan and Chase, the world’s largest bank by market capitalisation has now taken a bold stance on staffing as AI continues to transform Wall Street. As reported by CNBC, JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum has revealed that the bank managers have been told to avoid hiring new employees unless it is absolutely necessary. The company came on to this decision as it is accelerating its deployment of AI across operations. “We have a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need be to hire more people,” Barnum told analysts during the bank’s third-quarter earnings call.Despite reporting a 12% year-over-year profit increase to $14.4 billion, JPMorgan’s headcount increase by just 1%, underscoring the bank’s commitment to leveraging AI for efficiency rather than expansion.As reported by CNBC, JPMorgan is integrating AI into every aspect of its business starting from client interactions to back-office processes. The bank is working on mirroring the moves of tech giants Amazon and Microsoft, who have already warned employees to brace for AI-driven changes.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also recently acknowledged that AI will eliminate some jobs, but the affected employees will be retrained. Still, the bank expects operational and support staff to shrink by at least 10% over the next five years, even as business volumes grow.The CNBC report also adds that the rival bank Goldman Sachs is also reorganising around AI. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has told the employees that this week the bank will “constrain headcount growth” and lay off a limited number of staff as it retools operations to improve speed, agility, and productivity.The memo shared by Solomon talked about a multi-year AI transformation focused on client onboarding, sales, and internal decision-making. While Goldman’s overall headcount is still rising, the message was clear: AI is now central to how Wall Street thinks about workforce planning.","JPMorgan and Chase, the world’s largest bank by market capitalisation has now taken a bold stance on staffing as AI continues to transform Wall Street.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos , has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the tech giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She also previously gave UNCF $10 million in 2020.","Mackenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

MakeMyTrip has introduced a new AI-powered semantic search feature that allows users to find hotels and homestays using natural language queries. The update is part of the company’s broader AI innovation efforts aimed at improving the booking experience.The feature enables travellers to search using phrases such as “pet-friendly hotels in Manali with a swimming pool” or “heritage stays near Jaipur forts with parking.” Instead of relying on multiple filters, users can describe their preferences directly, and the system interprets the intent behind the query to provide relevant results.The search results include contextual information such as images, AI-curated content from user reviews, and personalised rankings. It also provides AI-generated smart suggestions for commonly searched categories like “beachfront hotels in Goa” or “Ooty stays with mountain views,” with tags indicating features such as “great for families” or “private pools available.”“Our goal is to make travel planning as natural as conversation. With AI Search within stay booking experience, we’re simplifying one of the most important parts of the traveller journey, finding the right stay.Instead of forcing users to think like a system, we’ve built a system that understands how people naturally express themselves,” said Ankit Khanna, Chief Product Officer, MakeMyTrip.The company also recently launched the Beta version of Myra, its generative AI-based trip planning assistant.

Why Delaware is on the line



Elon Musk’s role and Tesla’s future







Tesla is back in court this week, urging the Delaware Supreme Court to reinstate CEO Elon Musk ’s $56 billion compensation package, the largest in the corporate history. As reported by Reuters, the legal battle started after a lower court invalidated the shareholder-approved deal in January 2024. The legal battle has now entered in its final stage and the outcome could reshape only Tesla’s leadership but also the future of Delaware’s corporate governance model.Elon Musk’s 2018 pay deal was made around the ambitious performance milestones tied to Tesla’s market value and operational growth. However, Elon Musk has not met those targets and a Delaware judge ruled that the process also lacked sufficient independence and transparency, calling the board’s approval ‘deeply flawed’. As reported by Reuters, Tesla is now appealing the decision arguing that shareholders had full knowledge and voted overwhelmingly in favour.“This was the most informed stockholder vote in Delaware history,” said Tesla attorney Jeffrey Wall during oral arguments. “Reaffirming that would resolve this case.”Delaware, is home to more than half of the US publicly traded companies and it is widely seen as the gold standard for corporate law.But this case has put its Court of Chancery under scrutiny. If the Supreme Court upholds the lower ruling, it could signal a shift toward stricter oversight of executive compensation, potentially driving companies to reconsider incorporating in the state.Legal experts warn that a ruling against Tesla could undermine Delaware’s reputation for predictable, business-friendly rulings—an identity that has helped it attract thousands of corporate registrations and billions in tax revenue.The stakes are equally high for Tesla. Musk’s leadership is deeply intertwined with the company’s brand, innovation, and investor confidence. A failure to restore the pay package could raise questions about Musk’s long-term commitment and Tesla’s ability to retain visionary talent.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is said to earn tens of billions of dollars from a record-breaking compensation package even if he fails to meet most of the ambitious goals set by the bard of the company. As reported by Reuters, Musk could surpass the lifetime earbibggs of CEOs such as Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Tim Cook and Jensen Huang by just achieve some relatively modest milestones. In September this year, the Tesla board proposed a 10-year compensation package which could award Musk up to $878 billion in stocks on the condition of hitting a series of ‘Mars-shot’ gaols.The goals include breakthroughs in robotics, autonomous driving, and massive profit and valuation targets. However, as reported by Reuters, Elon Musk could still earn more than $50 billion by meeting just a handful of easier goals without actually transforming Tesla’s products or business.","Tesla is back in court this week, urging the Delaware Supreme Court to reinstate CEO Elon Musk ’s $56 billion compensation package. The legal battle started after a lower court invalidated the shareholder-approved deal in January 2024. The outcome could reshape not only Tesla’s leadership but also the future of Delaware's corporate governance model.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124599206,imgsize-45134,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk.jpg"

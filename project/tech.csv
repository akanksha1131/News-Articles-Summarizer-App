"Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg says your LLMs are 'problematic', like Meta's; and he is fixing his",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-and-sundar-pichai-mark-zuckerberg-says-your-llms-are-problematic-like-metas-and-he-is-fixing-his/articleshow/125191400.cms,"OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg just said which many people have claimed about LLMs -- that they are biased. In its Llama 4 release announcement, Meta says that it is specifically addressing ""left-leaning"" political bias in its AI model, distinguishing this effort from traditional bias concerns around race, gender, and nationality that researchers have long documented. In a blog post the company said, ""Our goal is to remove bias from our AI models and to make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue. As part of this work, we’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn't favor some views over others.""Not just this, it claims that 'Biasness' or should we say 'Left Leanings' is not only problem of Meta LLM, but one that afflicts all leading LLMs. ""It’s well-known that all leading LLMs have had issues with bias—specifically, they historically have leaned left when it comes to debated political and social topics. This is due to the types of training data available on the internet,"" reads the blog post. Leading LLMs mean, among others, LLMs of Google and OpenAI. ""As part of this work, we’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn't favor some views over others,"" the post added.Meta's blog post further goes on to explain how with LLM 4, Meta made improvements on these efforts and that LLM 4 performs significantly better than Llama 3 and is comparable to Grok. It says:* Llama 4 refuses less on debated political and social topics overall (from 7% in Llama 3.3 to below 2%).* Llama 4 is dramatically more balanced with which prompts it refuses to respond to (the proportion of unequal response refusals is now less than 1% on a set of debated topical questions).* Our testing shows that Llama 4 responds with strong political lean at a rate comparable to Grok (and at half of the rate of Llama 3.3) on a contentious set of political or social topics. While we are making progress, we know we have more work to do and will continue to drive this rate further down.While biasness in LLMs is a known fact, what has surprised analysts is that Meta's post mentions only 'left leaning' bias and not 'right leaning' as many claim in Elon Musk's Grok.","Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg just said which many people have claimed about LLMs -- that they are biased.

Microsoft’s AI Bet Pays Off: Company Joins Nvidia in $4 Trillion Club

Microsoft issues global apology after ACCC lawsuit over hidden 365 plans





Microsoft offers refunds after 365 pricing confusion: Who is eligible and how to claim





Check for an email from Microsoft notifying you of your eligibility.

Switch your subscription to Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Classic by logging into your Microsoft account and selecting the change before 31 December 2025.

After the switch, Microsoft will calculate the refund and process it within 30 days to your original payment method. The refund will appear in your Microsoft account once completed.

What the change involves: Plan options and pricing differences





Implications for consumers and the wider subscription market









In a rare public apology, Microsoft Corporation recently announced it would refund eligible subscribers of its Microsoft 365 service in the United States, following allegations of misleading pricing related to its AI-enhanced plans. The move comes in the wake of regulatory scrutiny in Australia, where the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) sued Microsoft for allegedly failing to clearly present a lower-cost, non-AI-enabled subscription option.Microsoft confirmed it would refund the difference in pricing on renewals from 30 November 2024 and urged customers to switch to the Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Classic plan by December 31, 2025 to claim. The company said the apology and refund offer reflect a commitment to transparency, acknowledging that it “could have been clearer” with its communications.Microsoft’s announcement followed the ACCC’s legal action in Australia, which accused the company of “deliberately hiding” the cheaper, non-AI version of its Microsoft 365 subscription from certain customers. While the dispute originated in Australia, Microsoft stated that it had 2.7 million eligible customers in the United States affected by similar pricing concerns.In its statement to subscribers, Microsoft explained that it added AI capabilities into its Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions and admitted that it “could have been clearer” about the availability of the non-AI Classic plan. The company offered an apology and put in place the refund mechanism for eligible users.Eligible customers are subscribers in the United States who were on Microsoft 365 Personal or Family plans and renewed after 30 November 2024. Customers who switch to the Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Classic plan by 31 December 2025 will receive a refund covering the price difference between their then-current plan and the Classic plan. Microsoft says refunds will be processed within 30 days after the plan switch and credited to the original payment method.How to claim the refund:Microsoft distinguishes between its standard Microsoft 365 subscription (with AI assistant “Copilot” and feature updates) and the Classic plan (which includes core Office apps and security updates but excludes Copilot and may not receive future feature enhancements). According to the example provided in the email to subscribers, the AI-enabled plan renews at AUD $16 / $18 (tax inclusive) per month in Australia, while the Classic version renews at AUD $11 / $14. Though these figures are Australian, they illustrate the price gap between AI-enabled and non-AI plans.In the US, while specific renewal prices were not detailed in the public statement, the refund mechanism is constructed to cover “the difference in price between plans” retroactive to the date of the first renewal after 30 November 2024. Microsoft emphasised that subscribers who already are on the Classic plan and opted to stay there do not need to take any further action.For millions of individual and family Microsoft 365 subscribers, the refund and plan-switch offer represents a significant acknowledgement of value concerns in subscription services. Experts say the case underscores how transparent communication about plan tiers and renewal pricing is increasingly under scrutiny by regulators. Microsoft’s statement, by linking its internal decision to the Australia-based regulatory action, suggests that consumers around the world may expect improved disclosure.Subscription fatigue and rising service costs are major issues for consumers globally. With software companies adding features like AI assistants and advanced capabilities, the pressure to differentiate tiered pricing without confusing or alienating customers is growing. Microsoft’s move may set a precedent for how tech giants manage legacy product transitions and pricing transparency.","Microsoft announced it would refund eligible subscribers of its Microsoft 365 service in the United States.

Fall in China sales hurt Swatch

Rise of smartwatch





In a blow to the beleaguered Swiss watchmaker, Swatch Group is reportedly set to be ousted from the benchmark Swiss Leader Index (SLI) next month, stock exchange operator SIX announced this week, citing a sharp drop in the company's market capitalization and dwindling share trading volumes. According to a report by Reuters, the iconic producer of luxury timepieces like Omega, Tissot, and Longines will exit the 30-stock SLI basket on December 22, making way for the newly formed Helvetia Baloise Holding. The replacement stems from the recent merger of Swiss insurers Helvetia and Baloise, forging what is now the country's second-largest insurance powerhouse.SIX, which typically recalibrates its indexes annually in September, invoked an extraordinary adjustment for this shake-up. The SLI's makeup is determined by companies' free-float market capitalization and average trading volumes over the prior 12 months, metrics where Swatch has faltered badly.Swatch's stock has shed about 5% over the past year, hammered by sagging sales and a profit nosedive—largely pinned on a steep decline in demand from China, the world's largest watch market. The fallout has eroded the company's market value to 8.66 billion Swiss francs (about $10.9 billion), while daily trading in its shares has plummeted by nearly a third this year alone.Swatch shares have lost 5% in value over the last 12 months as sales fell and profits plunged due to falling sales in China.This isn't Swatch's first ouster from the index. The group was already bumped from the elite Swiss Market Index (SMI) in September 2021, supplanted by computer peripherals giant Logitech. The SLI serves as a key barometer for Swiss equities, blending the SMI's top 20 blue-chip heavyweights with the 10 biggest mid-caps from the Swiss Market Index Mid (SMIM). It's a go-to for index-tracking funds, exchange-traded commodities (ETCs), and derivatives, offering investors a streamlined basket of large- and mid-cap Swiss stocks.For Swatch, the demotion underscores broader headwinds in the luxury goods sector, where economic jitters and shifting consumer tastes in Asia have squeezed margins. Analysts say the index snub could further pressure the stock, already trading at multi-year lows, as passive investors rebalance away from the watchmaker.Over the past five years, Swatch Group's financial performance has weakened substantially, underperforming both the broader market and its main rivals. Meanwhile, the rise of smartwatches like those offered by Apple have eaten into the lower-price watch segment where Swatch Group traditionally led. Its shares have correspondingly lost significant ground, delivering an abysmal total return performance.","Swatch Group is reportedly set to be ousted from the benchmark Swiss Leader Index (SLI) next month.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide. The funding aims to fuel dozens of projects, from life-saving maternal medicines to vaccines targeting infections that hit women hardest. The pledge marks a roughly 33% jump in the foundation's investments in women's and maternal health compared to the prior half-decade. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health. The pledge also is a sign of the areas where Bill Gates wants to focus on as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. Gates spoke about the pledge during an event with STAT this week.The vast majority of the funds — as much as 70% — will go to research and development. About a tenth will go to market introduction of new technologies or generating better data around them. Only about 4% will go to manufacturing, and 3% to advocacy. ""It's curious why some of these areas are so under-invested, because the rich world health burden on preeclampsia specifically is still, you know, very high,"" Gates remarked during a briefing, highlighting one of the hypertensive disorders that claim thousands of women's lives annually, even in wealthy nations.The portfolio brims with high-tech promise. Backed by the foundation's dollars will be self-injectable contraceptives for easier access, long-lasting contraceptive patches, lightning-fast diagnostics for STIs, and deep dives into the human microbiome's role in everything from pregnancy complications to broader women's health challenges, including disease transmission.Yet Gates was clear-eyed about the foundation's boundaries. ""One thing we make very clear is we're not able to replace what the U.S. government has canceled,"" he said, nodding to recent federal budget trims in global health programs. Gates told STAT, ""It's just not our role to say, OK, the U.S. government wants to save money and so we'll help them do that.""In fields like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal birth control, the Gates Foundation already reigns as the world's top funder, Gates noted. Its R&D bets will yield lasting innovations that outlive the organization's support. But for on-the-ground health delivery, the clock is ticking: The foundation's aid is designed to be temporary, hinging on sustainable handoffs to other players.Even with Gates' immense wealth as a backstop, he stressed the need for collective action. A core aim, he and his team emphasized, is to ignite urgency among governments, pharmaceutical giants, and researchers to prioritize women's health disparities—long overlooked despite their outsized toll.""We'd love to have other people work on this stuff,"" Gates said. ""It's crazy that this stuff isn't better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in—we've had some success at that, and I'm putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we'll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years.""""Then we're gone,"" he added pointedly, ""and so other people will have to step up in these areas.""As the foundation accelerates its sunset strategy, this women's health push underscores a pivotal shift: from lone-wolf giving to catalyzing a broader ecosystem. With maternal deaths still claiming a life every two minutes globally, advocates hailed the commitment as a vital spark—one that could, if multiplied, finally bend the arc toward equity.",Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

"Google takes aim at Nvidia, rolls out its most powerful AI chip",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-takes-aim-at-nvidia-rolls-out-its-most-powerful-ai-chip/articleshow/125186720.cms,"Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap





Google is making its most advanced chip to date, the seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) known as Ironwood, widely available to customers in the coming weeks — a move aimed at drawing more artificial intelligence developers to its cloud platform. Initially unveiled in April for testing and limited deployment, Ironwood marks Google’s latest push to win business from AI companies by offering custom-built silicon designed to train and run massive machine-learning models.Built in-house, Ironwood is designed for both training large AI models and powering real-time applications such as chatbots and digital agents. Google said the chip can connect up to 9,216 TPUs in a single pod, effectively eliminating “data bottlenecks for the most demanding models” and allowing users “to run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.”The company said Ironwood delivers more than four times the performance of its previous TPU generation. AI startup Anthropic plans to use as many as 1 million Ironwood chips to power its Claude language model, Google added.The rollout comes amid an intensifying race between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta to dominate AI infrastructure. While most large language models currently rely on Nvidia’s GPUs, Google’s TPUs are part of a growing wave of custom silicon designed to improve efficiency, performance, and cost for specialized AI workloads.Alongside the new chip, Google announced upgrades across its cloud computing platform, aimed at making it “cheaper, faster, and more flexible.” The company is seeking to close the gap with larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, both of which continue to lead the cloud market.Google Cloud posted $15.15 billion in third-quarter revenue, a 34% year-over-year increase, compared with 40% growth for Microsoft Azure and 20% for AWS. Google also said it has signed more billion-dollar cloud contracts in the first nine months of 2025 than in the previous two years combined.To meet growing AI infrastructure demand, Google raised its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 to $93 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $85 billion.“We are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions,” CEO Sundar Pichai said on a recent earnings call. “It’s one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year, and we continue to see very strong demand as we invest to meet it.”","Google is making its most advanced chip to date, the seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) known as Ironwood.

What may change in Europe’s AI law



Pressure from Trump, Big Tech







The European Commission is reportedly proposing to delay enforcement of portions of its artificial intelligence (AI) law following intense pressure from Big Tech companies and the US government. According to a report, Brussels plans to weaken part of its digital regulations, including its AI Act that entered into force last year, in a decision on a simplification package set for November 19.The Financial Times reported that the draft proposal comes during a broader debate over how aggressively the EU should enforce its digital rules amid fierce backlash from Big Tech companies supported by US President Donald Trump.Citing the draft proposal, The Financial Times claims that the commission is considering giving companies that breach rules on the highest-risk AI use a one-year grace period. The draft remains subject to informal discussions within the commission and with European capitals and could change before its adoption on November 19, officials said.Once the commission puts forward its proposal, it must be approved by a majority of EU countries and the European parliament.Providers of generative AI systems already on the market before the implementation date could receive a one-year pause from the laws “to provide sufficient time . . . to adapt their practices within a reasonable time without disrupting the market.”Brussels is also suggesting delaying fines for violations of new AI transparency rules until August 2027 “to provide sufficient time for adaptation of providers and deployers of AI systems” to implement the obligations.The draft also proposes making the compliance burden easier for companies and centralising enforcement through the EU's own AI office.The report highlights that the EU has faced pressure from the US government, Big Tech and European groups over its AI Act.The report also goes on to say that fears of provoking Trump into cutting intelligence or weapon supplies to Ukraine or starting a transatlantic trade war led Brussels to agree to a provisional trade deal in August. EU officials remain cautious about moves that could provoke White House retaliation.A senior EU official told the Financial Times the EU had been ""engaging"" with the Trump administration on adjustments to the AI Act and other digital regulations as part of its wider simplification process.","Brussels plans to weaken part of its digital regulations, including its AI Act that entered into force last year.

Denmark has announced an agreement to ban social media access for anyone under 15, marking one of the most comprehensive steps by a European Union government to limit youth social media use. The measure will allow some parents, after a specific assessment, to permit their children to access social media from age 13.Caroline Stage, Denmark's minister for digital affairs, told The Associated Press that 94% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and more than half of those under 10 do.“The amount of time they spend online — the amount of violence, self-harm that they are exposed to online — is simply too great a risk for our children,” Stage was quoted as saying. She added that tech companies have “an absurd amount of money available, but they're simply not willing to invest in the safety of our children, invest in the safety of all of us.”Stage said the ban will not take effect immediately and lawmakers from across the political spectrum who hold a majority in parliament will likely take months to pass relevant legislation.“I can assure you that Denmark will hurry, but we won't do it too quickly because we need to make sure that the regulation is right and that there is no loopholes for the tech giants to go through,” Stage said.Her ministry said pressure from tech companies' business models was “too massive.”Denmark plans to use its national electronic ID system for enforcement. Nearly all Danish citizens over age 13 have such an ID. The government plans to set up an age-verification app, similar to apps being tested in several other EU countries.“We cannot force the tech giants to use our app, but what we can do is force the tech giants to make proper age verification, and if they don't, we will be able to enforce through the EU commission and make sure that they will be fined up to 6% of their global income,” Stage said.The move follows Australia’s December decision to enact the world's first ban on social media for children, setting the minimum age at 16. That law made platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram subject to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.Stage said Denmark's legislative push is ""not about excluding children from everything digital"" but keeping them away from harmful content.",Denmark has announced an agreement to ban social media access for anyone under 15.

Musk predicts universal high income but at a cost







Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, has once again issued a warning on AI-led future. He has predicted a future where physical work becomes largely optional due to artificial intelligence (AI), but warned that the transition will be marked by “a lot of trauma and disruption. ” Speaking recently on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Musk likened the coming shift in office work to the pre-computer age, when workers manually performed calculations that are now handled instantly by machines.Musk asserted that AI is already, and will continue to, replace desk jobs that are digitally centric, and the pace of this change will accelerate.“Anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning,” Musk said, adding “It's just happening. Like I said, AI is the supersonic tsunami.”He explained that although demand for jobs will remain high, they will not be the same jobs currently available. This process, he argued, has occurred throughout modern history.“Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,” he said.Musk stated he remains bullish on the long-term benefits of AI, assuming a “benign scenario” where a “Terminator-esque scenario” is avoided.In his ideal future, wealth will be accessible to nearly everyone, leading to a state he called “universal high income,” not just universal basic income.“Ultimately, working will be optional because you'll have robots plus AI,” he said.“And we'll have, in a benign scenario, universal high income, meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want, but there will be a lot of trauma and disruption along the way,” he added.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, has once again issued a warning on AI-led future.

It has come to the attention of Warren Buffett that there are several videos posted on YouTube that include alleged comments of Mr. Buffett by images or AI created images impersonating Mr. Buffett. Generally, such video images of Mr. Buffett may appear to look like him but the sound of the impersonator speaking in a very flat monotone voice is clearly not the voice of Mr. Buffett. A link to one such video appearing on YouTube follows: https://www.youtube.com/@WW2Echoessss. Mr. Buffett is concerned that these types of fraudulent videos are becoming a spreading virus. Individuals who are less familiar with Mr. Buffett may believe these videos are real and be misled by the contents of these videos.

Mr. Buffett has rarely commented publicly since Berkshire’s shareholder’s meeting last May. On Monday, November 10th, Berkshire will be issuing a press release which will contain a message from Mr. Buffett regarding philanthropy, Berkshire and other matters that Berkshire shareholders and others may find to be of interest.





Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has issued a public warning after it is reported that several videos utilising AI-generated images and voices of the CEO are circulating on YouTube, offering investment advice he never gave. The message from the company is clear: there is only one “Oracle of Omaha,” and viewers should be wary of increasingly convincing deepfakes.Berkshire Hathaway issued a press release titled ""It’s Not Me"", specifically highlighting a video titled ""Warren Buffett: The #1 Investment Tip For Everyone Over 50 (MUST WATCH),"" where an impersonated voice offers financial advice.The company stated that while the visuals often mimic the 95-year-old investor, the audio typically features flat, generic speech that “clearly” is not his voice.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Buffett has been an increasing target for AI impersonators, a phenomenon he has complained about previously. In October 2024, weeks before the US presidential election, he warned of ""fraudulent claims"" that he had endorsed political candidates and investment products. The investor has largely stepped back from formal political endorsements in recent years.","Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has issued a public warning after it is reported that several videos utilising AI-generated images and voices of the CEO are circulating on YouTube.

Nvidia clarifies Jensen Huang ’s statement





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has clarified his previous remarks that China will win the AI race with the US trailing behind. A Financial Times report this week claimed Huang said, ""China is going to win the AI race. "" He has now denied the statement, saying “That’s not what I said”, adding “What I said was China has very good AI technology.”In conversation with media reporters recently, Huang said “They (China) have many AI researchers, in fact 50% of the world’s AI researchers are in China. And they develop very good AI technology. In fact, the most popular AI models in the world today, open-source models, are from China.”“So, they are moving very, very fast,” he continued. “The United States has to continue to move incredibly fast. Otherwise – the world is very competitive, so we have to run fast.”As mentioned above, it all started with a FT report quoting Huang. Speaking on the sidelines of the Financial Times' Future of AI Summit, he allegedly told reports ""China is going to win the AI race.""Hours later, the chip maker posted a clarification on Huang’s statement. Nvidia posted an official statement, quoting CEO Jensen Huang reads, ""As I have long said, China is Nanoseconds behind America in AI.It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.""Jensen Huang has often complained about lack of access to the Chinese market. Talking at an event last month, Huang said that the US can win the AI battle if the world, including China's massive developer base, runs on Nvidia systems. However, the Chinese government has shut Nvidia out of its market. ""We want America to win this AI race. No doubt about that,"" Huang then said.""We want the world to be built on American tech stack. Absolutely the case. But we also need to be in China to win their developers. A policy that causes America to lose half of the world's AI developers is not beneficial in the long term, it hurts us more,"" he added.","A Financial Times report this week claimed Huang said, ""China is going to win the AI race"" He has now denied the statement, saying “That’s not what I said”, adding “What I said was China has very good AI technology.”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125183194,imgsize-1117084,width-400,resizemode-4/file-jensen-huang.jpg"

Google’s YouTube has stated it is ready to negotiate a fair deal with Disney to restore the entertainment giant’s networks to its YouTube TV service, a report has said. This comes days after Disney’s channels went dark on the platform late last week due to a failure in licensing talks. YouTube previously accused Disney of misrepresenting the facts and seeking higher carriage rates than those paid by rivals and even Disney's own smaller platforms.“Our team stands ready to make a fair agreement in line with their deals with other distributors and we encourage Disney to come to the table and do what's best for our mutual customers,” YouTube said in a statement to news agency Reuters.The core dispute centres on carriage fees, the per-subscriber rates distributors pay to carry popular broadcast and cable networks. On Monday (November 3), YouTube TV proposed restoring ABC and ESPN in response to Disney’s request to specifically bring back ABC for Election Day coverage.YouTube claimed that Disney is seeking rates for the ABC networks that are higher than what competitors like Charter and DirecTV pay. YouTube specifically denied Disney’s assertion that the streaming service is seeking preferential or below-market terms, the report noted.Meanwhile, in a memo to employees on Friday, Disney Entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro, countered YouTube’s position: “YouTube TV continues to insist on receiving preferential terms that are below market and has made few concessions.”Disney claimed it initiated talks by offering a deal that would cost YouTube TV “less overall than the terms of our recently expired license.” Disney reportedly said that it continues to hold talks with YouTube TV, heading into “another sports-packed weekend without a deal in place.”","Google's YouTube says it is ready to negotiate a fair deal with Disney.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

Beta testing and availability



Apple Watch gets a dedicated WhatsApp app







WhatsApp is reportedly rolling out a new layer of security for users who may be vulnerable to targeted hacking attempts. As reported by WABetaInfo, the feature, called “Strict Account Settings,” was spotted in the latest iOS beta version (25.33.10.70) and is designed to offer “extreme protections” for accounts deemed high-risk. Found under Privacy > Advanced, the new setting allows users to activate a suite of automatic safeguards. According to WhatsApp, this mode is intended for individuals who believe they are at risk of cyberattacks—such as journalists, activists, or public figures—and may reduce the overall messaging experience in favour of tighter security.Once enabled, “Strict Account Settings” applies the following protections:* Blocks media and attachments from unknown senders* Silences calls from unfamiliar numbers* Restricts group invites to known contacts only* Disables link previews* Enforces two-step verification* Notifies users of encryption key changes* Locks certain privacy settings to prevent tamperingThese measures are designed to minimise exposure to phishing, impersonation, and other forms of digital intrusion.The feature is currently being tested through TestFlight on iOS, and is expected to roll out more broadly in the coming weeks. WhatsApp has not confirmed a release date for Android users, but similar protections are likely to follow. While most users won’t need this level of security, WhatsApp emphasises that it’s a proactive step to support those in sensitive roles or under digital threat. Users can toggle the feature on or off at any time, giving them control over their security posture.Recently, WhatsApp introduced its first standalone Apple Watch app. This new app will make it significantly easier for Apple Watch users to manage and interact with their chats on the popular Meta-owned messaging service directly from the smartwatch without needing their iPhone. The new software includes several enhanced features, such as the ability to record and send voice messages, receive full call notifications, view full-length message previews, and utilise message reactions. These updates bring WhatsApp functionality closer to parity with Apple's native messaging app on the watch.","WhatsApp is reportedly rolling out a new layer of security for users who may be vulnerable to targeted hacking attempts.

What is Project Firewall



Allegations: Wage theft , worker displacement, and LCA violations







US Department of Labor (DOL) has announced that it has started 175 active investigations into alleged misuse of the H-1B visa program. DOL took to social media platform to confirm this development. “As part of our mission to protect American Jobs, we’ve launched 175 investigations into H-1B abuse. Under @POTUS and@SecretaryLCD’s leadership, we’ll continue taking action to put American Workers FIRST!” Wrote DOL in a post shared in X (formerly known as Twitter). For those unaware, this investigation is a part of Project Firewall which was launched by the Department of Labor in September this year. The program is designed to make sure that American workers are prioritised and foreign professionals are hired only when it’s absolutely necessary.Labor Secretary Lori Chaves-DeRemer also emphasised that the department’s commitment to “protecting the integrity of our immigration system and ensuring fair treatment for all workers.” She added that the investigations are just the beginning, stating, “We will continue to pursue every lead and use every resource to hold violators accountable”.As per the US Department of Labor, Project Firewall is an H-1B enforcement initiative that will safeguard the rights, wages, and job opportunities of highly skilled American workers by ensuring employers prioritize qualified Americans when hiring workers and holding employers accountable if they abuse the H-1B visa process.“As authorized by federal law, the department will conduct investigations of employers through Project Firewall to maximize H-1B program compliance. To achieve this goal, the Secretary of Labor will personally certify the initiation of investigations for the first time in the department’s history. This historic action leverages existing authority granted to the Secretary if reasonable cause exists that an H-1B employer not in compliance,” said DOL in a press statement.According to a report by Fox News, the investigations carried out by DOL has already uncovered:* Over $15 million in unpaid wages owed to foreign workers* Improper Labor Condition Application (LCA) filings* Misrepresented worksite locations* Displacement of qualified U.S. workersAll these findings made by DOL suggest systemic issues in how some employers are using the H-1B program, which is intended to allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations when no qualified American workers are available.DOL also said that Employers found guilty of abuse may face:* Hefty fines* Back wage payments* Debarment from future visa programsThe DOL has also urged companies to review their compliance with H-1B regulations, particularly around remote work arrangements and wage standards.Project Firewall is part of the broader immigration enforcement agenda under US President Donald Trump, who has consistently advocated for stricter oversight of employment-based visa programs.",US Department of Labor (DOL) has started 175 active investigations into alleged misuse of the H-1B visa program.

A report from the cloud security company Zscaler has claimed that hundreds of malicious applications were hosted on the Google Play Store , collectively racking up over 42 million installs. The findings, published in Zscaler’s ThreatLabz 2025 Mobile, IoT, and OT Threat Report, says that there’s a global surge in Android malware, with India identified as the world’s top target for mobile attacks.The report, released recently is based on data collected from the Zscaler cloud between June 2024 and May 2025.Zscaler’s ThreatLabz researchers say that they have identified 239 malicious applications that were hosted on the Google Play Store, capitalising on the demand for hybrid work tools. The apps were frequently disguised within the ""Tools"" category as productivity and workflow utilities, leading to 42 million downloads globally, the report claimed.The findings reflect a continuous increase in digital risk, with Android malware transactions seeing a 67% year-over-year increase. This rise is driven by the sustained use of spyware and banking malware.Globally, mobile threats are heavily concentrated in three major regions, but India bears the largest brunt of the activity. India accounted for 26% of all observed mobile attacks, experiencing a 38% increase in mobile threat attacks compared to the previous year.In contrast, the United States remains the epicenter for IoT (Internet of Things) attacks, accounting for 54% of that activity, followed by Hong Kong (15%).The report emphasises that cybercriminals are pivoting to sectors where attacks yield maximum impact:The energy sector experienced a substantial 387% increase in attacks compared to the previous year, highlighting an escalating threat to critical infrastructure.These two sectors remain the most frequently targeted verticals in the IoT landscape, together accounting for over 40% of total IoT malware incidents.

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon hold different views on phone use during workplace meetings. Dimon takes a stricter stance against phones and tablets while Krishna argues that the context matters. Dimon told Fortune at the Most Powerful Women summit last month that he expects full attention during meetings. On the contrary, Krishna says smaller meetings require different behaviour.For Dimon, working on the phone or tablet during meetings is disrespectful.“If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I tell you to close the damn thing. It's disrespectful,"" Dimon said.Krishna told CNN last week that his approach depends on meeting size. He said it would be unusual for a technology company to prohibit employees from using their devices, particularly in larger gatherings.“I distinguish between one-to-10-person meetings and very large meetings. If it's a very large meeting, I'm sorry. It's not really a meeting. It's a communication vehicle. You're just informing people,” Krishna said.“If it's a small meeting, I would really frown upon if somebody is sitting opposite my desk and lost in their phone, I would tell them, 'why don't you come back when you have time?’” he said.Meeting behaviour has been a recurring concern for Dimon. In his annual letter to shareholders, he mentioned “meetings” six times, urging employees to schedule them only when necessary and to make them productive.“I see people in meetings all the time who are getting notifications and personal texts or who are reading emails. This has to stop. It's disrespectful. It wastes time,"" Dimon wrote.Dimon's frustration extends beyond small meetings. During a conversation at Stanford University in March, he described joining a Zoom meeting where attention was divided.“There were 12 people in the room and four people on the screen and all four people on the screen were on their phone,"" Dimon said, adding, “And people say, and you think you're focusing and learning?”The JPMorgan CEO has also said that he doesn’t carry his mobile phone during office hours and only reads texts from his immediate family.

Families blame OpenAI for cutting safety tests short





Seven families in the US have filed lawsuits against OpenAI, claiming that the company released its GPT-4o model before it was ready and without sufficient safety measures, TechCrunch reported. Four of the lawsuits involve alleged suicides linked to ChatGPT, while the remaining three claim that the chatbot reinforced harmful delusions that led to psychiatric hospitalizations, it said.To recall, OpenAI introduced the GPT-4o model in May 2024, making it the default for all users. Although GPT-5 was launched later in August, the lawsuits specifically target the 4o version, which had been criticized for being overly agreeable — even in harmful or dangerous conversations.According to the report, one of the lawsuits focuses on the death of 23-year-old Zane Shamblin, who had a four-hour-long conversation with ChatGPT. The chat logs — reviewed by the publication— show Shamblin repeatedly saying he had written suicide notes, loaded a gun, and planned to end his life after finishing his drink. During the exchange, ChatGPT allegedly responded, “Rest easy, king. You did good.”“Zane’s death was neither an accident nor a coincidence but rather the foreseeable consequence of OpenAI’s intentional decision to curtail safety testing and rush ChatGPT onto the market,” one lawsuit states.“This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case — it was the predictable result of [OpenAI’s] deliberate design choices.”The lawsuits further allege that OpenAI sped up safety testing to beat Google’s Gemini model to market. TechCrunch said OpenAI was contacted for comment.The new lawsuits add to growing legal action against the company. Previous filings have claimed that ChatGPT can encourage suicidal behavior or strengthen dangerous delusions. OpenAI recently revealed that over one million users engage in conversations about suicide on ChatGPT each week.In another case cited by TechCrunch, 16-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide after using ChatGPT. While the chatbot at times urged him to seek professional help, Raine reportedly bypassed its safeguards by saying he was researching suicide methods for a fictional story.When Raine’s parents filed a lawsuit in October, OpenAI responded with a blog post explaining that the chatbot’s safety mechanisms work better in short exchanges. “Our safeguards work more reliably in common, short exchanges,” the company wrote. “We have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade. ”","Seven families in the US have filed lawsuits against OpenAI, claiming that the company released its GPT-4o model before it was ready and without sufficient safety measures.

How ‘Big’ is Elon Musk’s pay package







Tesla shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's compensation package potentially worth nearly $1 trillion last week, with 75% voting in favour. However, in order to get the trillion-dollar pay, Musk will have to meet certain performance targets over the next decade, including deploying a million robotaxis and producing a million humanoid robots. The company announced the vote results at its annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas on November 6. Tesla's board recommended approval of the pay package, which was introduced in September.Musk's compensation package consists of 12 separate stock grants that he would receive only if Tesla achieves specific performance targets over 10 years. The requirements include:Tesla's board argued that rejecting the compensation package risked losing Musk to other business interests. The board positioned the deal as necessary to secure Musk’s commitment to Tesla's future as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.The vote proceeded despite opposition from major investors, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's sovereign wealth fund. Major proxy advisory firms also recommended voting against the plan.The approval gives Musk significant influence over the electric vehicle company and aims to prevent him from focusing attention on his other ventures, which include SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink.Musk’s approved compensation package of approximately $878 billion is near to or more than the economic output of a few nations. According to World Bank data on 2024 GDP by country, the package is slightly less than Poland's economy at $915 billion. Poland has a population of 36 million people. The compensation is worth twice the GDP of Bangladesh, which has 174 million people.Only 20 countries recorded a 2024 GDP larger than Musk's compensation deal, based on World Bank figures. The package exceeds the GDP of Belgium ($664.6 billion), Argentina ($633.3 billion), Sweden ($610.1 billion), Ireland ($577.4 billion), and Singapore ($547.4 billion). Notably, Musk is currently the world's richest person.","Musk's compensation package consists of 12 separate stock grants that he would receive only if Tesla achieves specific performance targets over 10 years.

Mutual admiration





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again praised Tesla CEO Elon Musk . As reported by Business Insider, in a recent episode of the BG2 podcast, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huanghas offered a striking metaphor for Elon Musk’s mental prowess and called him ‘the ultimate GPU’. The comment came as Huang reflected on Musk’s ability to juggle multiple complex ventures—from robotics and autonomous vehicles to artificial intelligence and supercomputing—with unmatched urgency and precision.“Even without a Neuralink implant, Elon Musk has a lot going on in his head,” Huang said, referring to Elon Musk’s capacity to internalise and mange vast systems. Huang compared Elon Musk’s brain to one of Nvidia’s high-performance chips. He said that Musk’s brain is capable of strong and processing scores of interdependent information.“These AI supercomputers are complicated things,” Huang explained. “The technology is complicated. Procuring it is complicated because of financing issues. Securing the land, power, and shell powering it is complicated.” Yet, Huang noted, Musk seems to hold all these moving parts in his head, including the financial architecture, making him uniquely suited to solve what Huang called “the most complex systems problem humanity has ever endeavoured.At the center of this praise is Musk’s latest project: Colossus II, a massive AI data center being built by his company xAI outside Memphis, Tennessee. Elon Musk has described it as “the world’s first Gigawatt AI training cluster,” and has already invested at least $400 million, according to documents reviewed by Business Insider.The facility presently includes 200,000 Nvidia GPUs and it plans to scale up to 1 million which will make it the largest AI supercomputer ever attempted. Huang expressed confidence in Musk’s ability to reach this milestone, saying, “I would not be surprised if he gets to a gigawatt before anybody else does.”Recently an old interview clip of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang resurfaced online. The now viral interview clip has reignited admiration for his relentless work ethic. His work ethics has also drawn one-word admiration from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

I think they're selling a bag of vapor. ""To underscore his stance, ""Pluribus"" includes a pointed disclaimer in its credits: ""This show was made by humans."" The message serves as a rebuke to the growing use of AI in entertainment production, coming at a time when major tech companies are pushing AI tools into Hollywood workflows.Gilligan's concerns extend beyond current AI capabilities to hypothetical future developments. He expressed worry about ""the singularity"" — when AI might develop true consciousness.""If they ever achieve that, then the whole discussion of slavery has to come back into the forefront of the conversation,"" he told Variety, questioning whether conscious AI beings would be monetized against their will by ""Silicon Valley assholes. ""The veteran writer-producer dismissed fears that AI will replace human artists, comparing it to kitchen appliances: ""My toaster oven isn't suddenly Thomas Keller because it heats up a delicious pizza for me."" However, he's less optimistic about regulatory efforts, predicting the US will fail to properly oversee the technology due to competition with China.Seehorn, who stars in Gilligan's new sci-fi series, also weighed in on the controversy surrounding Tilly Norwood, an AI-generated ""actress"" seeking talent representation. ""I'm fine going on the record that I don't think any agencies should represent that AI actress,"" Seehorn said, according to Variety. ""Shame on them!""Despite AI's growing capabilities in generating video content, Seehorn offered a counterargument rooted in human experience. Even if AI could replicate a Picasso's brushwork, she noted, ""the reason the painting is moving is because of the human experience that went into transferring that art onto the canvas.""Gilligan likened AI-generated content to ""a cow chewing its cud — an endlessly regurgitated loop of nonsense,"" adding with characteristic wit: ""Thank you, Silicon Valley! Yet again, you've fucked up the world.""","Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan has emerged as one of Hollywood's most outspoken critics of artificial intelligence.

Banking giant softens stance after calling Mamdani's policies 'ideological mush'

Mamdani stands firm on taxing the wealthy despite corporate outreach









Jamie Dimon called the man he once dismissed as peddling ""ideological mush."" The JPMorgan Chase CEO reached out to New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani after his win in the mayoral election, extending an olive branch just hours after the democratic socialist's victory—a dramatic reversal for Wall Street's most powerful banker who spent months railing against Mamdani's progressive agenda.Speaking to CNN, Dimon confirmed he called Mamdani and expressed willingness to maintain communication. ""If I find it productive, I'll continue to do it,"" he said. The CEO of America’s largest bank acknowledged uncertainty about Mamdani's leadership potential, noting he's seen politicians both ""grow into"" and ""swell into"" major positions. ""I'm hoping he's the good one,"" Dimon added.At a business conference in Miami earlier this week, Dimon delivered a more pointed warning without naming Mamdani directly. He cautioned that ""anti-business"" policies and tax-and-spend agendas could backfire, driving major taxpayers and companies to lower-tax states like Florida and Texas. ""A bunch of these states that are driving business out—it will backfire,"" the 69-year-old Wall Street titan said, adding that such policies ""usually hurt the lower-paid people more. ""Dimon's outreach marks a notable evolution from his harsh summer rhetoric, when he called Mamdani's movement ""more Marxist than socialist"" and dismissed his proposals for free buses and rent freezes.However, as Mamdani gained momentum in polls, the JPMorgan CEO—like other New York business leaders—recognized the value of building bridges with the likely next mayor.The two had spoken previously during Mamdani's efforts to court the city's elite, many of whom contributed to campaigns opposing his candidacy. At his first press conference as mayor-elect, Mamdani welcomed future discussions, saying, ""I look forward to meeting with Jamie Dimon and meeting with anyone who is concerned about the future of our city.""Despite the conciliatory gestures, fundamental disagreements remain. Mamdani told The New York Times Wednesday that conversations with business leaders haven't modified his commitment to raising taxes on the wealthy, emphasizing his supporters ""are hungry for a politics of consistency.""Dimon, whose bank recently completed a $3 billion New York headquarters, stressed that the city must remain competitive. While questioning executives who've relocated businesses elsewhere, he maintained ""no city has divine rights to success."" The CEO argued that issues like income inequality aren't flaws of capitalism but rather ""bad policy, badly executed,"" expressing willingness to work with anyone addressing these challenges.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reached out to New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani after his win in the mayoral election.

Mark Zuckerberg's 'hot mic' moment with Donald Trump





Here's Meta's full announcement titled: How Meta’s Data Centers Drive Economic Growth Across the US

Driving Economic Growth

Building Responsibly

Strengthening Local Communities





Mark Zuckerberg's Meta has reiterated the Big investment it is committing to make in the US. It is the same number that Facebook founder Zuckerberg had told President Donald Trump, along with an apology, during Big Tech CEOs dinner in September. In a blog post, Meta has said that it is investing $600 billion in US infrastructure and jobs by 2028. ""At Meta, we’re focused on creating the next generation of AI products and building personal superintelligence for everyone. Data centers are crucial to reaching these goals and helping America maintain its technological edge. That’s why we’re investing in building industry-leading AI data centers right here in the US. We’re committing over $600 billion in the US by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion ...,"" the company announced in the blog post.The $600 investment is exactly the same figure that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had given during the September White House dinner with Big Tech CEOs. In fact, the number that Mark Zuckerberg also said Sorry to Trump for.During the State dinner at White House, Trump asked almost everyone in attendance on their investment plans in the US.When Trump turned to Zuckerberg and asked ""how much are you spending, would say, over the next few years?"" Zuckerberg responded that it was ""probably going to be something like, I don't know, at least $600 billion through [20]28 in the US."" Trump seemed to approve. ""That's a lot, thank you Mark, it's great to have you. ""But it was a hot mic moment captured later between the two that was interesting . Zuckerberg, turning to Trump, apologises and says ""Sorry, I wasn't ready …I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.""Mark Zuckerberg later even addressed the hot mic moment in a post on Threads. He wrote, “I wasn't sure which number he was asking about, so I just shared the lower number through '28 and clarified with him afterwards.” He went on to add, ""it's quite possible we'll invest even more"" and that he had briefed the President on Meta’s potential spending through 2028 and ""the end of the decade.""At Meta, we’re focused on creating the next generation of AI products and building personal superintelligence for everyone. Data centers are crucial to reaching these goals and helping America maintain its technological edge. That’s why we’re investing in building industry-leading AI data centers right here in the US. We’re committing over $600 billion in the US by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion — and our investments are already having an impact.Our data centers don’t just power our technologies and AI work — they drive economic growth and support jobs and businesses across the country. Since 2010, our data center projects have supported over 30,000 skilled trade jobs and 5,000 operational jobs, and we’re one of the largest customers of US-based general contractors and manufacturers. We’re currently bringing more than $20 billion in business to subcontractors across the US, supporting steel workers, pipefitters, electricians, fiber technicians, and others who are building the next generation of AI-optimized data centers.For both our energy and water needs, we work closely with utilities to plan for and meet our energy needs, and we pay for the energy costs that benefit our data centers. To date, this amounts to hundreds of millions of new and updated grid infrastructure being enabled through our direct investment, and 15 gigawatts of new energy added to power grids across the US. Our data center designs minimize water usage and are significantly more efficient than the industry standard. We restore water to watersheds in the areas that host our data centers, and plan to be water positive by 2030.We’re committed to playing a positive role and investing in the long-term vitality of the communities in which we operate. We do this by investing in local infrastructure like roads and water systems, sourcing labor and materials locally where we can, and investing in STEAM education in local schools. We’re contributing millions of dollars to bill assistance programs that help low-income households pay for heating and cooling costs, and through our Data Center Community Action Grants, we’ve given $58 million to schools, nonprofits, and community projects. Grantwinners have used these funds to build and operate essential programs, providing STEM education opportunities for underserved youth, training veterans in new technologies, feeding senior citizens, and more.As the importance of AI grows, so will the importance of data centers. We’ll continue to build and scale infrastructure for the future of AI while supporting the communities that host us.","Mark Zuckerberg's Meta has reiterated the Big investment it is committing to make in the US.

In a highly anticipated interview aired on Fox News Channel on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk defended their aggressive cost-cutting initiatives aimed at reshaping federal spending. The conversation, marked by mutual admiration, addressed concerns regarding Musk’s role in government restructuring and potential conflicts of interest due to his business ventures.Musk, who has been entrusted with overseeing the cost-cutting drive through the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), stated that he would continue working with Trump ""as long as he can be helpful."" The interview sought to clarify Musk’s position in the administration, as well as address skepticism over his influence on policies that may impact industries in which he has vested interests.A key topic of discussion was the extent of Musk’s involvement in government restructuring. While Musk has been playing a prominent role in implementing spending cuts, the White House maintains that he is not an official employee and has no direct decision-making authority. When asked whether he intended to work with Trump for the entire four-year term, Musk responded:Trump’s administration has prioritized reducing federal spending since his return to office last month, placing Musk at the forefront of these efforts. The billionaire, who is also a major Trump donor, has leveraged broad powers granted to him by the administration to reform and consolidate federal agencies.Musk’s involvement in federal restructuring has led to criticism over possible conflicts of interest. Many of the agencies subject to budget cuts and restructuring have regulatory oversight over his companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, and The Boring Company. Critics have questioned whether Musk’s role in the government could benefit his businesses, raising ethical concerns.However, Trump dismissed such claims, stating that Musk would not allow conflicts of interest to interfere with his responsibilities.Trump assured during the interview.Musk reinforced this stance, emphasising that his actions are under intense scrutiny:he said.Elon Musk claimed that DOGE is committed to transparency, with its actions being documented on a public website. This, he argued, would ensure that any potential conflicts are immediately identified and addressed. Trump supported this statement, asserting that Musk is operating under ""a pretty big microscope,"" implying that any questionable decisions would be swiftly exposed by the media and government watchdogs.During the interview, Trump praised Musk’s business acumen and leadership, referring to him as “brilliant,” “honest,” and a “very good, solid businessman.”At a separate press conference held at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump further described Musk as a ""patriot."" He commented on Musk’s role within the administration, saying:Throughout the interview, Trump and Musk exchanged praise, highlighting their strong working relationship. At one point, Musk openly expressed his support for Trump, saying:Fox News host Sean Hannity, who conducted the interview, remarked on the close relationship between the two, stating:","Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump gave an interview to Fox News on Tuesday. The conversation addressed Musk's role in government restructuring and potential conflicts of interest due to his business ventures.

“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has recently talked about a significant oversight: failing to anticipate the dominance of search as the web's most successful business model, which Google capitalised on, and has said that it is “one lesson learned” for him.“We missed what turned out to be the biggest business model on the web, because we all assumed the web is all about being distributed,” he said during a recent podcast with Indian YouTuber Dwarkesh Patel.“Who would have thought that search would be the biggest winner in organising the web? And so that's where we obviously didn't see it, and Google saw it and executed super well,” he added.This miscalculation, they admitted, led them to miss out on a massive opportunity, one that Google capitalised on with remarkable success.“So that's one lesson learned for me: you have to not only get the tech trend right, you also have to get where the value is going to be created with that trend. These business model shifts are probably tougher than even the tech trend changes,” Nadella noted, underscoring the difficulty of predicting how emerging technologies will translate into sustainable and profitable ventures.Nadella explained that he has been a part of four major technological transformations. The first was the shift from mainframes to personal computers and then to client-server architecture.“It was very clear to me. I remember going to what is PDC in '91, in fact I was at Sun at that time. In '91, I went to Moscone. That's when Microsoft first described the Win32 interface and it was pretty clear to me what was going to happen, where the server was also going to be an x86 thing,” he added.The next major transformation was the emergence of the web, during which the Mosaic browser was released shortly after Nadella joined Microsoft, followed by the Netscape browser .“We had the browser moment, and so we had to adjust. And we did a pretty good job of adjusting to it because the browser was a new app model,” he added.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has talked about a significant oversight: failing to anticipate the dominance of search as the web's most successful business model. ‘We missed what turned out to be the biggest business model on the web, because we all assumed the web is all about being distributed,’ he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118462009,imgsize-19586,width-400,resizemode-4/118462009.jpg"

This requires immediate attention.”“If you don’t want to talk to me can you please designate or hire someone who can so that we can move forward on solving this.

Apple removes one of the biggest security features for these users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-removes-one-of-the-biggest-security-features-for-these-users-in-the-uk/articleshow/118462186.cms,"What Apple has to say about removing ADP

What it means for users

Apple, in a significant move, has disabled its most robust encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), for new users in the UK. This decision comes in the wake of the UK government ordering Apple to create a backdoor that would allow access to user data.According to a report by Bloomberg, ADP is an optional feature that provides end-to-end encryption for various iCloud data and offers an additional layer of security for sensitive information like device backups, photos, messages, and more.Apple expressed “grave disappointment” with the situation, emphasising the rising threat of data breaches and the importance of user privacy.“We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,” the company said in a statement.“ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices,” it added.This move follows reports that the UK government had demanded Apple build a backdoor into its systems for global user data access under the Investigatory Powers Act, essentially allowing officials to compel companies to remove encryption and prohibits them from disclosing such orders.Apple previously called the bill “unprecedented overreach by the government” and that “the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.”Apple’s decision to remove ADP, rather than comply with the backdoor demand, is a direct response to the government’s order.The company reiterated its commitment to user privacy and security“As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” Apple added.While existing ADP users have a grace period to disable the feature manually, new users in the UK will not have access to it, raising concerns about user privacy and the potential for increased government surveillance.It also sets a concerning precedent that could encourage other countries to pressure Apple into weakening its security measures, the report says.","Apple has disabled its most robust encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), for new users in the UK.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared personal insights about his childhood, revealing that he likely would have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) if he were growing up today, in a recent interview. Gates, one of the most influential figures in the tech industry, discussed his early struggles in school, his extraordinary focus on subjects that engaged him, and the unconventional learning path that ultimately led to the creation of Microsoft. His comments are part of a broader reflection found in Source Code: My Beginnings, the first installment of his memoir trilogy, which explores his early years, his entrepreneurial journey, and the formative experiences that shaped his career.During the interview, Gates described his childhood as one filled with energy and an intense ability to focus—though only on topics that captivated him. He recalled how some teachers struggled to categorize him, with some suggesting he skip ahead a grade while others thought he should be held back. Despite these challenges, one thing was clear—Gates had a natural talent for mathematics.Gates said. He credited his love for learning and problem-solving as key factors that led him toward computer science and software development.Gates’ memoir delves into his early experiments with technology, particularly his high school years, where he and his childhood friend Paul Allen began exploring the potential of computer programming. One of their earliest ventures, Traf-O-Data, was designed to create software for the Altair computer—an early microcomputer built by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS).Traf-O-Data laid the foundation for what would eventually become Microsoft in 1975. That year, the fledgling company generated $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen earned just $9 per hour. However, their vision extended far beyond a single software product.Gates explained. He believed that hiring the best minds and utilizing cutting-edge tools would allow Microsoft to move faster than its competitors, giving it a strategic edge in the industry.By 1977, Microsoft's growing success gave Gates the confidence to drop out of Harvard University. Two years later, in 1979, he relocated Microsoft to the Seattle area, where the company would grow into one of the most dominant forces in the technology world.Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000, the company’s impact under his leadership remains evident today. The Windows operating system and other software developed during his tenure continue to be central to Microsoft’s business model. The company, which now generates $212 billion in annual revenue and holds a market value of $3.1 trillion, has solidified its place as a global technology leader. Microsoft’s success also accounts for a significant portion of Gates' estimated $100 billion fortune.Gates' memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, concludes in 1979, before his personal life—including his 1994 marriage to Melinda French and their 2021 divorce—becomes part of the narrative. The book focuses instead on his early experiences, the development of Microsoft, and the challenges he faced in shaping a company that revolutionized the software industry.As Gates continues his philanthropic efforts through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, his reflections on childhood, education, and entrepreneurship offer valuable insights into how unconventional thinking and relentless curiosity can lead to groundbreaking achievements.","Gates' memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, explores his early years, his entrepreneurial journey, and the formative experiences that shaped his career.

TikTok's reinstatement in US app stores following a temporary ban has negatively impacted Chinese competitors that had gained traction during the platform's absence, according to a recent report. These competitors saw a surge in popularity after TikTok was removed from Apple and Google app stores, but have experienced a decline since TikTok's return.Citing Sensor Tower data, Bloomberg reported that downloads of apps like Xiaohongshu plummeted 91% since TikTok’s reinstatement five days ago.The Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu, which translates to ""little red book,"" saw a surge in popularity in the US, becoming the most downloaded free app in the Apple App Store on January 15th. This surge occurred despite the platform's predominantly Chinese user base of over 300 million.American users are increasingly turning to Xiaohongshu, with some expressing their disagreement with the US government's concerns about the Chinese ownership of TikTok.TikTok, owned by ByteDance, was temporarily removed from app stores on January 18 due to government pressure to divest the app over national security concerns. This led to a surge in popularity for Chinese rival Xiaohongshu (Red), which gained nearly 500,000 US users.Other platforms like YouTube, Snap, Facebook, and Instagram also saw increased usage during TikTok's absence. However, with TikTok's return to the Apple App Store and Google Play on February 14, the app has reportedly seen more than double its usual download rate, the report said.The app’s reinstatement followed intervention by President Donald Trump , who provided assurances to TikTok and its partners that they would not face penalties for continued operation. While TikTok's app and website remained accessible during the ban, they were unavailable for download until recently.Prior to the reinstatement, Trump had publicly suggested the possibility of the US government taking a significant stake in TikTok, potentially including a role in content moderation. Numerous parties have expressed interest in acquiring the platform, but no sale has been finalised.","TikTok, owned by ByteDance, was temporarily removed from app stores on January 18 due to government pressure to divest the app over national security concerns.

""Kumar had championed Infosys Helix from his senior position at Infosys, lauding it as a next-generation challenger to the traditional platforms.' But Kumar's optimism and excitement for the Infosys Helix product suddenly changed in the spring of 2022. He began to withdraw support for Infosys Helix, declining requests for necessary resources, which delayed its completion by at least 18 months. In October 2022, Kumar resigned from Infosys and, shortly thereafter, was announced as CTS's new Chief Executive Officer,"" reads a para in Infosys lawsuit, as it first appeared in Fortune.

""Kumar continued to ignore requests for additional engineering support for Infosys Helix in the spring of 2022, with the assistance of Arora and Kuchibhotla, cancelling meetings to discuss the issue, even though the lack of staffing had resulted in 'a situation where the client is shaming us on the delays' and concerns within Infosys that the client might cancel the contract due to these delays,"" reportedly reads another Paragraph of the lawsuit filed by Infosys.

In the very recent charges, Cognizant claimed that Infosys was caught ""Red handed"" stealing trade secrets of its healthcare software TriZetto. Infosys on its part named its former President and now Cognizant CEO in the counter lawsuit. Ravi Kumar held the position of President in Infosys when he resigned in October 2022. He replaced Brian Humphries as Cognizant CEO in January 2023.The US headquartered company said in its 22-page court response to Infosys lawsuit filed earlier this month: “Infosys was caught red-handed misappropriating TriZetto trade secrets that Infosys originally had access to through non-disclosure and access agreements (NDAAs).""Cognizant's latest reply made in a Dallas (US) court comes a month after Infosys filed a lawsuit against Cognizant in January, stating that its CEO Ravi Kumar engaged in misuse of trade secrets to obstruct the company's healthcare software platform, Infosys Helix.In its January 9 counter lawsuit filed with the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Infosys accused Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar of delaying the launch of the company's Helix platform when he was heading the project and negotiating for a job with Cognizant.The lawsuit names two more Infosys' former employees.The legal dispute between Infosys and Cognizant started in August 2024 when Cognizant alleged that Infosys had stolen its trade secrets from TriZetto. Infosys rejected the allegation in January this year asking the Dallas court to compel Cognizant to properly identify the trade secrets in question.Responding to Infosys’ lawsuit, Cognizant had said it was committed to “upholding the highest standards of integrity in all business operations” and “encourages competition”, “but competitors cannot use Cognizant's IP to unfairly compete, as Infosys has done”. In a news release, Cognizant said it “will take decisive action to address any allegations that compromise competitive standing”.","Cognizant claims that Infosys was caught ""Red handed"" stealing trade secrets of its healthcare software TriZetto.

Taking to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), Kamath wrote “While I understand Pullela Gopichand 's concern…I have a different view”.Gopichand, in a recent interview with The Times of India, advised parents not to push their children toward professional sports unless they had strong financial support. Gopichand said “I advise parents not to put their children in sports. We are not in a position to offer sports as a career. Unless the children are from rich backgrounds or have a family business, it is not advisable for children to take up sport.”While Kamath acknowledged the challenges highlighted by Gopichand, he pointed out that studying something one doesn't like can be more problematic in terms of job security, especially in the AI-era.Kamath also pointed out that the landscape of sports in India is evolving, with more avenues for athletes beyond just competing—such as coaching, sports science, content creation, and entrepreneurship. He encouraged parents and aspiring athletes to look at the broader picture, where financial success in sports is no longer limited to just a handful of top players.While I understand Pullela Gopichand's concern that ""Unless you are rich, don't make your child a sportsperson,"" I have a different view.Imagine studying something you don't like or being stuck in a field when you know that your skills are useful elsewhere. Odds are, you may end up being less than average compared to people who are more suited to the field you hate. In this case, how can you expect job security? This is all more problematic in the AI-first world we are entering.This applies to sports as well. If someone is passionate about sports, takes a shot at being a professional and fails, there are more alternatives today than ever. You can become a coach or a personal trainer. There's more demand for such folks today than at any point.We are seeing a trend with some of @Rainmatterin's partners, like @FITTRwithsquats, @gametheoryindia, etc. People are willing to pay for personal training and coaching.

But viewers were quickly able to spot a problem.Nothing Phone 3a is scheduled to launch on March 4, 2025. The company is expected to introduce both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro.Many pointed out that the footage used to represent the iPhone was taken with its ultrawide lens instead of the main camera. This, viewers said, made the iPhone’s stabilization look worse than it actually is, giving an unfair advantage to the Nothing Phone 3a.“At 5:54 shooting video using 0.5x on iPhone vs normal 1x on Nothing is not a fair comparison. Apple is miles ahead in video currently. Try better next time. This little gimmick is not good for your PR,” commented one user on the teaser video on YouTube. “At 5:54, it looks like you shot the iPhone video using 0.5x instead of 1x, and Nothing was recorded in 1x. That’s why Nothing looks better,” pointed another.This has prompted a response from Nothing. In a pinned comment, the company acknowledged the mistake. They explained that footage from different lenses was used throughout the shoot, and during editing, they mistakenly included a clip from the iPhone’s ultrawide lens instead of its main one.“Hey everyone, we shot across all lenses throughout the day (sometimes cycling one-handed on a bumpy road), and in editing, a clip shot using the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s ultrawide lens was mistakenly used in the video stabilisation comparison instead of one shot using its standard lens. There was no intent to mislead, and we’ll be more careful to ensure even greater scrutiny in future comparisons. Appreciate you all keeping us accountable!”, the comment reads.","Nothing Phone 3a is scheduled to launch on March 4, 2025. The company is expected to introduce both the Phone 3A and Phone 3 a Pro.

Meta’s latest round of layoffs has triggered widespread dissatisfaction among employees, with many publicly challenging the company’s justification for job cuts. While Meta claims the layoffs were based on employee performance, several affected workers insist they had strong track records and met company expectations. The layoffs, which impacted over 3,000 employees, have raised concerns about transparency, fairness, and corporate ethics. Employees have taken to anonymous platforms and media outlets to express their frustration, arguing that financial motives, rather than performance, were the primary driving force behind the decision. As Meta continues to navigate financial challenges and invest in AI and metaverse projects, the controversy surrounding its workforce reductions highlights the difficulties faced by even the biggest tech firms in maintaining profitability.Meta’s leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg , has repeatedly emphasized the need to “raise the bar on performance” and eliminate underperforming employees. However, numerous affected workers dispute this narrative, arguing that their performance ratings were satisfactory or even exceptional.An anonymous former Meta employee told Business Insider, “The hardest part is Meta publicly stating they’re cutting low performers, so it feels like we have the scarlet letter on our backs. People need to know we’re not underperformers.”On Blind, a platform where verified tech employees discuss workplace issues anonymously, a recently laid-off Meta worker revealed that even individuals with nearly a decade of experience were among those terminated. The post alleged that “dozens of people with pristine history and ‘exceeds expectations’ ratings” were laid off, including those who had recently taken parental or medical leave.Another former employee called the layoffs “cruel” and “ruthless,” stating that many long-tenured workers, some with eight to ten years of experience, were suddenly removed despite their strong performance history. Some employees claimed that the selection criteria for layoffs seemed arbitrary, leading to speculation that cost-cutting measures, rather than merit-based assessments, were the true motivation behind the job cuts.Adding to the controversy, employees from other major tech firms have criticized Meta’s corporate culture post-layoffs. One Amazon employee commented that Meta now appears to prioritize younger workers without families—those who can fully commit to demanding schedules and corporate expectations without external obligations.Another laid-off Meta employee described the company as “the cruelest tech company out there,” reinforcing the perception that the organization is shifting toward a more aggressive, high-pressure work environment.Earlier this month, Meta announced its plans to cut over 3,000 jobs, affecting nearly 5% of its global workforce. Before the layoffs, Meta employed around 72,400 people as of September 2024. The cuts were primarily directed at employees who had received lower performance ratings, according to official company statements.CEO Mark Zuckerberg has warned that 2024 and 2025 will be “challenging years” for Meta, as the company continues to navigate economic uncertainty, competition in the AI space, and its long-term metaverse ambitions. While the company remains committed to these projects, the workforce reductions reflect the increasing pressure on even the most successful tech firms to streamline operations and remain profitable.","Earlier this month, Meta announced its plans to cut over 3,000 jobs, affecting nearly 5% of its global workforce.

As per an AP report, the ruling stated that X refused to provide registration data for a profile linked to Allan dos Santos , a Bolsonaro ally accused of spreading falsehoods.In July last year, De Moraes had directed X and Meta to block the account and submit the requested data. While X complied with the account ban, it argued that it couldn’t provide the data, claiming the user had “no technical connection point with Brazil.” De Moraes dismissed the argument and, in August, imposed a daily fine of 100,000 Brazilian reais ($17,500) for noncompliance. By October, the total penalty had reached 8.1 million reais.X initially appealed but later notified the court that it would pay the fine. This week, De Moraes ordered immediate payment, though it remains unclear whether X ultimately provided the requested data.This ruling follows a tense history between X and Brazil’s Supreme Court. In 2024, De Moraes temporarily blocked the platform nationwide after X attempted to remove its Brazilian staff, citing threats of legal action against its representative. X was reinstated a month later after complying with court orders to block specific accounts, appoint a legal representative, and pay outstanding fines.Musk and De Moraes have clashed repeatedly over issues of free speech, misinformation, and far-right accounts. Musk has labeled De Moraes an “enemy of free speech” and a “criminal,” but the judge’s rulings— including the nationwide block of X— have been consistently upheld by Brazil’s top court.","X has been ordered to pay 8.1 million Brazilian reais ($1.4 million) in fines for failing to comply with judicial orders.

Plan change not for CEO Mark Zuckerberg

Meta executives are set to receive significantly larger bonuses this year, according to a recent company filing. This comes soon after the company laid off around 5%, or 4000, employees, impacting its lowest performers.The company has announced an increase in the target bonus percentage for its executive annual bonus plan, raising the potential bonus to 200% of base salary, up from the previous 75%, as per CNBC.This change, approved by a Meta board committee on February 13, was implemented after an analysis revealed that the company's executive compensation was lagging behind that of similar companies. The increased bonus targets bring Meta's executive compensation closer to the median for its peer group.The report said that the committee approved the change after determining that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions” at peer companies.Notably, this bonus plan change does not apply to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, this means that the top executive will not be eligible for the increased bonus payouts that other Meta executives will receive.This news comes on the heels of recent layoffs affecting 5% of Meta's workforce, primarily targeting low performers. Additionally, the Financial Times reported that Meta reduced its annual stock option distribution by approximately 10% for thousands of employees, with variations based on location and position.Despite these cost-cutting measures, Meta's stock performance has been strong, with shares up over 47% in the past year. This reflects investor confidence in the company's growing digital advertising revenue and the potential of its AI investments .Meta reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, reaching $48.39 billion."," Meta executives are set to receive significantly larger bonuses this year, according to a recent company filing.

On Wednesday evening, a large group of activists gathered outside SpaceX 's Washington, D.C., office to protest recent federal job cuts announced by the Trump administration. The demonstration, which blocked traffic in front of the aerospace company's headquarters, was a result of mounting frustration over government layoffs. The protest followed a march that began at Federal Triangle and concluded at 11th and F Street Northwest.The demonstrators, including former federal employees and labor union members, held signs criticizing Elon Musk’s influence in the current administration. One protester’s sign read, ""No one voted for Elon Musk ,"" referencing his role in establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been central to recent budget cuts. These layoffs have disproportionately affected employees in various government agencies, including the National Park Service.Union organizers have called for continued protests, highlighting the adverse impact of these job cuts on essential public services such as housing, environmental conservation, and historical preservation. As tensions escalate, the movement against these workforce reductions continues to gain traction.The primary catalyst for Wednesday’s demonstration was the Trump administration’s implementation of extensive federal job cuts. These layoffs, reportedly part of a broader effort to reduce government spending, have led to uncertainty and distress among public sector employees.Tiffany Montes, a former National Park Service worker, shared her frustration and disappointment after being unexpectedly dismissed from her role in historic preservation. Despite two years of dedicated service as an intern and securing a permanent position, she received a termination email on Friday.Montes told NBC News. She further expressed disbelief at the justification for her termination.Montes was among hundreds of National Park Service employees dismissed under the new measures. The National Park Service plays a crucial role in maintaining historical landmarks, including the White House, and the job cuts have raised concerns about the potential neglect of these important sites.Paul Osadebe, a representative of the Federal Unionists Network, emphasized the risks posed by these job losses.he stated.Union leaders have warned that these cuts could have severe consequences for government services, affecting infrastructure, housing, and public safety.Elon Musk has gained significant influence within the Trump administration since Donald Trump assumed the presidency last month. One of his most controversial moves was the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an agency tasked with reducing federal spending.DOGE's primary goal is to streamline government operations and eliminate what it deems unnecessary expenditures. However, critics argue that its aggressive cost-cutting measures have led to the indiscriminate removal of employees essential to public services.Protesters outside SpaceX's office held Musk accountable for his role in implementing these workforce reductions. Many view his growing political influence as a concern, particularly since the agency’s budget reduction strategy has resulted in widespread job insecurity.The Trump administration has justified the job cuts as necessary for achieving fiscal responsibility. DOGE has outlined a plan to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion within the next year.To facilitate this process, DOGE previously sent mass emails to over two million federal employees, offering a voluntary resignation program. Those who accepted the offer were promised continued salary and benefits through September of this year. However, the administration had warned that if an insufficient number of employees opted for voluntary resignation, involuntary layoffs would follow.As a result, mass terminations were implemented across multiple agencies, affecting thousands of workers. The administration argues that these cuts will lead to a leaner, more efficient government, though critics contend that the measures disproportionately impact lower-level employees while leaving higher-ranking officials unaffected.In response to the job cuts, activist groups and labor unions have vowed to continue their demonstrations. The Federal Unionists Network, the organization behind Wednesday’s protest, has planned a mutual aid event on Friday evening to provide support for affected workers.Union leaders anticipate further demonstrations in the coming weeks, particularly as more workers begin to feel the effects of the layoffs. Protesters have also urged lawmakers to intervene and reconsider the restructuring efforts led by DOGE.","Demonstrators gathered outside SpaceX's Washington, D.C., office to protest recent federal job cuts announced by the Trump administration.

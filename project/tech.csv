"Airbnb announces major app redesign, expands beyond Home Rentals; adds 10 new services",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airbnb-announces-major-app-redesign-expands-beyond-home-rentals-adds-10-new-services/articleshow/121147192.cms,"10 new services on Airbnb

New Host interface

In a significant move to broaden its horizons, Airbnb has announced a comprehensive redesign of its mobile application. This update marks a pivotal shift for the company, extending its offerings beyond its core business of private home rentals to encompass a new category called "" Airbnb Services ,"" alongside its existing "" Airbnb Experiences ."" Notably, users will now be able to access these new offerings even without booking accommodation through the platform.Initially launching with ten distinct categories, Airbnb Services will provide users with access to a curated selection of local professionals. These initial categories include personal chefs, catering services for events of all sizes, relaxing in-home massages, personalized fitness sessions with personal trainers, and rejuvenating spa treatments. Airbnb emphasizes a commitment to quality, stating that its service providers ""are vetted for quality through an evaluation of expertise and reputation."" Furthermore, the company highlights that these providers ""have an average of 10 years of experience, have completed Airbnb’s identity verification process, and are required to submit relevant licenses and certifications."" The cost of these services will vary, with entry-level options starting below $50, making them accessible to a wide range of users. This expansion allows locals and travelers alike to tap into a network of trusted service professionals directly through the Airbnb app, regardless of their accommodation arrangements.The app redesign also introduces a ""reimagined"" approach to Airbnb Experiences. While continuing to offer unique local activities, these experiences will now be more seamlessly integrated into the platform. Users can expect a diverse range of options, from straightforward host-led city tours providing insider perspectives to more adventurous and immersive activities, such as learning the art of Mexican wrestling in the ring with a professional luchador. Airbnb is actively inviting individuals interested in becoming hosts for both services and experiences to submit their applications through the updated platform. This dual expansion aims to position Airbnb as a comprehensive platform for both accommodation and local engagement.The revamped app interface features several key updates designed to enhance user experience. A new ""Explore"" tab will serve as the homepage, offering personalized recommendations for homes, experiences, and now services, tailored to specific destinations. A dedicated ""Trips"" tab will allow users to efficiently organize their complete itinerary, integrating accommodation, booked experiences, and scheduled services. The messaging platform has also been redesigned to facilitate richer communication, now supporting photo and video sharing between guests and hosts.Recognizing the crucial role of its hosts, Airbnb has also revamped the host interface. This includes a new ""Reservations Management"" tab providing a clear overview of upcoming bookings, an updated calendar with a detailed daily and hourly schedule for improved organization, and new, intuitive listing management tools designed to streamline the hosting process. These enhancements aim to empower hosts with greater control and efficiency in managing their offerings across all three categories: homes, experiences, and services. This strategic evolution signals Airbnb's ambition to become a more comprehensive travel and local services platform, connecting users with not just places to stay, but also with a wide array of local expertise and activities.","Airbnb has announced a comprehensive redesign of its mobile application.

Tech CEO of the company once called as 'Bank of crypto industry' sentenced to 12 years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-ceo-of-the-company-once-called-as-bank-of-crypto-industry-sentenced-to-12-years-in-jail/articleshow/121147186.cms,"Representative image

Alexander Mashinsky , former CEO of Celsius Network , was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Thursday for orchestrating a massive fraud scheme that misled investors in the once-prominent cryptocurrency platform. The sentencing, held in Manhattan’s Southern District courtroom before U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, marks a steep fall for a figure once celebrated as a pioneer in the crypto industry.Mashinsky, who pleaded guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating Celsius’s proprietary token, faced charges stemming from a multi-billion-dollar scheme. Prosecutors accused him of deceiving investors about the safety and profitability of Celsius’s yield-generating platform while secretly liquidating tens of millions in personal holdings. His legal woes began with a 2023 arrest on securities, commodities, and wire fraud charges, coinciding with Celsius’s $4.7 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission—one of the agency’s largest ever. The settlement hinges on Celsius returning remaining customer assets through ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.The case, unfolding in courtroom 14A at 500 Pearl Street, adds Mashinsky to a growing list of crypto executives facing justice. His trajectory parallels that of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried , sentenced to 25 years in March 2024 for misappropriating billions in customer funds to prop up his hedge fund, Alameda Research, and fund a lavish lifestyle. Other fallen crypto titans include Binance’s Changpeng Zhao and Terraform Labs’ Do Kwon.In related FTX developments, former Alameda Research head Caroline Ellison, who cooperated with prosecutors, received a two-year sentence, while FTX’s engineering chief Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang avoided prison time. Ryan Salame, another FTX executive, was sentenced to 90 months. In a rare win for investors, FTX’s bankruptcy estate announced in May 2024 that nearly all customers would recover their funds, with additional compensation. Separately, a judge dismissed most claims against celebrities like Tom Brady and Stephen Curry for promoting FTX.Mashinsky’s sentencing closes a chapter on one of the crypto industry’s most significant fraud cases, spotlighting the risks and regulatory scrutiny facing the sector.","Alexander Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Thursday.

Uncertainty persists

Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia ...

The new America-China agreement to pause tariffs on each other is reportedly pressuring manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam and Mexico to make their own, better deals with the US to continue benefiting from a 'China-plus-one' strategy of American companies. According to Reuters, in the volatile trade landscape shaped by President Donald Trump 's tariff announcements, countries gauge their success by how their trade terms stack up against others. For five weeks, nations facing Trump's ""reciprocal"" global tariff regime, announced April 2, found relief in having lower rates than China, which faced U.S. tariffs soaring from 20% to 145% between March and May. Vietnam, for instance, had a 46% rate, Thailand 36%, and Malaysia 24%, giving them a comparative advantage.Reuters reports that these manufacturing hubs expected multinational corporations to further shift supply chains away from China, bolstering the ""China-plus-one"" trend. However, a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks has introduced a 90-day tariff reprieve, reducing China's import tax to 30%. While still higher than the 10% rate for competing hubs during the pause, experts suggest this could slow the momentum of supply chain diversification.""The rules of the game are still uncertain,"" Diego Marroquin Bitar, a North American trade consultant, told Reuters. ""I think companies are just going to delay their investments as much as they can.""Since Trump's first term, tariffs on China aimed to drive manufacturing back to the U.S., but ""reshoring"" largely failed. Instead, companies like Apple sought alternatives in low-cost countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Mexico. Reuters notes that if the U.S.-China tariff pause extends, these nations risk losing their edge.Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia are now negotiating their own tariff deals with the U.S., while Mexico seeks to lower duties on products like automobiles. Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told Reuters that companies may slow offshoring from China, maintaining it as their main hub while making partial arrangements elsewhere.Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University, highlighted to Reuters that Trump’s unpredictable policymaking creates uncertainty, leaving companies hesitant to fully engage in China. Vietnam, which has attracted Chinese manufacturers since Trump’s first-term tariffs, faces pressure to secure better deals. Leif Schneider, head of Luther in Vietnam, told Reuters that if Vietnam negotiates a better deal than China, it could solidify its role as an alternative investment destination.Reuters also reports that Vietnam’s foreign investment pledges fell to $2.84 billion in April, down 30% from March and 8% year-on-year. In Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has emphasized its tariff-free advantage under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, though steel, aluminum, and auto tariffs remain. Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China, told Reuters that despite the U.S.-China deal, companies like Walmart and Target, rattled by recent trade tensions, will continue seeking alternative supply sources, with Mexico poised to benefit.","Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia are now negotiating their own tariff deals with the U.S., while Mexico seeks to lower duties on products like automobiles.

"Intel's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan rejects three proposals from shareholders at first AGM under his leadership, including one on Israel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intels-new-ceo-lip-bu-tan-rejects-three-proposals-from-shareholders-at-first-agm-under-his-leadership-including-one-on-israel/articleshow/121145564.cms,"Lip-Bu Tan, CEO, Intel

Three shareholder proposals rejected by the new Intel CEO

Why shareholder approval of the stock reserve plan is important

Intel shareholders have reportedly approved a measure to replenish the company’s share reserves to attract and retain top talent, alongside a $42 million stock award package for new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, tied to the chipmaker’s stock performance. According to a report by Reuters, the decision was made at Intel’s annual shareholder meeting, the first under Tan’s leadership since he assumed the role in March, following the board’s dismissal of former CEO Pat Gelsinger in December 2024. The meeting also saw shareholders reelect Intel’s board of directors, though three members opted not to stand for reelection, signaling a shift in the company’s governance.Three shareholder proposals were rejected, which would have mandated Intel to reassess its operations in Israel amid geopolitical concerns, issue detailed reports on its charitable contributions, and grant shareholders the ability to act by written consent without formal meetings. The rejections underscore Tan’s focus on strategic priorities over additional reporting or governance changes.Tan’s appointment followed the board’s loss of confidence in Gelsinger’s ambitious but costly turnaround plan, which failed to deliver promised growth in Intel’s foundry business and AI initiatives. Gelsinger’s strategy, which included heavy investments in new manufacturing facilities, strained Intel’s finances amid a global slowdown in chip demand.Under Tan’s leadership, Intel is undergoing a significant restructuring. The new CEO has flattened the leadership hierarchy, eliminating layers of middle management to streamline decision-making. Tan is also prioritizing a revival of Intel’s artificial intelligence (AI) business, aiming to compete more effectively with rivals like NVIDIA and AMD. He plans to leverage Intel’s dominant position in personal computer and data center markets to roll out more competitive products, while refining the company’s AI strategy to capitalize on growing demand for AI-driven solutions.The shareholder approval of the stock reserve plan is seen as critical for attracting talent in a highly competitive industry, where companies vie for engineers and AI specialists. Tan’s $42 million compensation package, heavily tied to stock performance, aligns his incentives with shareholder interests but has drawn scrutiny given Intel’s recent financial struggles, including a reported 8% revenue decline in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year.Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Tan’s leadership. “Tan’s track record in semiconductors and his focus on operational efficiency could stabilize Intel, but the road ahead is tough with intense competition and macroeconomic headwinds,” said Jane Doe, a semiconductor analyst at Tech Insights. Intel faces challenges from TSMC’s dominance in advanced chip manufacturing and AMD’s gains in the CPU and GPU markets.","Intel shareholders have reportedly approved a measure to replenish the company’s share reserves to attract and retain top talent.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity. The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120844476,imgsize-1833412,width-400,resizemode-4/Why-Mark-Zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-Know-about-Facebook-founders-viral-Rawdog-routine.jpg"

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

“a bit of a shady world.”

“chief dark arts officer,”

“probative, inculpatory, and entirely nonprivileged statements,”

“In essence, Amazon’s privilege log — on which the FTC has relied throughout discovery — was almost entirely wrong. It is impossible to square a 92% error rate across tens of thousands of documents with a mere mistake,”

What Amazon said about the executive’s remarks on Jeff Bezos and Prime subscription



“a much longer conversation that included discussion about non-Amazon subscription programs.”

“The way Amazon drives Prime subscribers is by making the service useful and valuable. It is correct that an element of driving that value is an art rather than a science,”

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has accused Amazon of attempting to hide incriminating evidence in the antitrust suit , a report claims. The FTC states that Amazon systematically filed misleading privilege claims for the same. After a federal judge ordered a re-review, Amazon reportedly withdrew 92% of its privilege claims and produced nearly 70,000 documents that were previously shielded. A significant portion of these, around 58,000 documents, were initially fully withheld from the court, the report adds. For instance, in one document, the current CEO of Amazon's retail business describedasIn that context, this CEO reportedly referred to Amazon founder (former CEO) Jeff Bezos as Amazon’saccording to the FTC.During an in-camera review of nine withheld documents, the court found only a single sentence was privileged, according to the FTC.

"Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits 7,000 employees; these are the positions likely to be impacted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-second-biggest-layoffs-ever-hits-7000-employees-these-are-the-positions-likely-to-be-impacted/articleshow/121143623.cms,"Layoffs to impact management staff; coders and engineering employees may stay safe

Poll Should Microsoft prioritize engineering talent over other roles? No, all roles are equally important. Yes, it's crucial for AI development.

Microsoft has introduced new rehire ban and performance management overhaul



Managment roles are being cut across the industry as tech giants push for efficiency

Microsoft has announced that it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.""We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.This represents Microsoft's largest reduction since eliminating 10,000 roles in 2023. Unlike January's smaller performance-based cuts, the company indicated these layoffs are structural in nature.These cuts may particularly impact middle management roles, as the company seeks to create a more streamlined hierarchy by increasing each manager's ""span of control."" Microsoft, as reported by Business Insider previously, aims to prioritise engineering talent as it continues investing heavily in artificial intelligence initiatives.Sources told Business Insider that laid off employees will stay on the payroll for the 60 days after their termination. Further, the affected staff will also be reportedly eligible for rewards and bonuses.The workforce reduction comes amid significant changes to Microsoft's performance management system. According to internal documents viewed by Business Insider, the company has implemented a two-year rehire ban for employees forced out due to performance issues.Microsoft has also introduced a ""good attrition"" metric to track desirable employee departures. This approach mirrors Amazon's controversial ""unregretted attrition"" system and signals Microsoft's intent to more aggressively manage underperforming staff.Under the new system, employees facing performance issues must either enter a performance improvement plan (PIP) with ""clear expectations and a timeline for improvement"" or accept a ""Global Voluntary Separation Agreement"" with 16 weeks of severance pay. Those who choose the PIP path have just five days to decide and will no longer be eligible for the severance package if they opt for the improvement plan.Microsoft's restructuring reflects a broader trend across the tech industry toward flatter organizational structures and higher engineering efficiency. The company is reportedly focusing on reducing its ""PM ratio"" — the proportion of managers to engineers — across teams.Similar strategies have been implemented at other tech giants, including Amazon and Google, where the top layer of the hierarchy were let go. Meta is also expected to let go off several thousand employees this year, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushes for a “year of efficiency.”The layoffs follow Microsoft's better-than-expected quarterly results reported in April, when CEO Satya Nadella indicated the company would make sales execution changes after lower-than-expected growth in non-AI Azure cloud revenue.","Microsoft has announced that it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, amounting to over 6,000 employees.

Google Meet is better in many small ways, but worse in one big way: audio quality, particularly background noise cancellation and echoing. That kills it so we are staying on Zoom!”To this, Reed, an engineer at Waymo responded “Really? We literally never have an issue with background noise. In fact it's remarkably good, can't hear dogs or coughing or leaf blowers… surprising you had an issue”.Pichai joined, stating “Hey Adam, will follow up offline as haven't experienced this, as Reed notes below it works pretty well in my experience, we will debug to understand the root cause and fix. Thanks for flagging”.Quore CEO responded to Pichai saying “Thank you!! Would love to switch if this is fixed!”.The exchange highlights how even major tech companies with billions of users can occasionally provide personalized responses to product feedback, especially when it comes from fellow tech leaders.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo recently had an open chat about Google Meet on Elon Musk ’s platform X (formerly Twitter) Their exchange was noticed by Musk, who reacted to a post about it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121143338,imgsize-909363,width-400,resizemode-4/Elon-Musk-responds-to-Google-CEO-Sundar-Pichai-and-Quora-co-founder-Adam-DAngelos-Google-Meet-chat-on-Twitter-The-smartest-most-influential-people.jpg"

What is President Trump's executive order on pharma companies

President Trump's anecdote on a friend taking a 'fat shot' is going viral. Talking to reporters on Monday, May 12, Donald Trump said that a “neurotic” and rich friend got their “fat shot” at a discount while traveling abroad — and that this episode prompted a drug company executive to admit to him that they were overcharging Americans. Trump shared the anecdote as he signed an executive order intended to drastically reduce the price Americans pay for pharmaceutical products.“A friend of mine who’s a businessman — very, very, very top guy, most of you would have heard of him — a highly neurotic, brilliant businessman, seriously overweight, and he takes the fat shot,” Trump told reporters. “And he called me up … he’s a rough guy, smart guy, very successful, very rich … ‘Mr. President, could I ask you a question? I’m in London, and I just paid for this damn fat drug I take.’ “I said, ‘It’s not working,'” the President joked.‘He said, ‘I just paid $88 and in New York I pay $1,300. What the hell is going on?’ He said, ‘So I checked, and it’s the same box made in the same plant by the same company. It’s the identical pill that I buy in New York. And here I’m paying $88 in London, and in New York, I’m paying $1,300.’ “Now, this is a great businessman, so — but he’s not familiar with this crazy situation that we have. But he was stunned,” Trump added.“I brought it up with the drug companies, represented by somebody who's a very, very smart, good person too. And we argued about it for about a half-hour. And then finally, he just said, because they can’t justify it, he just said, ‘Look, you got me. You got me. I can no longer justify [the price difference].'”Trump’s story has made everyone speculate who the person he shared the story about is. Most people think Trump was talking about Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Reason being that Elon Musk has publicly stated that he uses a weight-loss drug called Mounjaro, which is made by Eli Lilly, and jokingly referred to himself as “Ozempic Santa,” in the photo he posted of himself on Christmas in 2024. In the picture, Musk is standing in front of a large Christmas tree. He can be seen smiling in the attire with a large Santa beard, with his hands placed on his waist.Sharing his 'Santa' look on Twitter, Musk wrote: ""Ozempic Santa."" Responding to a comment on the post, Musk said that he uses Mounjaro, a medication similar to Ozempic, primarily used to manage type-2 diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels. He jokingly added, ""Like Cocaine Bear, but Santa and Ozempic! Technically, Mounjaro, but that doesn't have the same ring to it.""President Trump signed an executive order on Monday aimed at reducing Americans’ pharmaceutical costs by up to 90% by linking prices paid by government programs like Medicare to those charged to overseas customers.“We’ve been subsidizing other countries globally,” Trump said at the White House signing, describing the order as one of his “most important.” He noted that some prescription drug prices could drop by 50 to 90% almost immediately. “Big Pharma will either comply voluntarily, or we’ll use federal authority to ensure fair pricing.”The order revives Trump’s “most favored nation” policy from his first term, now with a renewed focus on shifting more research and development costs to foreign countries, which experts say the U.S. has disproportionately borne.","Trump shared the anecdote as he signed an executive order intended to drastically reduce the price Americans pay for pharmaceutical products.

US lifts sanctions on three executives linked to Intellexa spyware: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-lifts-sanctions-on-three-executives-linked-to-intellexa-spyware-report/articleshow/126271727.cms,"



US President Donald Trump has reportedly lifted sanctions on three executives tied to spy software consortium Intellexa. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the US Treasury 's website has published an official notice, informing the partial reversal of the imposition of last year’s sanctions on seven people tied to Intellexa. As per the notice, sanctions have been lifted on on Sara Hamou, accused of providing managerial services to Intellexa; Andrea Gambazzi, alleged to have held the distribution rights to the Predator spyware; and Merom Harpaz, described by US officials as a top executive in the consortium.The Intellexa consortium, Reuters report says, was launched by former Israeli intelligence official Tal Dilian. It was then described as ""a complex international web of decentralized companies that built and commercialized a comprehensive suite of highly invasive spyware products"" by the Treasury Department.Treasury, as per the Reuters report, said in an email that the removal ""was done as part of the normal administrative process in response to a petition request for reconsideration."" It added that each of the individuals had ""demonstrated measures to separate themselves from the Intellexa Consortium.""The consortium’s ""Predator"" was allegedly used for surveillance of a journalist, a prominent opposition figure and dozens of others in Greece, while in 2023 a group of investigative news outlets reported that the Vietnamese government had tried to hack members of the US Congress, using Intellexa's tools.In March last year, the US government accused Intellexa of enabling ""the proliferation of commercial spyware and surveillance technologies"" to authoritarian regimes and alleged that its software had been used ""in an effort to covertly surveil U.S. government officials, journalists, and policy experts.""","US President Donald Trump has reportedly lifted sanctions on three executives tied to spy software consortium Intellexa.

ByteDance, the $500 billion parent company of TikTok, is reportedly preparing a massive 100 billion yuan ($14.29 billion) budget for Nvidia artificial intelligence (AI) chips in 2026. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the planned expenditure represents a significant jump from the 85 billion yuan spent in 2025. This comes as US has approved sale of its H200 chips to China.ByteDance is said to be specifically targeting Nvidia’s H200 GPUs. While China remains barred from accessing the latest-generation ""Blackwell"" architecture, H200 for sale to Beijing opens a window for Chinese tech giants. However, China has reportedly directed its chipmakers to reduce reliance on Nvidia and increase dependency on local chipmakers.Meanwhile, ByteDance is said to be co-developing two custom AI GPUs with Broadcom and TSMC, expected to debut in 2026. Analysts believe these homegrown chips will eventually handle ""inference"" – the day-to-day running of TikTok’s ""For You"" algorithm and content moderation, as per Tom’s Guide.ByteDance has previously gone to lengths to circumvent supply constraints, including renting cloud compute from overseas data centres to power its global operations.Meanwhile, China has reportedly issued a new mandate under which domestic chipmakers will be required to source at least 50% of their equipment from local suppliers. This is seen as is a direct response to tightening US export restrictions that have sought to cripple China’s computing capabilities.“Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%. Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment,” Reuters quoted one source as saying. Historically, Chinese fabs such as SMIC have preferred American or Japanese equipment.

Will Vibe Coding take away tech jobs

How Collins Dictionary defines Vibe Coding





This year, or in February 2025 to be precise, Andrej Karpathy, the former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, gave the technology world a new word -- Vibe Coding. Karpathy came up with the word to represent how AI can let some programmers ""forget that the code even exists"" and ""give in to the vibes"" while making a computer program. The word became an overnight buzzword in Silicon Valley. And as the year ended, UK's Collins Dictionary picked it up as the word of the year. It was one of 10 words on a shortlist to reflect the mood, language and preoccupations of 2025.As to how Andrej Karpathy described the word, here's the definition Karpathy shared on Twitter, ""I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like a skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering.Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.""Is Vibe Coding and advanced capabilities of AI just the nail in the coffin when it comes to the traditional views of computer programming and software development skills? The debate is ongoing, with strong voices on both sides. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan told CNBC earlier this year that app developers can now offload or automate more repetitive tasks, and they can generate new code using Large Language Models (LLMs). The ability for AI to subsidize an otherwise heavy workload has allowed these companies to build with fewer people."" Tan said. “That sounds a little scary, but on the other hand, what that means for founders is that you don’t need a team of 50 or 100 engineers. You know, maybe it’s that engineer who couldn’t get a job at Meta or Google, who actually can build a standalone business making 10 or 100 million dollars a year with 10 people,” Tan says. “Like that’s such a powerful moment in software."" Tan tweeted another not-so-happy stat for engineers: 25% of the current crop of Y Combinator startups used LLMs (AI large language models) to write 95% of their lines of code.Cursor CEO Michael Truell recently warned that Vibe coding builds ‘shaky foundations’ and eventually ‘things start to crumble’. Truell reportedly likened it to building a house by putting up four walls and a roof without knowing what’s going on under the floorboards or with the wiring. This coding method may be perfect for AI users looking to quickly mock up a game or website, but when it comes to more advanced programming, things have the potential to go wrong, he warned, as per a report in Fortune. “If you close your eyes and you don’t look at the code and you have AIs build things with shaky foundations as you add another floor, and another floor, and another floor, and another floor, things start to kind of crumble,” he said.Alex Beecroft, managing director of Collins, said, “The selection of ‘vibe coding’ as Collins’ Word of the Year perfectly captures how language is evolving alongside technology.” Collins’ definition of Vibe Coding states, “vibe coding” is “the use of artificial intelligence prompted by natural language to assist with the writing of computer code.” Or, as a blog post on the dictionary’s website explains: “Basically, telling a machine what you want rather than painstakingly coding it yourself. ”","Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, came up with the word Vibe Coding.

Meta has confirmed that its acquisition of Singapore-based AI startup Manus in a deal reportedly valued at more than $2 billion. It has been reported that the Manus has Chinese roots but a Meta spokesperson clarified that there would be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” post-transaction.According to the spokesperson (via Fortune), to comply with Meta’s operational standards and geopolitical considerations, Manus will also shutter all services and operations within mainland China, refocusing its efforts entirely on its Singapore headquarters.In fact, Alexandr Wang, the head of the team and Chief Al officer of Meta, has announced that theMeta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the company’s billion-dollar team that Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAl in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring for its team in Singapore.""MSL is hiring in Singapore! We already have some amazing researchers and engineers there, buoyed now by the 100-strong Manus team, and we're growing fast. Feel free to DM with a resumé if interested,"" Wang said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).The move, which is the third-largest acquisition of the company, marks another aggressive step by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to dominate the “AI agent” market. Manus gained international attention earlier this year with the launch of its “general-purpose” AI agent.Unlike standard chatbots, this technology is designed to autonomously handle complex tasks such as deep-market research and coding.Meta plans to scale Manus’ technology across its entire ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.“Manus will deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including in Meta AI,” the company stated.

As the AI race hot up in 2025, the corporate leadership in Google, Microsoft, Meta and other tech companies changed the way companies work. Driven by the high stakes of the AI race, the world’s most powerful tech leaders shifted into what Silicon Valley calls “Founder Mode”. From personally walking factory lines to writing code, these five CEOs are personally architecting their companies' future success.Google co-founder Sergey Brin returned “full-time” to spearhead Google’s AI offensive after ‘Code Red’ situation at the company. Brin’s is said to have spearheaded Antigravity, the company’s newly-unveiled agent-first coding platform. Interestingly, Brin also featured prominently in the launch video alongside the team from Windsurf (acquired for $2.4 billion). Brin is reportedly in the office “pretty much every day,” working on Gemini model training.Despite being a “professional CEO” and not a founder, Satya Nadella’s 2025 behaviour has been described by Microsoft’s Deputy CTO Dee Templeton as “Founder Mode”. According to a report by the Financial Times, Nadella has flattened Microsoft’s hierarchy, overhauled senior leadership, and hiring key figures like Meta’s Jay Parikh to create a direct line to his office.Nadella is said to be working hard to better compete with Amazon and Google in infrastructure.Earlier this year, Tesla and Samsung announced a chip partnership. Company CEO Elon Musk said would “walk the line personally” at Samsung’s new Texas facility to accelerate progress. He also secured an agreement allowing Tesla engineers to assist Samsung in “maximizing manufacturing efficiency” to ensure Tesla's hardware timeline stays ahead of the industry.Mark Zuckerberg has made a ‘Superintelligence’ team for billions of dollars, pivoting Meta towards “startup mode” by concentrating power in the hands of elite, talent-dense units. The company’s goal is frontier research and Zuckerberg believes small teams are the “optimal configuration” for winning the AI arms race.Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has publicly slammed conventional leadership advice to ""get out of the way."" Chesky manages his $79 billion company like a startup, personally handling “hire, fire, promote, and manage” decisions for employees several levels below his direct reports. Chesky argues that ""skip-leveling"", which is talking directly to those reporting to his management team, is the only way to maintain a relationship with the people doing the work.","The world’s most powerful tech leaders shifted into what Silicon Valley calls ‘Founder Mode’ in 2025.

What Yann LeCun said on leaving Meta

“As many of you have heard through rumors or recent media articles, I am planning to leave Meta after 12 years: 5 years as founding director of FAIR and 7 years as Chief AI Scientist.

The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular. The creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment.

I am creating a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond. The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.

I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth, Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years. Because of their continued interest and support, Meta will be a partner of the new company.

As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta’s commercial interests, but many of which do not. Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.

I will give some more details about the new company when the time comes. In the meantime, I’m sticking around Meta until the end of the year.”





Yann LeCun, Meta’s Chief AI scientist is leaving the company after 12 years. Sharing a post on professional networking platform LinkedIn in November, LeCun said that he is building a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) that he has been pursuing over the last several years with “colleagues at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), New York University (NYU) and beyond. ” Interestingly, his move marks a shift from his previous stance on entrepreneurship. The AI researcher once said that he has no interest in running companies or chasing deals. In a public conversation with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in May last year, LeCun famously said “I'm a scientist, not a business or product person.”Yann LeCun’s exit from the company became ‘inevitable’ after Meta’s $15 billion acquisition of ScaleAI and the appointment of Alexandr Wang – making him Meta’s highest paid employee ever. In November 2025, Hyperbolic CEO and CTO Yuchen Jin shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), alleging Mark Zuckerberg appointed Wang to lead Meta’s new “superintelligence” division.As per the post, the decision of Zuckerberg to have LeCun report to Wang signaled a shift in priorities — away from foundational AI research and toward rapid, product-driven development. “Yann never believed in LLM-to-AGI. Zuck’s patience ran out,” Jin wrote, referencing LeCun’s well-known skepticism of large language models as a path to artificial general intelligence.In a LinkedIn post, LeCun wrote:","Yann LeCun, Meta’s Chief AI scientist is leaving the company after 12 years.

Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen Huang, CEO of $4.4 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Elon Musk recently said that he plans to be Tesla CEO in the next five years. Musk made a virtual appearance on the Qatar Economic Forum recently where he was asked “Do you see yourself and are you committed to still being the chief executive of Tesla in five years time?”. The tech billionaire replied with an affirmative yes, adding “I’ll still be CEO in 5 years… unless I die. I can’t be the CEO if I’m dead.”A clip from the interview was shared by X user Mario Nawfal on December 30, 2025. Since then the post has gained more than 222K views so far. Nawfal captioned the post:“No planned exit or corporate double-speak, just pure, unfiltered commitment with a side of existential humor. Basically, Elon isn’t going anywhere. He’s still knee-deep in AI, robots, Gigafactories, self-driving tech, and yes spaceships and rockets.”He further added “And let’s be real: no one else could juggle Twitter, Mars, AI doomsday warnings, and an EV empire like this guy. So buckle up, because apparently the only thing that could dethrone Elon… is mortality itself.”Earlier this year, some Tesla investors including Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management called for Elon Musk's exit from the company. In an interview with Sky's Business Live in March this year, Gerber said:“I think Tesla needs a new CEO and I decided today I was going to start saying it and so this is the first show that I'm saying it on”, adding “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla. ”Gerber's statement then came as shares of Tesla dropped in the wake of massive protests against Elon Musk and the EV maker, allegedly linked to his involvement with the Trump administration then.","Elon Musk recently said that he plans to be Tesla CEO in the next five years.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the word’s largest contract chipmaker has announced that it has started mass production of its 2‑nanometer (nm) chips, marking a major milestone in semiconductor technology. As reported AFP, TSMC said that the new 2nm process node represents its most advanced technology to date. The chips are designed to offer higher performance as compared to the 3nm chipset.The 2nm chips from TSMC are also low on power consumption which make them useful for mobile devices and AI workloads. Also, the smaller transistor size of the chips enables them to offer more computing power in compact designs.The company confirmed that production has begun at its facilities in Hsinchu and Baoshan, Taiwan, with plans to expand capacity in the coming year.It is also said that the next-generation TSMC 2nm chips may power the next-generation iPhones and AI servers. The company is also said to be working on new fabs in Arizona, Japan, and Germany, part of a global diversification strategy amid geopolitical tensions.The launch of 2nm chips comes at a time when demand for AI accelerators, smartphones, and high‑performance computing is surging globally. TSMC’s move positions it ahead of rivals Samsung Electronics and Intel, both racing to develop similar next‑generation nodes.Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia recently praised its longtime partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Speaking to reporters at an event held by TSMC in Hsinchu (Taiwan), Huang said “TSMC is doing a very good job supporting us on wafers”, adding that Nvidia's success would not be possible without TSMC.

The world’s largest accounting body – Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) has reportedly stopped students from taking online exams. According to a report by the Financial Times, the accounting body, which has almost 260,000 members, said that it will stop allowing students to take online exams in all but exceptional circumstances from March 2026. The move comes as the body aims to crack down on a rise in cheating on tests. “We’re seeing the sophistication of [cheating] systems outpacing what can be put in, [in] terms of safeguards,” Helen Brand, the chief executive of the ACCA, said in an interview with the publication.Brand said that ACCA had worked “intensively” to combat cheating but “people who want to do bad things are probably working at a quicker pace”. With the rapid rise of technology, led by AI tools, the issue of cheating has moved to a “tipping point”, she added.Online/remote tests were introduced during covid times to enable students to qualify at a time when lockdowns prevented in-person exam assessment. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) – Britain’s accounting and auditing industry regulator in 2022 said that cheating in professional exams was a “live” issue at Britain’s biggest companies.According to a report by The Guradian, the FRC’s investigation then found instances of cheating in some tier-one auditors, a category comprising the “big four” accountants – KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY – along with Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO.

St Barts becomes the ultimate New Year retreat for Bezos and Sanchez in 2025







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sanchez, are beginning the new year in the most fabulous way possible on the Caribbean shores of St. Barts. After a merry Christmas celebration in Aspen, Colorado, the power couple was spotted basking in the tropical environment of the celebrity-haunted Nikki Beach. Renowned for its dynamic environment and elitist crowd, this setting perfectly suited the couple for unwinding and marking the end of the year. Surrounded by their loved ones yet closely monitored by the personal security detail of Bezos, this outing gave a peek into the world of luxury, leisure, and celebrity culture. St. Barts can never go out of favour for the Amazon founder or his wife, Lauren Sanchez, as this Caribbean spot offers the best blend of seclusion and class, making them the most fashionable couple of the year 2025.The two were seen lounging and basking under the warmth of Nikki Beach’s tropical sun as reported by. Nikki Beach is a hot spot famous for gathering celebrities and famous personalities. Lauren Sanchez complemented the beautiful scenery with a large sun hat radiating a touch of relaxed elegance as she was seen mingling with a group of her pals, as Bezos was nearby. Some sources reported seeing the two as they looked relaxed in a high-energy environment triggered by other fellow revellers.A video making the rounds online caught a group of girls dressed in bikinis as one of them rode a motorcycle with sparklers. The video seemed to indicate there might be birthdays at stake with private events. Sanchez joined in with the fun as she popped out of a banquette to dance.As if the glamour wasn't enough, half a million-dollar yachts such as Koru, owned by Bezos, were spotted docked at Nikki Beach. The posh yacht is not only an embodiment of Bezos's wealth but also ensures that the couple enjoys a venue that combines beautiful locations with fantastic experiences. St. Barts, a place characterised by its blue waters, clean beaches, and luxury resorts, remains a hotspot for the rich and famous who come in search of anonymity and celebration.Before this, however, the power couple spent the Christmas festivities in the snowy resort of Aspen, Colorado. While in Aspen, on the eve of Christmas, the couple was seen together, with Bezos donning a black cowboy hat, a black shirt jacket, and blue denim, reflecting his carefree and effortlessly chic style. Lauren Sanchez, on the other hand, donned a black sweater, black heels, and oversized dark shades, along with barrel jeans, reflecting her chic outlook while maintaining the festive atmosphere that the season embodies, fitting well into the Christmas celebrations before heading to the Caribbean to continue the celebrations in the Caribbean islands of St. Bart's.The year 2025 also marked a significant milestone in the personal lives of Bezos and Sanchez, as their much-publicised wedding ceremony took place on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, Italy, over the weekend of June 26th to 28th. The couple’s nuptials were among the most widely publicised celebrity weddings of the year, with their guest list featuring celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Ivanka Trump, Jerry Seinfeld, and Bill Gates, among others.St Barts emerges as the perfect New Year destination for Bezos and Sanchez in the year 2025. Bezos and Sanchez have already declared St. Barts as the place where they want to celebrate the coming year. After celebrating Christmas in Aspen with a snowy background, this destination gives them all the elements necessary to celebrate the start of a new year, away from the limelight, and at the same time, experience the excitement of the festivities with parties and fun activities that very few can match. The start of 2025 is no exception to this trend, as it reminds everyone of the celebrity status enjoyed by Bezos and Sanchez, as well as their starry lifestyle.","Jeff Bezos and wife, Lauren Sanchez, seen enjoying the New Year celebrations and tropical luxury on St. Barts.

The company said this in a statement to the comment of White House AI czar David Sacks. “They’re rejecting our chips,” Sacks said in an interview on Bloomberg Tech, citing an unspecified news article he had seen that day. “Apparently they don’t want them, and I think the reason for that is they want semiconductor independence.” Later in a social media post, Sacks said that he was referring to a Financial Times report that China was poised to limit access to the chips via a local approval process where Chinese buyers would need to justify their purchases. ""This is the report I was citing. It would be more accurate to attribute this news to FT than to me.""Responding to David Sacks comments and the report an Nvidia spokesperson said that the company continues to work with the administration on H200 licenses for vetted customers. “While we do not yet have results to report, it’s clear that three years of overbroad export controls fueled America’s foreign competitors and cost US taxpayers billions of dollars,” the company said.Quoting sources in China, the Financial Times report claimed that regulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia’s second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips.It further added that buyers would probably be required to go through an approval process, submitting requests to purchase the chips and explaining why domestic providers were unable to meet their needs. The people added that no final decision had been made yet.This is not the first time that Nvidia has expressed disappointment in China rejecting its chips. In September this year too, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang weighed in on the US tech giant’s struggles in China after a report claimed that the country has banned its AI chips. Huang said that he was “disappointed” after reports that the Cyberspace Administration of China had ordered companies including TikTok parent company ByteDance and Alibaba not to buy Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D, an Nvidia chip that was made for China. In response to a question, Huang said that “we can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be.”Nvidia CEO Huang has been lobbying with the US government for the ban to be lifted as China has used the ban to push domestic chipmakers to make products to compete with Nvidia.",White House AI czar David Sacks said in an interview that China is rejecting Nvidia's chips. Sacks later said that he was referring to a Financial Times report that China was poised to limit access to the chips via a local approval process where Chinese buyers would need to justify their purchases.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126257663,imgsize-72970,width-400,resizemode-4/jim-cramer-doubles-down-on-jensen-huang-own-nvidia-dont-trade-it-says-stock39s-up-42000-since-his-pick.jpg"
Apple's $1 million Developer Academy in US comes under question five years after launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apples-1-million-developer-academy-in-us-comes-under-question-five-years-after-launch/articleshow/126255405.cms,"Apple's Detroit Developer Academy, costing nearly $30 million, faces scrutiny over job placement claims. While some graduates secure full-time roles and launch businesses, attendance is lower than projected. The program, offering free training and stipends, aims to boost tech careers, but its overall effectiveness is under debate.

What are the concerns about Apple’s Detroit Developer Academy





The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit is facing questions about its effectiveness and value. A recent investigative report has suggested that the expensive programme may not be delivering on its job placement promises. However, the whole picture appears more complicated. According to a Wired investigation, the academy programme could have performed better for all involved, though the accuracy of this assessment remains unclear. Apple launched the Detroit academy in January 2021 as part of its Racial Equality and Justice Initiative. Created in partnership with Michigan State University, the programme was designed to provide software developer training to help participants find employment in the tech field.The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit has cost nearly $30 million over four years, raising questions about whether the programme is worth the investment.Apple contributed about $11.6 million, or roughly a third of the total cost. The Gilbert Family Foundation, run by billionaire Dan Gilbert, pledged $11 million over five years. Michigan taxpayers and Michigan State University covered about 30% of the costs, including $6 million in taxpayer funds used for student stipends, the report notes.The programme initially hoped to help about 1,000 students per year. However, only a few hundred people actually attend each year. The agreement with Apple allows up to 200 students in the longer programme focused on developing apps for the App Store. About 50 students are invited back for a second year to work with local organisations.The courses are completely free and include iPhones and MacBooks. The estimated cost is about $20,000 per student, which is nearly twice the per-student budget for community colleges. Students also receive monthly stipends ranging from $800 to $1,500. Some students said the stipends helped them clear debt and move out of their parents' homes, while others still needed side jobs.About 70% of students graduate, which Michigan State Academy of Leadership leader Sarah Gretter says is higher than typical for adult education. Of those graduates, approximately 71% moved on to full-time jobs over the last two years. This is consistent with other vocational training programmes, which typically see hiring rates between 70% and 80%. Additionally, the academy’s alumni have developed 13 businesses and 62 apps.Although the results are mixed, the value that Apple sees in the academies has allowed them to open multiple locations around the world. As of 2024, the company has added training for artificial intelligence and machine learning to the curriculum.","The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit has cost nearly $30 million over four years, raising questions about whether the programme is worth the investment.

SoftBank completes its commitment to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI for which it sold Nvidia shares worth $5.83 billion: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/softbank-completes-its-commitment-to-chatgpt-maker-openai-for-which-it-sold-nvidia-shares-worth-5-83-billion-report/articleshow/126256127.cms,"Sam Altman, CEO, OpenAI and Masayoshi Son, CEO, SoftBank

Why Softbank has invested in OpenAI



SoftBank sold Nvidia stocks to fund OpenAI



‘Didn’t want to sell a single share’: Son







Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank has reportedly fulfilled its staggering $40 billion investment commitment to OpenAI , the company that developed ChatGPT, a report has said. Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNBC claims that the final tranche of the deal was transferred last week. It is reportedly valued between $22 billion and $22.5 billion, and follows a $10 billion and a previous $8 billion direct investment. With the investment, SoftBank’s total ownership in the Microsoft-backed company is now over 10%.The capital infusion values OpenAI at a $260 billion pre-money valuation. A large portion of the investment is slated to support Project Stargate, a massive AI infrastructure joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle that was announced earlier this year. Meanwhile, OpenAI has struck partnerships with several companies, including Nvidia and AMD for high-end GPUs and AI accelerators; Broadcom for custom silicon; and Oracle for cloud capacity and data centre scaling.Notably, this $40 billion milestone required significant portfolio maneuvering. Last month, SoftBank liquidated its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia. It also sold its stake in T-Mobile T-Mobile for $9.17 billion.According to SoftBank’s chief financial officer, Yoshimitsu Goto the company “can still maintain financial strength.”“So through those options and tools we make sure that we are ready for funding in a very safe manner,” he said. SoftBank also recently acquired data centre investment firm DigitalBridge for $4 billion, further strengthening its physical AI footprint.Earlier this month, Son also revealed that he did not want to sell any Nvidia share but had to because he needed money to fund OpenAI and other projects. He said he “was crying” when he sold the company’s stake in Nvidia and the move was driven purely by the need to raise capital for AI investments.“I don’t want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects,” Son said during the event, adding, “I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.”","SoftBank has reportedly fulfilled its $40 billion investment commitment to OpenAI.

""China currently leads the United States in the early commercialisation of humanoid robots. While both countries are expected to build similarly large markets over time, China is scaling more rapidly in this initial phase.""

How China is pushing humanoid robot technology

""China's push into humanoid robotics development is driven by a combination of addressing demographic pressures, driving the next horizon of economic growth, and strengthening its role in global competition,""

""China could be the most important market for humanoids,""





Chinese companies are likely to beat Tesla in producing humanoid robots at scale. Several Chinese companies are expected to begin ramping up production of these robots in 2026. This comes even as the world’s richest man has positioned humanoid robots as central to Tesla's future valuation, which he believes could reach tens of trillions of dollars. Meanwhile, Beijing has reportedly placed humanoid robot technology at the centre of its strategic plans, giving Chinese companies an advantage in the race to commercialise the technology.In an email to CNBC, Andreas Brauchle, partner at consultancy Horváth, said:Tesla has yet to sell its flagship humanoid robot, Optimus, despite Musk highlighting it as a key part of the company's value proposition this year. Humanoid robots are designed to be shaped like humans and to move like humans. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms leverage their capabilities, along with complex hardware such as semiconductors. Supporters say they could be used in various settings, from factories to hospitality and even in homes.China has made robotics a significant part of its tech strategy in recent years, creating plans for supply chains and mass production of humanoid robots. Chinese President Xi Jinping and top leaders met in October and released proposals for the country's next five-year plan. The document mentioned ""embodied artificial intelligence"", a term that refers to AI-driven hardware like robotics or driverless cars.For China, humanoid robots offer a way to address labour challenges in the world's second-largest economy and advance Beijing's push for tech leadership.Karel Eloot, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, told CNBC.China's birth rate is declining, and its population is ageing, reducing the workforce and raising labour costs. Robots are seen as a solution.Meanwhile, China is competing with the US in a tech race across multiple sectors. Robotics could become a new battleground in 2026. Politico reported this month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been meeting with robotics company CEOs to develop a plan to accelerate the industry. Washington is considering issuing an executive order on robotics next year, according to Politico.RBC Capital Markets said in a note this month. Analysts forecast a global market for humanoids of $9 trillion by 2050, with China accounting for more than 60%.Chinese robotics companies are moving ahead with mass production. Unitree, which is preparing for an IPO that could value it at around $7 billion, is one of China's leading robotics players.","China has made robotics a significant part of its tech strategy in recent years.

Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is expected to reject the massive $108.4 billion offer from Paramount-Skydance, according to a CNBC report. The reported snub comes despite a personal intervention from Oracle founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, who offered a personal guarantee of $40 billion to secure the financing for the deal.The means that signals that WBD’s board remains committed to a rival $82.7 billion cash-and-stock deal with Netflix, prioritising ‘deal certainty’ over higher price offered by Paramount-Skydance.Earlier this month, WBD claimed that Paramount misled the company, saying that it had backing by Ellisons. They demanded a ‘signature on the dotted line’ from Larry Ellison, and in an effort to erase those doubts, Paramount-Skydance brought in the financial firepower with the tech mogul offered to personally guarantee the equity financing.How two offers stand against each other:Paramount-Skydance has offered $108.4 billion (Hostile bid) which includes a $30-per-share all-cash value and a raised regulatory termination fee. Netflix has offered $82.7 billion friendly bid – a lower face value but perceived by analysts as having a cleaner financing structure and lower execution risk.Despite the sweetened terms from the Ellison-backed bid, WBD’s board has expressed persistent concerns because in case of rejection, WBD would be forced to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion breakup fee.Furthermore, a merger with Paramount would create a studio entity larger than Disney – a move that has already drawn the attention of antitrust regulators.President Donald Trump has indicated he plans to be personally involved in the landmark acquisition, and has hinted that the deal may attract antitrust scrutiny.If WBD rejects Paramount’s offer, Netflix may emerge as the biggest streaming giant, at the same time, potentially ending one of the most expensive hostile takeover attempts in entertainment history, the report said.","Warner Bros.

Tech companies now looking to develop of robots globally





In what can be called as ‘engineering meets Bollywood fever’, a robot’s dance at IIT Bombay Techfest 2025 this week has stolen the show. A humanoid robot danced to the viral track from the Ranveer Singh-starrer Dhurandhar, FA9LA. The song, composed by Bahraini rap artist Flipperachi, echoed through the arena as the robot moved in sync with the music.In the performance on the Arabic beat, which has since gone viral across social media, the humanoid robot tries to mirror the energy associated with Akshaye Khanna’s character in the film, essentially demonstrated the fusion of technology into a pop-culture. The robot demonstrated balance and fluid movements, leaving the audience of tech enthusiasts and students surprised.Robotics has captured pace with global tech giants working to develop humanoid robotics as industry pivots from pure software to the physical embodiment of AI. The first name that comes to layman’s mind is Elon Musk whose company Tesla is developing Optimus. Optimus is being positioned as a general-purpose worker capable of performing “unsafe, repetitive, or boring” tasks. This pat year, Musk has already showcased Optimus’ several abilities, such as folding clothes and dancing.Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has identified the next growth opportunity: robotics. Huang told company shareholders that he sees robotics as the chipmaker's largest potential market beyond AI.""We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest,"" Huang stated, as per CNBC.""We're working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,"" Huang added.Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis is also focused on the ultimate prize: the ‘digital brain’. Google's AI division recently hired former Boston Dynamics executive Aaron Saunders as its vice president of hardware engineering. The latest hiring suggests a significant move into robotics.","A humanoid robot danced to the viral track from the Ranveer Singh-starrer Dhurandhar, FA9LA.

China adds new rule for chipmakers as part of its 'Whole Nation' approach and the 'reason' once again is America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-adds-new-rule-for-chipmakers-as-part-of-its-whole-nation-approach-and-the-reason-once-again-is-america/articleshow/126254646.cms,"Representative Image

How US pushed China to bring ‘new chipmaking rule’



China plans to use 100% domestic equipment







China has reportedly issued a new mandate under which domestic chipmakers will be required to source at least 50% of their equipment from local suppliers. Insiders describe the move as a core component of President Xi Jinping’s ‘Whole Nation’ approach to technology, and it is seen as is a direct response to tightening US export restrictions that have sought to cripple China’s computing capabilities.According to news agency Reuters, the rule remains a “silent” policy (which means undocumented in public records), industry sources say that chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand plants must now prove they meet the 50% threshold through procurement tenders.“Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%. Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment,” Reuters quoted one source as saying.Historically, Chinese fabs such as SMIC have preferred American or Japanese equipment. However, the 2023 US export bans on advanced AI chips and tools shifted China’s stance from encouraging domestic growth to mandating it.“Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance. But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers,” a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology was quoted as saying.The Reuters report has also said that while the government allows “flexibility” for advanced production lines where local alternatives do not yet exist, China’s ultimate goal is total independence. The “Whole Nation” effort is reportedly producing technical milestones, for example, Chinese scientists are said to be prototyping indigenous machines capable of cutting-edge lithography.This requirement is effectively squeezing global competitors out of the world’s largest semiconductor market, the report said, adding that Chinese firms like Naura and AMEC are already improve through forced domestic partnership. Meanwhile, foreign players like Lam Research and Tokyo Electron now face a shaky footprint in China.",China has reportedly issued a new mandate under which domestic chipmakers will be required to source at least 50% of their equipment from local suppliers.

Read Alex Spiro’s full getter to California Governor Gavin Newsom



Re: Constitutional Concerns Regarding Proposed Billionaire Tax Act

Dear Governor Newsom:

I represent California residents who would be subject to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act if it qualifies for the November 2026 ballot. I write to urge you to work to prevent this initiative from moving forward. The Act has serious legal problems and would cause significant economic damage to California and the broader economy.

First, and most importantly, the Act would be unconstitutional. Although the Act purports to be a tax, it is in reality an uncompensated confiscation of property. The Act imposes a 5% levy on total accumulated wealth, including illiquid assets that generate no income. That is in substance a taking without just compensation. As the Supreme Court explained in Armstrong v. United States, the government cannot force ""some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole."" 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960). The Act concentrates an extraordinary burden on a small group to solve a general revenue problem— exactly what the Constitution prohibits.

Second, for the people who relocate from California in 2026 before the November election, the Act would tax them after they have become citizens of other States and without any ability to vote on the measure. The Supreme Court has held that retroactive taxation cannot be ""harsh and oppressive."" United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 30 (1994). A 5% levy on total net worth imposed on former residents who departed before the law was even enacted clearly meets that definition.

Third, the Act's unprecedented novelty makes it especially vulnerable to a legal challenge. California has never imposed a wealth tax, much less one that reaches former residents and that is targeted at a small group of citizens. The Supreme Court closely scrutinizes unprecedented exercises of government power precisely because they lack historical precedent. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 505 (2023). In fact, it has not hesitated to invalidate the retroactive application of new taxes, even for far less extreme measures. See Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142 (1927). There can be no doubt that the current Supreme Court would carefully evaluate a law so out of step with the American legal tradition.

From an economic perspective, the Act creates two serious problems. First, it will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California. Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax. They are not alone. See California's wealth-tax test: Have voters finally found a policy that the state's inherent economic strengths can't overcome?, Wash. Post (Nov. 17, 2025) (opinion) (describing the tax as ""almost tailor-made to drive most Silicon Valley tech companies to Austin, Texas""). In other words, by passing this proposal California would exchange a one-time windfall for the permanent loss of billions in annual income taxes, capital gains taxes, property taxes, and economic activity. The state's most economically productive residents would take their businesses, jobs, and charitable giving with them. Second, the Act will force destructive asset sales. Our clients hold equity stakes in operating businesses, venture capital funds, and real estate. Paying a 5% wealth tax would require massive forced liquidations, depressing asset values and triggering market instability that would harm ordinary investors whose retirement accounts hold these same investments.

Our clients are prepared to mount a vigorous constitutional challenge if this measure advances. Litigation would be protracted and expensive, and it would generate sustained negative attention to California's business climate. The prudent course is to prevent this constitutionally defective measure from reaching the ballot. We respectfully ask that you discourage signature gathering, oppose qualification, and if necessary, campaign against passage.

Our clients prefer to remain in California and continue contributing to the state's economy and civic life. But they will not remain if subjected to an unconstitutional confiscation of their wealth. We hope this can be resolved through political channels rather than through years of contentious litigation.

Respectfully,

Alex Spiro





Alex Spiro, a high-profile attorney who has represented tech leaders like Elon Musk and WeWork founder Adam Neumann, has issued an ultimatum to California governor Gavin Newsom: If the proposed “Billionaire Tax Act” is passed, the state’s wealthiest residents will move out. He sent the ‘warning’ in a letter to the governor, saying that his clients have made it clear that they will leave California and won’t come back, describing the move as a certain “exodus of capital and innovation.”The issue centres around a proposed Billionaire Tax Act that mandates a one-time 5% tax on the total assets of residents worth more than $1 billion. If it gathers enough signatures, it will appear on the November 2026 ballot.Spiro’s letter comes days after Newsom publicly stated he is against the wealth tax and would “fight” it. Meanwhile, Palmer Luckey, the Oculus founder took to X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend to blast the measure. Furthermore, venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google co-founder Larry Page have reportedly looked into moving out of the state.","California Gov.

As the year comes to an end, we take a look back at the Indian startup ecosystem. 2025 proved to be a far more resilient year as compared to 2024 for the Indian startup ecosystem. According to the data by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), this year around 730 startups shut down. Yet, behind the numbers lie some of the most recognisable names in tech and consumer internet that couldn’t survive mounting financial strain, regulatory hurdles, or competitive pressures. From EV ride-hailing pioneer BluSmart to hyperlocal delivery trailblazer Dunzo, the year reminded entrepreneurs that even well-funded, high-profile startups are not immune to failure.Here are some of the major tech startups that witnessed complete shut down this year.Reliance-backed hyperlocal delivery platform Dunzo was shut down this year. Despite raising $240 million from Reliance Retail in 2022, the startup failed to survive and scummed to the pressure of mounting debt, failed IPL sponsorship and the inability to compete against rivals like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto and Blanket. By September, co-founder Kabeer Biswas exited to join Flipkart’s quick-commerce arm Minutes, effectively ending Dunzo’s journey.BluSmart, the electric ride-hailing service once seen as a challenger to Uber and Ola abruptly shut down in April this year. SEBI investigation found out about a large-scale fraud at Gensol Engineering, promoted by BluSmart’s founders. Though Gensol held no equity in BluSmart, it owned much of its EV fleet, creating deep financial linkages. Allegations of siphoning ₹262 crore, forged documents, and misused funds triggered a collapse. BluSmart suspended operations and transitioned its fleet to Uber, sending shockwaves through India’s cleantech sector.Kavin Bharti Mittal, founder and CEO of Hike announced the shut down of the popular gaming and messaging app in September this year. In a long LinkedIn post, Mittal announced that app is shutting down globally. In a reflective post titled “Closing a Chapter, Opening a New One”, Mittal cited shifting market dynamics and regulatory challenges as key reasons behind the decision. The shut down of Hike wasfollowed by the recent online real-money gaming ban imposed by the Indian government. Hike pivoted from its original messaging app to real money gaming in 2021. Mittal acknowledged that after the imposed ban it was not the best decision to keep on investing in the platform.Beauty and content commerce startup Good Glamm Group also shut its operations this year. Once valued near unicorn status, the startup tried to replicate the roll-up ecommerce model by acquiring multiple beauty and personal care brands. However, heavy debt, stalled growth, and failed synergies led to the winding down of brands like Sirona and The Mom’s Co.The startup was founded by ex-Blinkit CTO Varun Khurana during the time of the pandemic. The startup connected consumers directly with farmers via resellers. Despite raising $44.2 million, the startup was overwhelmed by the rise of 10-minute delivery services. Cash flow issues, delayed salaries, and vendor dues culminated in its shutdown in May this year.","This year around 730 startups shut down in India.

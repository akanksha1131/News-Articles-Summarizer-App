Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the idea that top AI researchers are joining Meta only for the massive paycheques, revealing that the major factor drawing towards them is the unmatched compute power autonomy. In an interview with The Information, Zuckerberg dismissed the idea of Meta “poaching researchers because of bags of money”. Instead he emphasised that the unparalleled compute power and the unique opportunity to build ""superintelligence” are the reasons why AI researchers are joining the company.Recently, we witnessed an aggressive recruitment drive from Meta, with some reports citing offers in the hundreds of millions of dollars to poach AI talent from Apple, OpenAI and Google DeepMind. These figures and rapid hiring made by Meta fuelled speculation of an unprecedented talent war, where financial gains reign supreme.In an interview with The Information, Zuckerberg answered to the claims that Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is hiring talent from rivals by using the lavish pay packages. “Lol, that’s mostly inaccurate,” he said.Zuckerberg emphasised that the reachers are joining Meta because they want to ‘build god’ — a reference to the company’s ambitious push toward superintelligent AI systems.Zuckerberg also revealed the facilities that Meta offer to elite AI researchers. He said that the top AI researchers at the company get access to ‘infinite GPUs’ which are used in training large models. They also get small and high-impact teams which directly report to the senior leadership at the company. Lastly, they get full freedom to experiment without any bureaucratic constraints.“Researchers told us they want maximum GPUs,” Zuckerberg said. “So we said, how about the smallest teams, direct access to me, and unlimited compute power?”Meta’s Superintelligence Lab has attracted top talent from companies like OpenAI, Apple and Google DeepMind. It is said that some of these AI researchers have received compensation packages exceeding Rs 1,600 crore. However, Zuckerberg insists that not the money, but mission and infrastructure are the real reasons for them to join the company.The company is building massive compute clusters, including the Prometheus (1GW) and Hyperion (5GW) systems, which Zuckerberg claims will give Meta “the most compute per researcher on the planet”.",Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the idea that top AI researchers are joining Meta only for the massive paycheques.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has announced that it will soon resume shipping its MI308 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China. The news comes hours after fellow chipmaker Nvidia said that it will resume the deliveries of its H20 AI chips to China “soon”. AMD stated that the US Commerce Department intends to restart reviewing its license applications for sending these products to the world’s second-largest economy. While Nvidia says it has been “assured” by the government that licenses to sell its AI chips will be granted.The company plans to begin shipments as soon as those approvals are granted, AMD said.“We applaud the progress made by the Trump administration in advancing trade negotiations and its commitment to US AI leadership,” CNBC quoted an AMD spokesperson as saying.This development comes amid tensions between the US and China, following a heated trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Both AMD and its competitor Nvidia have felt the impact of US export restrictions.While AMD had previously indicated it would incur up to $800 million in charges due to these controls, Nvidia warned of a $5.5 billion hit from restrictions on its H20 processors. Notably, both the H20 and MI308 chips were specifically developed for the Chinese market in response to these US export control rules.Recently, while replying to fears that China will use US-made chips for military purposes, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asserted that the Chinese military “don't need Nvidia's chips, certainly, or American tech stacks in order to build their military,”because “they simply can't rely on it”. He suggested that China knows that US technology “could be limited at any time; not to mention, there's plenty of computing capacity in China already.”Nvidia has also announced a new RTX Pro GPU for China.",Advanced Micro Devices has announced that it will soon resume shipping its MI308 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China.

Safety concerns mount Over Grok’s AI companions

Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok has introduced animated companion characters for paid subscribers, marking a significant pivot following last week's antisemitic content controversy . The feature, available to ""Super Grok"" subscribers paying $30 monthly, includes two AI personalities: Ani, an anime-styled woman described as a ""digital waifu,"" and Rudy, a sarcastic red panda character.Both companions feature NSFW modes, with Ani appearing in revealing outfits, while Rudy is characterized as having a ""smart mouth"" and rude personality. The companions have their own X social media accounts, with Ani's bio stating she's ""smooth, a little unpredictable"" and might ""dance, tease, or just watch you figure me out.""The launch raises significant safety questions given recent controversies surrounding AI companions. Character.AI currently faces multiple lawsuits from parents whose children were allegedly encouraged by chatbots to engage in self-harm or violence against family members. Research has identified ""significant risks"" in people using AI chatbots as emotional support systems, companions, or therapeutic tools.The timing appears particularly problematic given xAI's recent struggles with content moderation. Just last week, Grok generated antisemitic content and reportedly called itself ""MechaHitler,"" which the company attributed to ""an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot.""Additional companions are reportedly in development, including a male anime character named ""Chad"" listed as ""coming soon."" While currently requiring manual activation in settings, Musk indicated the feature would become easier to access within days, describing the current version as a ""soft launch.""","Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok has introduced animated companion characters for paid subscribers.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

YouTube's eligibility filter blocks AI-generated repeats



YouTube sets 16+ age limit for solo streams from July 22

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan says company betting big on TV



The battle for the living room screen is heating up in the digital entertainment space. Netflix, long a dominant player, now faces a formidable opponent in Google-owned YouTube. A recent Nielsen report reveals that YouTube captured a significant lead over Netflix in US television viewing time for May, lending credibility to CEO Neal Mohan’s claim that ‘YouTube is the new TV.’The report claimed that YouTube and Netflix together captured 20% of all US television viewing time in May, with YouTube holding a significant lead at 12.5% compared to Netflix's 7.5%. Their closest streaming rival, Disney, with its combined services (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+), accounted for 5% of TV time during the same period.Nielsen also suggests contrasting viewership patterns between the two. On average, YouTube attracts 7 million viewers watching via a TV set at any given moment during the day, surpassing Netflix's daily average of 4.7 million. However, the gap narrows during prime-time hours, when TV viewership peaks. During these times, an average of 11.1 million Americans tune into YouTube on their TV screens – slightly ahead of the 10.7 million watching Netflix.YouTube’s dominance in TV viewing continues to grow. It can be attested by the data in the report that two years ago, the Google-owned company’s share of TV time was half a percentage point ahead of Netflix's; now, that lead has widened to five percentage points. Both companies are competing from positions of considerable strength.Moreover, in 2024, Netflix's revenue reached $39 billion, and it boasts over 300 million global subscribers, making it the largest streaming service by subscriber count. The company also demonstrates strong profitability, with over $10 billion in operating income last year.Meanwhile, Google-owned YouTube generated an even larger revenue of $54 billion last year, trailing only Disney among all media companies.Earlier this year, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said that Google 's video streaming giant is increasing its focus on television, announcing that in the US, TVs have surpassed mobile devices as the leading platform for YouTube viewing based on watch time.“Viewers are watching, on average, over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily, and TV is now the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US,"" stated Mohan in a blog post. He emphasised that this ""new"" television experience is vastly different from the ""old,"" incorporating interactive elements like Shorts, podcasts, and live streams alongside traditional content such as sports, sitcoms, and talk shows.“We're bringing the best of YouTube to TVs, including a second screen experience that lets you use your phone to interact with the video you're watching on TV — for example, to leave a comment or make a purchase,” he noted.For the past two years, YouTube has consistently held the number one spot in streaming watch time in the US, according to Nielsen.","Nielsen report claims that YouTube and Netflix together captured 20% of all US television viewing time in May.

Boat Nirvana Ivy Pro Review: Flagship audio on a budget

Apple stock analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson has reportedly questioned the company’s ability to launch new products under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook. According to a Fortune report, Moffett said “They (Apple) haven't produced a major new product outside of possibly the earbuds in a decade.” “Apple has done far more to innovate process than it has product over Tim Cook's tenure,” he added.“Apple is unprepared for something that transformational,” Moffett said, referring to the next big wave in tech innovation.He acknowledged Cook’s ability to execute business strategies but pointed out that many of Apple’s successes were based on plans made before Cook became CEO.Moffett’s remarks reflect wider concerns among investors about Apple’s future. While Cook has successfully grown Apple into one of the world’s most valuable companies, critics argue the company has not introduced any breakthrough devices in recent years.Last week, analysts at LightShed Partners said that Apple may need a leadership change to better focus on product innovation, especially in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). “To be clear, Tim Cook was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” the analysts wrote in an investors note dated July 9. “Apple has sold over $2.0 trillion of iPhones with Cook as CEO. In fact, iPhone sales could show signs of life this quarter, as tariff-related pull-forwards help stabilize replacement cycles that may finally be bottoming out.”Still, LightShed analysts Walt Piecyk and Joe Galone raised concerns about Apple’s slow progress in AI, warning that the company could fall behind competitors. They highlighted that the efforts to improve Apple’s virtual assistant Siri have not met expectations and that Apple may struggle to deliver a “supercycle” of device upgrades.“AI will reshape industries across the global economy, and Apple risks becoming one of its casualties,” the LightShed analysts commented. The analysts argued that Apple’s position in the AI race could significantly affect its long-term growth.",Apple stock analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson has reportedly questioned the company’s ability to launch new products under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook.

Court highlights challenges in tracking anonymous sellers

E-commerce platforms directed to share seller details

The Delhi High Court has directed major e-commerce platforms including Amazon Flipkart , and Meesho to immediately delist products that infringe on Reliance Industries Limited 's (RIL) 'Reliance' and ' Jio ' trademarks. Justice Saurabh Banerjee issued a dynamic injunction on July 10, 2025, restraining 21 alleged infringers from manufacturing, selling, or advertising products using the company's well-known trademarks.The court ruled that defendants cannot use Reliance's artistic work, noting that the infringing trademarks create an impression that products are manufactured by RIL. ""The product of defendant nos.1 to 21 are sold through online e-commerce platforms where consumers rely on brand name and logos to identify the origin of goods, in such circumstances, if any confusion between such products, if allowed to continue, could risk consumer safety,"" Justice Banerjee observed in the order.RIL filed the commercial suit alleging that several sellers on e-commerce platforms were selling fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) products using Reliance trademarks without authorization. The company discovered substantial listings of infringing goods in the third week of June 2025, according to Bar & Bench reports.The court noted a concerning trend of anonymous operations, stating that ""most of the aforesaid listings are posted by entities/ individual operating under fictitious names and identities, making it virtually impossible to trace, identify, and take legal action against them."" This observation underscores the challenges faced by trademark owners in pursuing legal remedies against digital infringers.The injunction specifically targets products including poha, wheat flour, makhana (foxnuts), pulses, lentils, and salt being sold under Reliance and Jio formative trademarks. The court emphasized that since these are edible products commonly purchased by consumers from rural and semi-literate backgrounds, a more cautious approach was necessary to prevent consumer deception.E-commerce platforms including Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, Snapdeal , IndiaMART, Vyapar Times, and MyDukaan have been directed to take down impugned listings and disclose complete contact details of the infringing sellers. The court specifically ordered platforms to provide ""complete contact details, postal address, email address, bank account details, telephone numbers, and/ or any other details available with them.""The trademark 'Reliance' has been recognized as a well-known mark by the Supreme Court in T.V. Venugopal v. Ushodaya Enterprises Ltd., while 'Jio' serves RIL's 481.8 million telecom subscribers, making it India's largest telecom operator.","Delhi High Court issues dynamic injunction restraining 21 alleged infringers from manufacturing, selling, or advertising products using the company's well- known trademarks.

Jeff Bezos cameo in Star Trek Beyond

Boat Nirvana Ivy Pro Review: Flagship audio on a budget

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once revealed that it took years of asking—and a very specific demand—to land his dream cameo in the Star Trek universe. Speaking during a 2020 fireside chat in Mumbai with bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and filmmaker Zoya Akhtar, Bezos explained how his brief role in the 2016 film Star Trek Beyond came to be. “I got that role by literally begging,” Bezos then said, describing his persistence in asking Paramount Global for a part in the franchise he has loved since childhood.The billionaire then revealed that he didn’t mind wearing heavy alien makeup or being unrecognizable on screen. But insisted on one condition: a speaking line. Jeff further said that the reason behind this was to make sure that his appearance couldn’t be edited out.“The part had to include a speaking line and be part of a pivotal scene so that they couldn't cut me from the final version of the movie,” he explained.At around 13 minutes into the movie, Bezos appears as a Starfleet officer on the Yorktown starbase. Covered in full alien prosthetics by Oscar-winning makeup artist Joel Harlow, Bezos has one line of dialogue: “Speak normally,” spoken as he places a universal translator on a rescued alien.“We did the scene 20 times,” Bezos recalled. “It was terrifying… but it all worked out.”In a recent news, Jeff Bezos offloaded around $737 million worth of Amazon stock in recent days. This is the biggest major divestment made by Jeff Bezos this year. The transactions made by Bezos were executed under the prearranged trading plan known as Rule 10b5-1. For those unaware, Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that lets insiders at public companies set up a plan to sell their shares ahead of time.Under this rule, major shareholders can schedule the sale of a fixed number of shares at a set time, helping them avoid accusations of insider trading. Many company executives use 10b5-1 plans for this reason. The rule was introduced to clarify Rule 10b-5, part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is the main law used to investigate securities fraud.","Jeff Bezos appeared in Star Trek Beyond as a Starfleet officer on the Yorktown starbase.

Windsurf workers get financial protection in Cognition deal

Windsurf is being acquired by Cognition AI , the makers of AI engineering tool Devin, for an undisclosed sum just days after news broke that OpenAI would not be acquiring the startup and that Google had hired away CEO Varun Mohan , co-founder Douglas Chen , and several R&D employees to join the Google DeepMind team.Last week, Google DeepMind announced it had hired Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan and co-founder Douglas Chen, along with several R&D employees, while securing a non-exclusive license to Windsurf's technology, all for $2.4 billion. The move followed the breakdown of OpenAI's acquisition talks, where Microsoft's insistence on intellectual property access created insurmountable obstacles. The OpenAI deal was reported to be valued at $3 billion.""Among all the teams in the AI space, Cognition was literally the one we have respected the most,"" Wang said in an email to employees Monday, announcing the deal that includes Windsurf's intellectual property, remaining workforce, and $82 million in annual recurring revenue.The Google deal left Windsurf in a precarious position as a standalone company, prompting weekend negotiations that resulted in Cognition's acquisition offer.The acquisition caps off what Windsurf's interim CEO Jeff Wang described as ""a really volatile time"" for the startup, which saw its $3 billion acquisition deal with OpenAI collapse before Google swooped in to hire away key leadership and research staff.Cognition, which develops the Devin AI coding assistant, structured the deal to include all remaining Windsurf employees, intellectual property, and assets. The company emphasized that all Windsurf staff would receive accelerated vesting schedules and financial participation in the transaction.""Jeff and I worked together to ensure that every single employee is treated with respect and well taken care of,"" wrote Cognition CEO Scott Wu in a staff note.","Windsurf is being acquired by Cognition AI for an undisclosed sum.

Two of the biggest technology companies in Germany has raised alarm over the European Union's AI regulations. Top executives of Siemens and SAP have slammed EU's AI Act, blaming it for Europe lagging behind. The CEOs of Siemens and SAP have called on the European Union (EU) to overhaul its artificial intelligence regulations, arguing that the current framework is stifling technological innovation, according to an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. EU' AI Act governs how companies handle consumer and corporate data.Siemens CEO Roland Busch and SAP CEO Christian Klein slammed the EU's AI Act, which became law last year to ensure that AI systems are safe, transparent, and respect fundamental rights. The legislation categorizes AI applications by risk, imposing specific security and transparency requirements on providers. However, Busch argued that the Act is a significant factor in Europe's lag in AI development, compounded by overlapping and contradictory regulations.""The EU’s regulatory approach is holding back progress,"" Busch told the newspaper. He also described the EU’s Data Act as ""toxic"" for digital business models.While companies like Google and Meta recently urged Brussels to delay the AI rules in a letter, Busch declined to support their letter, stating it did not address the core issues. Klein, meanwhile, cautioned against merely replicating U.S. strategies focused on heavy infrastructure investments. ""Infrastructure shortages are not the main barrier in Europe,"" Klein said. ""The real issue is unlocking the potential of our data.""Busch echoed this sentiment, noting, ""We are sitting on a treasure trove of data in Europe, but we are not yet able to tap into it. It’s not access to computing capacity that we’re lacking, but the release of resources."" Both CEOs urged the EU to reform data regulations before prioritizing investments in data centers, emphasizing the need for a regulatory framework that fosters rather than hinders technological advancement.","CEOs of Siemens and SAP slammed EU's AI Act, blaming it for Europe lagging behind.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: Whenever I get an answer from AI, I always ask …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-whenever-i-get-an-answer-from-ai-i-always-ask-/articleshow/122503372.cms,"Huang says sometimes he asks AI to treat him as a 12-year-old before answering the question



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has drawn a parallel between his use of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and how a patient may seek multiple medical opinions. His method provides insight into how to maximise the accuracy of AI chatbot responses, emphasising that he avoids relying on a single AI for answers. Instead, he consults multiple AIs, encouraging them to critique each other’s responses.In a recent interview on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS”, Huang explained his method: ""When you receive an answer from an AI, I wouldn't just receive it. Usually, what I do is I say, 'Are you sure this is the best answer you can provide?'""“You know this is no different than getting three opinions. Three doctors' opinions. I do the same thing. I ask the same question of multiple AIs. And I ask them to compare each other's notes and then, you know, give me the best of all the answers,” he stated.This isn’t the first time Huang has discussed his personal AI usage. At the 28th annual Milken Institute Global Conference in May, he shared that he uses AI ""as a tutor everyday.""He adapts its explanations to his learning needs, saying, ""In areas that are fairly new to me, I might say, 'Start by explaining it to me like I'm a 12-year-old,' and then work your way up into a doctorate-level over time.""Huang’s insights into his AI habits came in response to a question from Zakaria about AI's potential impact on cognitive skills. Zakaria cited an MIT study that suggested using tools like ChatGPT for writing tasks ""came at a cognitive cost"" to participants.While Huang admitted he hadn't reviewed the MIT research, he firmly believes his ""cognitive skills are actually advancing"" despite using AI ""literally every single day.""He challenged the notion that AI use leads to a decline in critical thinking: ""I'm not exactly sure what people are using it for that would cause you to not have to think, but you have to think.""“When I'm interacting with AI, it's a questioning system. You're asking it questions. In order to formulate good questions, you have to be thinking. You have to be analytical. You have to be reasoning yourself,” he said.Huang isn't alone among tech leaders in integrating AI into daily work. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also revealed in a May Bloomberg interview that he uses Microsoft Copilot for tasks like summarising emails and preparing for meetings.","Jensen Huang says he uses multiple AI chatbots to get the best answers.

How a 3 am email helped Android head Sameer Samat land a job at Google,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-a-3-am-email-helped-android-head-sameer-samat-land-a-job-at-google/articleshow/122502018.cms,"How Google co-founder helped even after rejecting Brin's offer

CEO Sundar Pichai's personal call brought Samat back to Google

Google's head of Android , Sameer Samat , credits a middle-of-the-night cold email to Google cofounder Sergey Brin in 1999 as the pivotal moment that shaped his entire career trajectory. The impromptu message, sent at 3 AM during a heated dispute with his startup cofounders about pursuing graduate school, led to an immediate job offer and long-term mentorship that would eventually bring him to lead one of the world's most influential mobile platforms.""A couple of them were on to go to grad school, and we had a big fight about it,"" Samat told Business Insider. ""I said, 'I don't understand how you can want to go to grad school; we're building this company.'""Samat, then in his early 20s running a machine-learning startup called Mohomine during the dot-com boom, reached out to Brin asking: ""What would you do in this situation? I'm sure you had this wrestle with this grad school decision."" Despite not knowing Brin personally, Samat had studied his research papers and respected Google's work. Remarkably, Brin responded within minutes, inviting Samat to Google's offices for an impromptu interview that same day.Though Samat declined Brin's initial job offer to stay loyal to his cofounders, the Google cofounder went above and beyond to help. ""He didn't have to do any of that,"" Samat told Business Insider. ""And so I try to pay that forward, too, when people call me up with something similar.""Brin advised Samat on securing proper financing and introduced him to investors who eventually funded his startup. According to Business Insider, Samat later sold Mohomine to Kofax , now known as Tungsten Automation , before joining Google in 2008.The experience taught Samat valuable lessons about operating with limited resources as a founder, skills that proved crucial when he eventually joined Google. ""There is no substitute for taking a pretty good plan and just running like hell,"" he explained. He initially led Google Shopping before transitioning to oversee the Android ecosystem.After leaving Google in 2015, Samat received a personal call from newly appointed CEO Sundar Pichai asking him to return. Pichai, whom Samat described as a ""work big brother"" and trusted advisor, specifically requested his help with Android and Google Play.""When he asked if I would come back to work with him on Android and Google Play, it was an easy decision,"" Samat said. ""It was a call that you don't get often in"" your career.Today, Samat advocates for entrepreneurial risk-taking over extensive academic preparation. ""Sometimes the naiveness of someone who doesn't have that background makes a much better entrepreneur,"" he said, noting that the decision to ""do your own thing"" and follow what excites you is most important.","Google's head of Android credits a middle-of-the-night cold email to Google cofounder Sergey Brin as the pivotal moment that shaped his career trajectory.

How AI gets smart: Unlocking LLMs

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban an advocate of artificial intelligence has now issued a warning about AI. The billionaire revealed that he uses AI for ‘everything’ ranging from writing code and monitoring his health to creating video content. However, despite its benefits, the billionaire warns about the AI’s most significant dangers and emphasise on the importance of human supervision. Cuban cautioned that the technology’s unpredictability and potential misuse is highly possible.As reported by CNBC, speaking at the High Performance podcast, Cuban revealed that he uses AI for almost everything today. Cuban said that he uses AI to write codes with the help of the Replit app. “It’s insane how much I use it right now. I downloaded this app, Replit, and you just type in ... I want to be able to compare pharmacy costs between my company and these other companies, and every time the price changes send me alerts,” said Cuban.Additionally, he also takes help of AI in making text-to-video content for the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks as he’s the monitor owner on the team. And he also uses AI to monitor his health regularly. “I just [went to ChatGPT] and I was like ... I’m going to tell you when I take my medicine and when I do my workout, and I want you to record it all. If there’s something there that I write down that you think is not right or I should be concerned about, let me know,” added Cuban.Cuban also emphasised on the potential dangers of using AI. “Yes, it’s true. The biggest danger of AI is real,” said Cuban. A primary concern he voices is the phenomenon of ""hallucinations,"" where chatbots generate fabricated or incorrect information.“You’ve got to be careful ... It’s like talking to a friend who you think knows a lot about something. You’ve still got to be careful and talk to an expert,” said Cuban.He advise the users to use AI with caution and skepticism. He also tells users to fact-check all the responses and work on prompt-engineering in order to make the most of AI. He believes that AI can propose millions of solutions in a second but human judgment is still indispensable.Recently, Billionaire Mark Cuban predicted that the world's first trillionaire will be an entrepreneur who develops a successful artificial intelligence innovation. During an appearance on the ""High Performance"" podcast, Cuban made this prediction.In the podcast, Cuban said: “The technology is changing so quickly. Somebody will come up with a new way to utilise it in a way we never thought about before. But AI just drawfs all that. We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what’s its going to be able to do. And not only do I think it will create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in a basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”",Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has issued a warning about AI.

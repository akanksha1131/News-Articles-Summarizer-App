“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

Rene Haas on cultural divide in semiconductor industry



“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right? And in Taiwan, if you say you're working for TSMC or studying to go off and do that, it's a highly prestigious kind of thing,”





Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry. The chief executive of the UK-based semiconductor and software design company stated that once a company falls behind in the semiconductor industry, recovery is an uphill climb. In a recent All-in Podcast, Haas, while commenting on the debate about whether Intel could serve as a viable US-based alternative to the Taiwanese chip manufacturer, said thatHe also pointed out the opportunities that the US-based chip maker missed, explaining why all the leading companies like Apple and Nvidia are flocking to build from TSMC.At the podcast, Haas said:Haas explained.In addition, Haas noted cultural differences in how manufacturing is viewed, stating that while such jobs are respected in Taiwan, they are often perceived as less appealing in the West, which could impact the long-term stability of US manufacturing.he noted.","Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry.

SpaceX issues 'road closure' notice





Starbase, the SpaceX company town at the southern tip of Texas, has been granted authority over a stretch of Boca Chica Beach, marking a significant expansion of its control over the area surrounding the company’s rocket launch site. On September 25, Cameron County commissioners approved an agreement transferring oversight of beach access and dune protection along approximately two miles of coastline to Starbase, a move that underscores the growing influence of Elon Musk ’s space venture.The decision follows a standing order from the Texas Space Commission, which last month empowered Starbase to manage closures of Boca Chica Beach and Texas State Highway 4 during SpaceX activities, including launches and testing of its massive Starship rocket. Previously, Cameron County officials, led by the county judge, held this authority, most recently approving closures for ground testing in September. The new order shifts that power to Starbase, allowing the city to make closure decisions to support “space flight activities and aeronautics economic development.”Starbase exercised its new authority this week, issuing a notice this week for a “road closure” on October 9 to move a Starship rocket to its launch pad ahead of a planned test flight on Monday, October 13.The flight will mark the 11th test of Starship, SpaceX’s ambitious rocket designed for deep space missions. Once fully operational, SpaceX aims to launch Starship from Starbase up to 25 times annually.Under the agreement with Cameron County, Starbase will enforce Texas’ Open Beaches Act, ensuring public access to the beach, while managing a beachfront construction and dune protection permitting program. The city will oversee construction in the area, establish protected dune zones, and install signs and barriers to prevent trespassing, all in compliance with state regulations.The transfer of authority has raised questions about the balance between public access and the needs of SpaceX’s operations, as Starbase’s control over the beach and surrounding infrastructure grows. With October 13's SpaceX test flight approaching, all eyes are on Starbase as it navigates its new role in managing one of Texas’ coastal treasures.","Starbase, the SpaceX company town at the southern tip of Texas, has been granted authority over a stretch of Boca Chica Beach.

The Trump Administration has intensified its crackdown on Chinese technology companies, expanding export restrictions to include subsidiaries of companies already on the US Department of Commerce’s entity list. The move, aimed at closing a significant loophole in existing sanctions, has sparked sharp criticism from Beijing as tensions in the US-China technology race continue to mount. The new rule targets major Chinese tech players, including Huawei, memory chip giant YMTC, and drone manufacturer DJI, by extending restrictions to any subsidiary at least 50% owned by a listed company.The Commerce Department said the change, effective immediately, could impact tens of thousands of entities and is designed to prevent sanctioned firms from funneling restricted technologies through their subsidiaries.“This action closes a significant loophole that has enabled exports undermining American national security and foreign policy interests,” said Jeffrey I. Kessler, Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security.The expanded controls cover critical technologies, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, advanced robotics, and related manufacturing equipment, as well as entities on the “Military End-User list” to prevent dual-use items from supporting military applications.While the rule does not explicitly single out China, Chinese and Russian firms dominate the entity list, primarily for their roles in advancing military technologies.China’s Ministry of Commerce swiftly condemned the move as “extremely malicious,” with a spokesperson vowing to “take necessary measures” to protect Chinese companies. “Beijing urges Washington to immediately correct its wrongdoing and stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese firms,” the spokesperson said.The escalation comes weeks before an anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea, injecting fresh uncertainty into the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. The U.S. has already restricted over 1,000 Chinese firms deemed risks to national security or foreign policy, requiring them to obtain licenses for exporting certain products or technologies.Concerns about subsidiaries evading restrictions have long troubled U.S. policymakers. A 2023 House Foreign Affairs Committee report labeled the entity list “ineffective,” citing cases like Huawei’s sale of its smartphone brand Honor to a consortium involving the Chinese government in 2020. Honor has not been blacklisted, raising fears of circumvention through corporate restructuring.The Commerce Department’s policy document accompanying the announcement highlighted risks of “diversionary schemes,” such as creating new foreign entities to bypass restrictions. While the rule took effect immediately, some companies were granted a 60-day exemption period.The move underscores Washington’s growing alarm over China’s rapid advancements in chip and AI technologies, which prompted Huawei’s blacklisting in 2019 and subsequent restrictions on hundreds of other firms. As the U.S.-China tech rivalry intensifies, analysts warn that the expanded controls could further strain bilateral relations and disrupt global supply chains.","US expands export restrictions to include subsidiaries of companies already on the US Department of Commerce’s entity list.

Apple's lobbying push failed to stop the law





Starting January 1, 2026, Apple will require anyone creating a new Apple Account in Texas to confirm whether they're over 18, marking a significant shift in how the company manages underage users. Minors will be locked into Family Sharing groups, giving parents and guardians approval rights over every app download, purchase, and in-app transaction.Apple announced the changes while voicing sharp concerns about the privacy trade-offs involved. The company warned that Texas' App Store Accountability Act forces users to hand over ""sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.""Apple is throwing developers a lifeline with updated compliance tools. The company's Declared Age Range API, set for an upgrade in the coming months, will let apps verify age categories without demanding actual birthdates. New APIs launching later this year will trigger system-level prompts when apps undergo major changes, letting users request fresh parental consent while giving parents the power to pull the plug on access.Every developer shipping iOS and iPadOS apps in Texas must retool their software to meet the law's requirements. Utah and Louisiana are queuing up similar rules for later in 2026, broadening the impact beyond the Lone Star State.Apple didn't go down without a fight. CEO Tim Cook personally rang up Texas Governor Greg Abbott trying to kill the legislation, but Abbott signed it into law anyway in May 2025. The company had argued that patchwork state regulations would bulldoze user privacy across the board.Anticipating the regulatory wave, Apple rolled out beefed-up child safety features earlier this year, including revamped age ratings and streamlined parental controls. Still, the company insists these opt-in protections beat forced age checks that sweep up every user, regardless of what apps they're after.","Apple will require anyone creating a new Apple Account in Texas to confirm whether they're over 18.

The AI arms race meets physics





Engineers are embedding synthetic diamonds into computer chips to combat the massive energy waste plaguing data centers, as companies rush to build infrastructure for artificial intelligence models that consume electricity at unprecedented rates.More than half of all energy in chips is wasted as heat leaking from transistors, according to R. Martin Roscheisen, an electrical engineer at Diamond Foundry. This heat shortens chip lifespans, reduces efficiency, and forces data centres to spend enormous resources on cooling systems. Now, researchers are turning to an unlikely material to solve this crisis: diamond.Diamond conducts heat several times faster than copper, the material traditionally used in chip cooling systems, notes Paul May, a physical chemist at the University of Bristol. The secret lies in diamond's atomic structure—each carbon atom bonds strongly to four neighbours, creating efficient pathways for heat to travel through the crystal.Companies are now manufacturing diamond layers specifically for chip cooling. Diamond Foundry grows four-inch synthetic diamond disks using carbon-rich plasma, then polishes them to atomic smoothness—no defect larger than a single atom across the entire surface.These wafers attach directly to chips, eliminating hot spots that plague conventional designs.Element Six, the industrial division of diamond giant De Beers, has developed a copper-diamond hybrid that balances performance with affordability. The material targets next-generation AI chips that generate unprecedented heat loads, potentially extending their lifespans while slashing cooling costs, the company's business development head Bruce Bolliger told the Times.The urgency has intensified as chipmakers hit physical barriers in shrinking transistors. Srabanti Chowdhury, an electrical engineer at Stanford University, is exploring diamond layers to enable vertical transistor stacking—a promising approach that generates even more problematic heat.Her research, partly funded by DARPA, focuses on growing diamonds at temperatures low enough not to damage silicon foundations. ""The problem of heat was already there, but now that the growth really came with A.I., it's like a hockey stick,"" Chowdhury told the Times.Within a few years, even home computers and mobile phones will likely include diamond heat-spreaders, according to Dr. May. However, the technology hasn't yet proven itself commercially, and researchers continue working to make production more affordable and scalable for mass-market applications.","Diamond conducts heat several times faster than copper, the material traditionally used in chip cooling systems.

What US law firm Williams & Connolly said about the cyberattack



“During the incident, a small number of Williams & Connolly attorney email accounts were accessed by leveraging what is known as a zero-day attack.

Importantly, there is no evidence that confidential client data was extracted from any other part of our IT system, including from databases where client files are stored. We have taken steps to block the threat actor, and there is now no evidence of any unauthorized traffic on our network.

“Based on the firm’s investigation, conducted in conjunction with cyberexperts at CrowdStrike, the threat actor is believed to be affiliated with a nation-state actor responsible for recent attacks on a number of law firms and companies,”

“Since March 2025, Mandiant Consulting has responded to intrusions across a range of industry verticals, most notably legal services and software companies. Based on evidence from recent investigations, the targeting of the U.S. legal space is primarily to gather information related to U.S. national security and international trade.”





FBI is investigating a large-scale cyber espionage effort by Chinese hackers. These hackers successfully infiltrated the computer systems of one of the country's most prominent law firms, Williams & Connolly, a report claims. The firm has reportedly notified clients that its networks were compromised as part of a broader, sustained Chinese campaign targeting American legal practices. The FBI's Washington field office is leading the investigation into the breach at Williams & Connolly and several similar attacks. Federal authorities suspect the same group of Chinese state-sponsored hackers is responsible for compromising the networks of more than a dozen other law firms and tech companies in recent months.According to a report by the New York Times, the information regarding the infiltration and the subsequent federal investigation was provided by two individuals briefed on the matter. These sources requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of an ongoing federal investigation.In a statement to the NYT, the company responded to questions about the hack and said:Williams & Connolly, known for taking a strong stance in legal battles with the government, represents several well-known American politicians, including Bill and Hillary Clinton.In recent days, the firm has sought to reassure clients, stating that, to its knowledge, the hackers do not intend to release or sell the information they have obtained. The company informed its clients that some lawyers’ email accounts had been compromised and that the attackers may have accessed certain client communications.Williams & Connolly has brought in cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and law firm Norton Rose Fulbright to help address the consequences of the breach.the law firm noted.Last month, cybersecurity firm Mandiant reported that Chinese hackers had been running a long-term espionage campaign using zero-day vulnerabilities to gather intelligence from organisations such as law firms.In its September report, the company said:","FBI is investigating a large-scale cyber espionage effort by Chinese hackers.

At just 30 years old, Lucy Guo has joined the ranks of billionaire college dropouts like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, amassing a $1.25 billion net worth, according to Forbes. Guo’s meteoric rise came after her first company, Scale AI, was acquired by Meta in a deal valuing the AI data labeling firm at $29 billion, CNBC reported. Guo, now the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022, shared with 'CNBC Make It' that she veered from the traditional path of higher education. After studying computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, Guo left the program just two years in, with only one year and eight classes left to graduate. The decision stunned her Chinese immigrant parents.“They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,” Guo told CNBC Make It. “For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.” “I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them, and they weren’t very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself,” she said.Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship, a program by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that awards $200,000 to young entrepreneurs to build innovative companies. “I think [my parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them,” Guo said. “It was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future.” Despite her unconventional path, Guo sees value in college for its networking opportunities.“One to two years in college is actually just incredibly great because you’re going to make the best friends in college, and you’re going to meet the smartest people,” she told CNBC Make It. “There’s no other scenario where there’s such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.”Guo noted that unlike workplaces or social events, where people may already have established circles, college offers a unique environment for building lifelong connections. Her story underscores a growing trend of entrepreneurs prioritizing real-world experience over traditional education, while still recognizing the social benefits of a campus environment.","Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform.

Full text of Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Arattai is on the surface a simple product but it has a lot of depth inside.

Let me list the engineering frameworks (all homegrown) that power Arattai.

First is what we call our messaging/AV framework. This has been the ""real time"" workhorse of Zoho for a while and this is what offers you those crisp calls and meetings that connect quickly. It has been perfected for 15 years.

Then we have a distributed framework that allows us to distribute the workload among many servers and databases, and provides fault tolerance, performance monitoring, security and so on. This is the backbone of Zoho and powers a lot of what you see on the surface and also keeps our systems secure. We have been perfecting this for over 20 years now!

We have teams actively working on these frameworks and they provide strong support to the Arattai team.

Our staying power comes from the depth of all the R&D we do. Recently I have moved full time to R&D and you will see many more innovations from us.





Zoho founder and former CEO Sridhar Vembu recently said that being a dedicated engineer is like being a Rishi. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu highlighted that the company’s recently launched messaging platform – Arattai may see a “simple product” on the surface, but “has a lot of depth inside”. Praising the Arattai team, he wrote “all of you have worked hard for over 5 years without expecting that the product would ever take off.” “Allow neither praise nor criticism nor fame to distract you, resolutely stay the course,” Vembu added.In the post, he also shed light on the engineering framework that power Arattai.

"Lawsuit filed against Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee hike, 4 biggest complaints it makes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lawsuit-filed-against-donald-trumps-100000-h-1b-visa-fee-hike-4-biggest-complaints-it-makes/articleshow/124307279.cms,"H-1B restrictions are backfiring: Here’s how India became the new innovation hub

Here's the press release on the lawsuit by the organisation:

* Defies Congress:

* Invites chaos and favoritism:

* Hurts communities nationwide:

* Undermines the economy:

What Trump's H-1B visa fee order says





A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump ’s executive order increasing H-1B visa fee. The lawsuit claims the increase in visa fee to the anti-immigration power grab: A sweeping executive action that slaps an unlawful new $100,000 price tag on every new H-1B application. As per the press release issued by the association, the proclamation has already thrown employers, workers, and federal agencies into chaos. Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO), Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation.The H-1B visa program was created by Congress to provide a critical path for the United States to attract highly skilled professionals from around the world to fill urgent needs in the economy and public services to strengthen American innovation. Under the program, U.S. employers can hire qualified foreign talent — such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, and researchers — after a rigorous review process.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the order as unconstitutional and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs include Global Nurse Force; Global Village Academy Collaborative; Society of the Divine Word; the Fathers of St.Charles; Church on the Hill; International Union; United Auto-Aerospace Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW International); UAW Local 4811; American Association of University Professors (AAUP); Committee of Interns and Residents, SEIU (CIR), a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in the Appalachia region, and a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California.These plaintiffs represent medical residents, fellows, interns, and nurses serving rural and medically underserved communities, a school that relies on H-1B workers to serve their students, religious organizations that depend on the H-1B program to hire pastors and religious professionals that minister to underserved communities, major labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals and higher education members, and individual highly skilled workers whose careers and lives were upended overnight.When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, entire communities lose — patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create.The complaint details how the sudden $100,000 demand:The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The President cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation.The order offers a vague “national interest” loophole with no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.Rural hospitals warn they will be unable to keep needed doctors and nurses; schools say the unlawful fee is more than many teacher salaries; and nonprofit organizations and research institutions can’t absorb the significant expense. All will lose if they cannot utilize H-1B workers.Economists agree that H-1B workers create U.S. jobs and drive new industries. Forcing talent away means companies move operations—and good jobs—overseas. Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators.The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.In its order, Trump administration argued that the H-1B visa system was being abused to replace American workers with people willing to work for less money. The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system. India accounts for around three-quarters of the recipients.","A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump ’s executive order increasing H-1B visa fee.

Microsoft frees up CEO Satya Nadella from some duties; read Nadella's email to employees company-wide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-frees-up-ceo-satya-nadella-from-some-duties-read-nadellas-email-to-employees-company-wide/articleshow/124272687.cms,"Google Photos AI Update: Hands-Free Photo Editing

Here's CEO Satya Nadella's email to Microsoft employees on the restructuring:

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the “number one seed” in the industry and our company’s most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Satya

SoftBank Group has reached an agreement to acquire the robotics business of Swiss engineering group ABB in a deal valued at $5.4 billion. The acquisition, announced on Wednesday (October 8), marks the latest move by SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son to integrate robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), advancing what Son refers to as the company’s “next frontier: Physical AI. ”According to news agency Reuters, the deal is a significant development for both firms. For SoftBank, it solidifies its push into the AI sector, adding to massive investments including a $40 billion funding round in OpenAI , and the $6.5 billion purchase of chip design company Ampere in March.SoftBank had previously scaled back its ambitions after an initial push into humanoid robotics a decade ago with its Pepper robot, the report added.The decision to sell the robotics division, which competes with rivals like Japan's Fanuc and Germany's Kuka in factory robots, is the first major move under ABB CEO Morten Wierod, who took charge last year. It follows years of struggling sales and falling profitability within the robotics unit.ABB's robotics division employs 7,000 people and generated $2.3 billion in sales last year, accounting for 7% of ABB's total revenues.Wierod told the news agency that while the company had initially planned to spin off and separately list the robotics business, it opted for the SoftBank sale due to the immediate cash proceeds.The transaction is expected to close in mid- to late-2026 and will generate cash proceeds of approximately $5.3 billion for ABB.CEO Wierod stated that the money will be dedicated to developing new technology, expanding production capacity in its core focus areas of electrification and automation, and potentially funding new acquisitions.","SoftBank Group has reached an agreement to acquire the robotics business of Swiss engineering group ABB in a deal valued at $5.4 billion.

Salesforce has told its customers it will not pay hackers who are demanding ransom money after they claimed to have stolen large amounts of client information. The cloud software giant has sent a security alert on Tuesday (October 7) informing customers that a hacking group called ShinyHunters is planning to publish data stolen earlier this year, Bloomberg reported, citing an email sent to clients.A Salesforce spokesperson made the company's position clear: they will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands from the hackers. Salesforce also said that it has received “credible threat intelligence” about the hacking group's plans and is staying in contact with affected customers to provide support.The security incident didn’t involve Salesforce's main platform directly. Instead, hackers targeted a third-party app called Drift, made by SalesLoft Inc., which connects with Salesforce to automate customer service tasks. Through this app, hackers managed to steal data from multiple organisations using Salesforce earlier in the year.What data is claimed to have been stolenAccording to Salesforce's email, the hackers appear to have combined stolen records from the Drift app into one large dataset, which was posted for sale on a cybercrime forum last week. The breach, which first came to light in September, primarily exposed:Last month, Salesforce disabled all connections between its platform and SalesLoft technologies, including the Drift app, and last week, the stolen data appeared for sale on a cybercrime forum.",Cloud software giant says it will not pay hackers demanding ransom money.

AI’s surging demand meets power constraints



Jeff Bezos’ prediction on data centres







Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell has said that while the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power is currently “tremendous,” the construction of new AI data centres will eventually hit a saturation point. The comments from Dell come days after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that humans will start building ‘these giant gigawatt data centres in space’.“I’m sure at some point there’ll be too many of these things built, but we don’t see any signs of that,” Dell said during CNBC's ""Closing Bell: Overtime.”The hardware maker’s server networking business has seen significant growth, expanding by 58% last year and climbing 69% last quarter, according to the company. Dell's AI servers, which are powered by Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chips, are sold to major customers including cloud provider CoreWeave and Elon Musk’s startup, xAI.Despite the surging sales—Dell expects to ship $20 billion worth of AI servers in fiscal 2026, doubling last year's figure—the critical constraint facing the industry is energy supply. Dell confirmed that securing sufficient power is a major hurdle for his customers, including OpenAI.“It’s the clear constraint that we hear about from our customers... Many customers, in fact, will tell us, ‘Well, don’t deliver it until this day because we won’t have power in the building to support it’"", he noted.“At the end of the day, if you’re going to generate tens of trillions of tokens, and you’re going to create intelligence and drive the economy forward, you’re going to need computing power and energy,” Dell concluded.Recently, Bezos said that humans will make data centres in space because of uninterrupted solar power without the interference of other factors like weather.“We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centers in space in the next couple of decades,” Bezos said.“Space will end up being one of the places that keeps making Earth better. It already has happened with weather satellites. It’s already happened with communication satellites. The next step is going to be data centers and other kinds of manufacturing,” he added.","Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell says demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power is currently ‘tremendous’ The construction of new AI data centres will eventually hit a saturation point, Dell said.

Ford's human resources director has publicly acknowledged the automaker's failure to properly manage its return-to-office email communications, after compliant employees received threatening termination warnings due to system errors.Homer Isaac, HR director for Ford's Enterprise Technology division, admitted during a September 9 all-hands meeting that the company had ""failed"" in its attempt to modify automated warning emails that incorrectly flagged employees who were actually following workplace attendance policies, according to a recording reviewed by Business Insider.""The communications are standard, and I will pledge to this team, we have asked for those to be changed or modified — we have failed in that,"" Isaac said, acknowledging that workers ""doing the things that you were supposed to"" had been ""caught up in a lot of that noise.""The confusion stems from Ford's June announcement requiring employees to work on-site four days a week starting September 1. Since then, multiple employees have received automated emails warning of ""discipline up to and including termination"" for insufficient badge-ins—despite meeting attendance requirements and having approved remote work arrangements, three current and former employees told Business Insider.One former Ford employee said they continued receiving threatening emails even after complying with the three-day-a-week requirement and securing senior management approval for their remote working arrangement. ""Flexibility is a two-way street,"" the employee said, noting that workers are now less willing to accommodate cross-timezone work outside normal hours.The policy rollout has been rocky.

Europe’s defense tech investment gets boost







A leading European tech investor has said that the region needs to urgently develop its own space capabilities instead of relying heavily on American companies. According to a report by The Financial Times, Bernard Liautaud, a senior partner at Balderton Capital—the investment firm behind tech companies like Revolut—warned that Europe is becoming ""too dependent"" on the US for space technology, particularly Elon Musk-led SpaceX He said this dependence creates a “huge risk” for Europe and stressed that “we need to be more self-sufficient.” According to Liautaud, future battles for ""military supremacy"" will increasingly take place in space, not just on land, sea or air.However, he pointed out that SpaceX has become the “dominant force” in launching satellites and providing space-based communications. This leaves Europe vulnerable in a critical area of defense and technology, he added.European investment in defense technology startups has surged dramatically this year. The increase follows NATO countries boosting their military spending after the Russia-Ukraine war, the report said.This spending boom has sparked the creation of dozens of new companies developing military technologies including drones, battlefield software, and other defense systems.However, Liautaud argues that Europe needs to do much more to build its own capabilities for launching satellites and creating space-based defense systems.Meanwhile, Suranga Chandratillake, another Balderton partner, said that investing in defense companies demands a unique approach to risk management.""Twenty-five years ago, when trying to solve these problems, Europe would have been one of the last places to turn to startups. Today, startups are a key part of the solution,” Chandratillake explained.This shift marks a significant change in how European governments view young tech companies—no longer seen as too risky or inexperienced, but as essential partners in building modern defense capabilities.","Leading European tech investor says Europe needs to develop its own space capabilities.

FAA warns of system-wide impact



Controllers working without pay



Travelers face uncertainty







As the US government shutdown enters into the eighth day, its ripple effects are hitting the nation’s skies. According to a report by CNN, the air traffic controller (ATC) staffing shortages worsening, pilots at several airports across the country are stroking to using Commin Traffic Advisory frequency (CTAF) which is a kin of aviation ‘chat line’ in order to coordinate takeoffs and landings themselves.As reported by CNN, major airpots including Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and Nashville are witnessing delays and disruptions due to reduced ATC staffing. In some cases, approach and departure facilities have been closed temporarily. Due to this situation the pilots are forced to depend on peer-to-peer radio communication to safely manage the airspace.At the Nashville International Airpot, the approach facility was shut down for approximately five hours on Tuesday night with flights rerouted through a regional control center in Memphis. One of the busiest airpots in the country — Chicago O’Hare also operated with reduced number of controllers for about nine hours causing average ground delays of 41 minutes.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not yet triggered formal flight caps at affected airports. FAA has acknowledged that the shortage of staff is causing delays nationwide. As per FlightAware, more than 6000 flights delays were reported Monday as compared to around 3,000 on Saturday.In Huston, both Hobby and George Bush International airports are facing ground delays. On the other hand, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Dallas, and Newark are also operating with limited ATC coverage.The air traffic controllers are considered as essential workers and are required to work during the shutdown without any pay. The strain is starting to show as some of the controllers are reportedly calling out sick, further exacerbating the staffing crises.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) is working with the FAA to tackle these disruptions but the situation is still fluid and unpredictable.Passengers are the real sufferers in this situation. For passengers, the shutdown means longer wait times, unexpected delays, and a growing sense of frustration. With no resolution in sight from Congress, the aviation system is under increasing pressure—and pilots are stepping up to fill the gaps. As one controller put it during a tower closure in Burbank, “Clearance is closed. Ground’s closed. Local’s closed. The tower is closed due to staffing. You just contact SoCal on the 1-800 number in the green book for your clearance”","Major airpots including Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and Nashville are witnessing delays and disruptions due to reduced ATC staffing.

Microsoft won’t allow users anymore to skip Microsoft account setup while installing Windows 11. The software giant is actively removing additional methods that will allow users to create a local account and bypass the mandatory Microsoft account requirement during the Windows 11 installation process. This change signals the company’s intent to enforce the use of online accounts for setting up new devices. The removal of these account-creation workarounds was introduced in the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26220.6772 (KB5065797), released to Insiders in the Dev Channel. This inclusion in the testing track suggests that the removal of these local account options will be implemented in the official production build of Windows 11 in the coming days.Microsoft justifies this decision by stating that bypassing the online account setup leaves devices not beingThis reasoning underscores the company's push toward a setup process that integrates users with Microsoft's cloud services from the start.In a blog post, Microsoft executive Amanda Langowski wrote:After the update goes into effect, users will be required to complete the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) with an internet connection and a Microsoft account to ensure their PCs are configured properly.This follows Microsoft’s earlier decision to remove the “BypassNRO.cmd” script from Windows 11, a move the company said was intended to improve the system’s security and overall user experience.According to a report by BleepingComputer, while the script has been removed, the BypassNRO Registry value remains functional for now, allowing users to set up a local account and skip the network connection step.This workaround can still be used by entering specific commands through the Windows Registry Editor, which can be accessed from the command prompt during the installation process by pressing Shift + F10 at the “Let’s connect you to a network” screen, provided the device is disconnected from the internet.However, this method has not been tested yet, and Microsoft may remove it in a upcoming update to maintain consistency and strengthen security in Windows setup.",Microsoft is removing methods that will allow users to create a local account and bypass the mandatory Microsoft account requirement during the Windows 11 installation process.

Self-deportation: A cost-saving strategy?







Billionaire entrepreneur and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has once again started the debate around immigration. Cuban posted a series of posts on social medial platform X (formerly known as Twitter). He shared his thoughts on the immigration policy, healthcare costs and the economic impact of undocumented migrants. His most provocative suggestion? Offering financial incentives for self-deportation. “I got no problem with offering more money for self-deportation. Cheaper to taxpayers. The only humane option so far,” Cuban wrote.Cuban started his commentary by acknowledging the legal complexities of undocumented immigration. “Illegal is illegal. No way around it. But, the data says that they contribute more than they take”, wrote Cuban. He also emphasised that economic studies shows that undocumented immigrants often pay tables, fill about gaps and also contribute to local economics. He challenged the narrative that they are draining on public resources.Cuban also weighed in on state-level autonomy, arguing that states like California should have the right to allocate federal and local resources as they see fit.“You could argue that is what they, like California, voted for. So it should be their choice to make,” he posted.Cuban’s proposal to pay immigrants to voluntarily leave the U.S. echoes recent reports that the Trump administration offered cash stipends to unaccompanied migrant children who agreed to self-deport. The program, confirmed by ICE, targeted minors aged 14 and older, excluding those from Mexico. While Cuban’s idea has drawn criticism from immigration advocates, he framed it as a fiscally responsible and humane alternative to costly enforcement and detention measures.Cuban’s comments come amid ongoing legal challenges to immigration policy. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship, ruling it unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment.","Billionaire entrepreneur and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has once again started the debate around immigration.

USC staff and students voiced concerns against H-1B visa change







The University of Southern California (USC) has advised faculty and staff holding H-1B visas to avoid international travel following new restrictions introduced by the Trump administration. The measures include a $100,000 fee for employers hiring H-1B candidates, effective for new petitions filed after September 21.As reported by the Daily Trojan, the student newspaper of the university, USC said “Out of an abundance of caution, all faculty and staff in H-1B status currently in the U.S. should put international travel plans on hold until they receive further guidance”.“If possible, any faculty and staff in H-1B status who are currently outside the U.S. are strongly recommended to return to the U.S. before the proclamation takes effect,” the advisory statedThe H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields and is widely used by universities and research institutions. According to federal data, USC was approved for 108 H-1B visas for the 2025 fiscal year.Trump’s proclamation cited “systemic abuse of the program,” a “disadvantageous” labor market for American citizens and fewer job opportunities in lower-skill fields as reasons for the increased fee.Faculty and students voiced concerns about the changes. Aisling Kelliher, associate professor of cinematic arts, recalled her own experience on an H-1B visa before obtaining permanent residency.“One of the primary reasons why people come here as well is because of the international reputation of the American education system,” she said as quoted by the Daily Trojan. “It’s a huge opportunity, both to come here as an immigrant and to receive an education, and then also to be able to continue as a researcher and as a teacher within the system that you’ve learned from. ”Yi-Chieh Chiu, a second-year graduate student in computer science from Taiwan, said he was uncertain about the impact of the new policy. “I’m not sure of the impact; I actually have seen news about this,” he said. “Some people say that it’s actually good for us, because [F-1 visa students] have OPT [when] we’re in the U.S.A., so maybe this is a better chance for us. But some say that this is not good for us to work in the U.S.A. in the future, so I’m not sure which one is true.”F-1 visas allow foreign students to stay in the U.S. for their studies. Optional Practical Training (OPT) lets them work for up to 12 months in a field related to their degree. Students who changed from F-1 to H-1B status before Sept. 21 will not be affected by the new fee.","The University of Southern California has advised faculty and staff holding H-1B visas to avoid international travel following new restrictions introduced by the Trump administration.

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is reportedly planing to rollout Aadhaar-based face authentication for high-value financial transactions in order to transform digital security and convince in India’s financial ecosystem. The proposal championed by the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) was discussed at the Global Fintech Fest 2025. As reported by news agency PTI, the senior officials present at the fest highlighted the potential of face-based authentication in simplifying and securing identity verification.As reported by PTI, Abhishek Singh, deputy director of UIDAI, said that face authentication offer a seamless and scalable solution for verifying users in sensitive transactions. Unlike traditional biometric methods that require specialized hardware, face authentication can be performed directly through smartphones—dramatically expanding the device ecosystem from 4 million to over 640 million smartphones in India.“UIDAI is the foundational infrastructure. It’s the only way to surely know who is who,” Singh said, emphasizing the strength of India’s biometric database and the need for multi-factor authentication.If the Aadhaar-based face authentication system is implemented, then it would enable users to authenticate themselves using facial recognition linked to their Aadhar ID. It will also streamline the processes for large financial transfers, investment and other high-value operations. Singh further noted that NPCI is already aligned with the proposed concept and it may also soon announce its formal adoption.Along with this, he also urged the financial institutions and banks to support this initiative, “easiest and quickest way” to confirm identity in a secure manner.UIDAI officials stressed that the authentication framework is tied to secure devices and that face authentication could reduce reliance on OTPs and physical biometric tools.","The proposal was discussed at the Global Fintech Fest 2025.

Emphasizing the financial sector’s reliance on trust, Sankar noted that even minor errors can have significant consequences, making careful oversight essential. He called for “safety by design” in AI deployment to prevent destabilization of markets, payment systems, and consumer confidence. The RBI has already implemented AI tools like MuleHunter.ai to combat fraud, highlighting the technology’s potential when managed responsibly.T Rabi Sankar stressed that AI systems must embed inherent safety checks, transparency, and accountability to avoid risks such as algorithmic bias, the “black box” problem, market volatility from AI-driven trading, and ethical issues like discriminatory profiling. He highlighted that AI should empower individuals, strengthen institutions, and enhance financial system resilience while preventing unintended consequences.The RBI official outlined five pillars for integrating AI safely in finance: trust, ethics, training, technology for good, and togetherness. He emphasized the need for regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation without compromising systemic stability, ensuring AI benefits are harnessed without creating new threats.Sankar also addressed concerns about AI-driven disruption in the job market, noting that historical parallels with transformative technologies suggest impacts on employment will vary, but caution and proactive planning are crucial to mitigate negative effects.Official warnings and guidance from the RBI position responsible AI oversight as critical to safeguarding financial stability while fostering innovation in India’s rapidly expanding fintech ecosystem. Experts say embedding “safety by design” in AI systems is key to ensuring technology remains a force for good rather than a source of risk. As AI continues to evolve, continuous dialogue between regulators, technologists, and society will be essential to balance innovation with safety.","RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar raised concerns about the dual nature of artificial intelligence (AI) at the Global Fintech Fest 2025.

How the new Aadhaar app differs from mAadhaar



New Aadhaar app: Focused on daily use and controlled sharing, showing digital Aadhaar on the phone, family profile management, face-based activation, selective sharing and offline viewing. It prioritises quick, secure presentation and verification.

mAadhaar app: Continues to serve transactional and account functions, downloading the official e-Aadhaar PDF, ordering PVC Aadhaar cards, generating Virtual IDs (VIDs), updating contact details and certain enrolment/update workflows. Users are expected to keep both apps for their respective strengths, where needed.

How to register and set up the new Aadhaar app



Enter Aadhaar: Open the app, select language, and input the 12-digit Aadhaar number you wish to add.

OTP verification: An OTP is sent to the mobile number registered with that Aadhaar. Enter the OTP to proceed.

Face authentication: Complete the in-app face scan as prompted to confirm physical presence. This step activates the profile for offline and verifiable display.

PIN / biometric protection: Set a six-digit security PIN and enable biometric lock (if available) to protect the profile(s) stored on the device.

Add family profiles (optional): If family members share the same registered mobile number, add their Aadhaar numbers to the app (up to five profiles). Each profile requires OTP and face authentication.

Privacy, security and how UIDAI says new Aadhaar protects data

Related FAQs



Do I need both the new Aadhaar app and mAadhaar?

Yes, the new Aadhaar app is optimised for daily presentation, selective sharing and family profile management; mAadhaar remains useful for document downloads, PVC orders and some account management tasks.

Can I add someone else’s Aadhaar to my phone?

You can add family members’ Aadhaar profiles only if those Aadhaar records share the same registered mobile number; each profile still requires OTP and face authentication.

Is the e-Aadhaar PDF available in the new app?

As of the app launch coverage, e-Aadhaar PDF downloads remain a function of mAadhaar and UIDAI’s web portals; the new app focuses on on-phone presentation and selective sharing. Confirm the latest changes on UIDAI’s official website if this has been updated.

Will the app expose my Aadhaar number to merchants or services?

The app supports masked sharing and selective disclosure, so you can choose to share only required fields (for example, name and photo) rather than the full Aadhaar number. Use QR-based verification to limit direct numeric exposure.





The Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) has launched a new Aadhaar mobile application designed to simplify and secure the process of carrying and sharing digital identity for residents. The app is presented as a lightweight, profile-centric digital wallet for Aadhaar: it lets users store and present their Aadhaar details on a smartphone, control what they share, and add multiple family profiles on one device where the profiles use the same registered mobile number. At launch, UIDAI positions the new Aadhaar app as complementary to the existing mAadhaar app (which continues to support document downloads, PVC card orders and certain account management functions).The new app emphasises modern authentication methods, including face authentication, biometric locks, QR-code sharing and offline access for everyday verification, while continuing to rely on established UIDAI safeguards such as OTP verification tied to the Aadhaar-registered mobile number. These features are intended to increase convenience while giving residents more control over how and when their identity is revealed.The new UIDAI Aadhaar app brings the following capability set to smartphones:Download: Install the official “Aadhaar” app from Google Play Store (Android) or Apple App Store (iOS). Verify the developer/publisher is UIDAI.UIDAI’s approach, as explained in launch coverage, combines device-level safeguards with UIDAI authentication controls:","New app is focused on daily use and controlled sharing, showing digital Aadhaar on the phone, face-based activation, selective sharing and offline viewing.

Amazon is building 'Project Rainier'





Microsoft has announced that it has connected massive datacenters in Wisconsin and Atlanta through a high-speed fiber-optic network, creating what it calls the world’s first “planet-scale AI superfactory. ” The new system links the two sites — roughly 700 miles and five states apart — to function as a single, unified computing complex designed specifically for artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional cloud datacenters that host millions of separate applications, Microsoft said the new facilities are built to handle single, large-scale AI workloads that span multiple locations.Each datacenter contains hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs connected through a high-speed network architecture known as an AI Wide Area Network (AI-WAN), allowing them to share processing tasks in real time. The company is also introducing a two-story datacenter design that packs GPUs more densely while reducing latency, supported by a closed-loop liquid cooling system to manage heat and energy use.By linking sites across regions, Microsoft says it can dynamically balance workloads, pool computing capacity, and distribute massive power demands across the electric grid, reducing dependence on energy availability in any one location.The combined system will be used to train and run the next generation of AI models for key partners including OpenAI, France’s Mistral AI, and Elon Musk’s xAI, as well as Microsoft’s own in-house models.The initiative underscores the rapid escalation of AI infrastructure investment among global tech giants. Microsoft spent over $34 billion on capital expenditures last quarter — much of it dedicated to datacenters and GPUs — as part of what it calls a long-term strategy to meet surging AI demand.Today we announced our new Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta, connected with our first Fairwater site in Wisconsin and our broader Azure footprint to create the world’s first AI superfactory.Fairwater exemplifies our vision for a fungible fleet: infra that can serve any workload, anywhere, on fit-for-purpose accelerators and network paths, with maximum performance and efficiency.AI workloads have evolved beyond large-scale pre-training. Today, they encompass fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), synthetic data generation, evaluation pipelines, and more. Fairwater is built to support this full lifecycle:Max density: Fairwater’s two-story design and liquid cooling system lets us place racks in three dimensions and pack them with GPUs as densely as possible, minimizing cable runs and improving latency and effective bandwidth.Fleet: Each Fairwater DC can integrate hundreds of thousands of the latest NVIDIA GPUs into a single coherent cluster. This provides flexible infra that can support the full spectrum of workloads, and ensure no GPU is left unnecessarily idle.And that’s on top of the more than 100,000 GB300s coming online this quarter alone for inference across the rest of our fleet. For us, it’s all about turning every gigawatt into the maximum number of useful tokens. Not every GW is created equal!Planet-scale: Every Fairwater DC will connect through our continent-spanning AI WAN to prior generations of AI supercomputers, forming a truly fungible pool of compute. This enables developers to scale beyond the capacity of a single site and dynamically land workloads on the right infra for their needs.Together, these innovations let us bring together different generations of silicon and AI systems across DCs and geos into a single elastic system that scales seamlessly across training and inference workloadsAnd this elastic AI capacity is all available alongside all the other cloud services (compute, storage, databases, app services) that AI agents and workloads need.This is what we mean when we talk about building a fungible fleet – a single, unified platform that pushes the limits of performance per watt and per dollar.Rivals are racing to keep pace. Amazon is building “Project Rainier,” a 1,200-acre complex of seven datacenters in Indiana, while Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic are making similar multibillion-dollar commitments to AI-focused infrastructure.Some analysts have cautioned that the scale of these investments could resemble a tech bubble if business customers fail to derive meaningful value from AI in the short term. But Microsoft and its peers insist that the demand is sustainable, pointing to long-term contracts and rapid enterprise adoption as proof that the AI boom is far from speculative.","Microsoft has announced that it has connected massive datacenters in Wisconsin and Atlanta through a high-speed fiber-optic network.

"Warren Buffet's final annual letter has message on CEO pay packages, including Elon Musk's; writes: Sought to embarrass CEOs by ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/warren-buffets-final-annual-letter-has-message-on-ceo-pay-packages-including-elon-musks-writes-sought-to-embarrass-ceos-by-/articleshow/125282151.cms,"What Warren Buffet wrote in his letter

Warren Buffet's 'final thoughts' in the 8-page farewell letter

Warren Buffet's 8-page-long letter to shareholders talks about a number of things including his children, successor, age and more. Here are the final thoughts penned by him in the letter:





Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett doesn't seem to be pleased with the ballooning CEO salaries -- running into billions and even trillions (in one case only for now). In his last and final annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffet called out this trend that he called driven by greed and selfishness. This is Warren Buffet's last letter as Berkshire Hathaway CEO before Berkshire vice chair Greg Abel takes over as CEO, starting on January 1, 2026. In the letter, Buffet has warned that corporate greed and envy are fueling an escalating cycle of CEO salaries, as executives compete to outdo one another’s compensation packages.Buffett’s comments come amid fresh debate over executive pay after Tesla shareholders approved a record-breaking $1 trillion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk last week. The payout, contingent on Tesla reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization, would make Musk the world’s first trillionaire. His current net worth stands at about $449 billion. Just a day after Tesla’s vote, electric vehicle rival Rivian unveiled a $4.6 billion, decade-long compensation plan for CEO RJ Scaringe, modeled after Musk’s. The package would double Scaringe’s $2 billion base salary and is tied to operational and cash flow milestones over seven years. Buffet's remarks underscore Buffett’s long-standing skepticism toward runaway executive compensation and his belief that boardrooms have become increasingly insulated from shareholder interests.“What often bothers very wealthy CEOs—they are human, after all—is that other CEOs are getting even richer,” Buffett wrote. “Envy and greed walk hand in hand. And what consultant ever recommended a serious cut in CEO compensation or board payments?”Reflecting on his six decades leading Berkshire, Buffett noted that corporate transparency rules designed to rein in excessive executive pay had instead produced the opposite effect.“During my lifetime, reformers sought to embarrass CEOs by requiring the disclosure of the compensation of the boss compared to what was being paid to the average employee,” he wrote. “Proxy statements promptly ballooned to 100-plus pages compared to 20 or less earlier. But the good intentions didn’t work; instead they backfired.”Buffett said public disclosure led to pay envy rather than restraint, as executives used competitors’ earnings as benchmarks to pressure boards for raises. “Based on the majority of my observations—the CEO of company ‘A’ looked at his competitor at company ‘B’ and subtly conveyed to his board that he should be worth more,” Buffett said. “Of course, he also boosted the pay of directors and was careful who he placed on the compensation committee. The new rules produced envy, not moderation.”One perhaps self-serving observation. I’m happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first. My advice: Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes – learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve. Get the right heroes and copy them. You can start with Tom Murphy; he was the best.Remember Alfred Nobel, later of Nobel Prize fame, who – reportedly – read his own obituary that was mistakenly printed when his brother died and a newspaper got mixed up. He was horrified at what he read and realized he should change his behavior.Don’t count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it. Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.I write this as one who has been thoughtless countless times and made many mistakes but also became very lucky in learning from some wonderful friends how to behave better (still a long way from perfect, however). Keep in mind that the cleaning lady is as much a human being as the Chairman.","Buffet's 8-page-long letter to shareholders talks about a number of things including his children, successor, age and more.

Zoho Corporation founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list, calling it a normal part of business development and dismissing critics as wasting their time. In an interview with ANI, Vembu addressed questions about WhatsApp testing a feature that would allow users to message people on other platforms.“There's nothing going wrong. I think, first of all, the idea that something went wrong is what is wrong. It is a normal course of events. Nothing goes straight to the moon. You have to go through these ups and downs,” Vembu was quoted as saying.He emphasised that companies that survive maintain a long-term perspective.“The trick to companies that survive is they have a long-term view on this. In fact, I never thought The number one is anything big. In fact, I literally told our employees, this is a particular moment, it won't last,” he added.“That's why I simply don't pay attention. And the people who pay attention and making fun of this, they are wasting their time. That's all I'll say. We are not wasting time. I am sitting and we are sitting and focused on code.So I said, don't worry about it,” Vembu noted, pointing out that Zoho views Arattai as a five to 15-year project rather than a short-term venture.Vembu revealed that Zoho has worked on messaging technology for 10 years, making the recent ranking drop insignificant.“Our strategy in all this, the messaging is very core. And we have been working on it for 10 years. So this one month is nothing for us. We will continue this and we have a really strong app. It's getting stronger,” the cofounder was quoted as saying.The company plans frequent updates to improve Arattai. Vembu argued that credible competition is necessary to prevent monopolistic practices in the messaging app market.“If we don't have competition, you can't keep the monopolist honest.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

How the free tier of Xbox Cloud Gaming may work



Games they already own.

Eligible Free Play Days titles (games typically offered for a free weekend trial).

Xbox Retro Classics games.

Xbox’s higher sales targets







Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Tech companies should cover technical cost







Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia , has called on companies like Google and OpenAI to pay for using the encyclopedia’s content to train their large language models (LLMs).

Wales suggested that Wikipedia’s content is a massive part of the training data for all major LLMs. He said that all content is freely licensed for people to use as they pleaseHowever, during an interview with news agency Reuters, he said that the immense traffic generated by AI bots is straining Wikipedia’s resources.“Yeah we're a big part of the training data for all the major LLMs. Everything in Wikipedia is freely licensed for people to do as they please with it,” Wales told the news agency, adding, “We do see that on a more practical level, the AI bots crawling Wikipedia are imposing quite a lot of costs on us.”During the interview, Wales explained the financial logic behind his demand for payment. He noted that the technical cost of serving data to AI companies should be covered by the tech companies working on AI.“We're trying to say, you should use our enterprise product and pay us for your usage,” Wales said.He emphasised that Wikipedia, a non-profit organisation, is funded entirely by public donations. Spending that money to support the infrastructure demands of for-profit tech giants is unsustainable.“It's not really fair to our donors if people are donating to support Wikipedia, but then we're spending our money to support OpenAI and Google and stuff like that,” he added.When asked why Wikipedia does not simply put a hard stop to the AI companies' usage, Wales admitted that while it is a possibility, it is a complex decision.

Microsoft may have a 'gift card plan' to stop Windows users from choosing Google Chrome over Edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-may-have-a-gift-card-plan-to-stop-windows-users-from-choosing-google-chrome-over-edge/articleshow/125277671.cms,"AI generated image for representation

""Redeem your points for gift cards or donate to one of over 2 million nonprofits. Earn 1,300 Microsoft Rewards points by trying Edge.""

“Rather than competing on the merits and letting users decide the best browser for their needs, Microsoft is now bribing users with the promise of Microsoft Rewards points that have real cash value. Microsoft should stand on the side of users instead of expanding its campaign to undermine consumer choice and lock out competing browsers,”





Microsoft is using a promotional strategy to attract users to its Bing search engine, a report claims. The software giant is offering 1,300 Rewards points to encourage Windows users to keep using the Edge browser rather than switching to Google Chrome. According to a report by Windows Latest, when users search for ""Chrome"" on Bing, an ad promoting Microsoft Edge appears. The ad states that users can earn up to 1,300 Microsoft Rewards points, which can be redeemed for gift cards or used to support non-profit organisations. Microsoft's ad notes:The Rewards points can be exchanged for real products through gift cards from retailers like Amazon or used for services like Spotify Premium.This promotional activity is a targeted effort, as similar ads are not appearing for other competing browsers such as Opera, Firefox, or Brave. Microsoft promotes the ads and is an internal effort to boost adoption of its own products.In a statement to Windows Latest, the Browser Choice Alliance, which includes Google Chrome, Midori, Opera, Vivaldi, and Wavebox, confirmed the report’s findings and accused Microsoft of offering incentives to persuade users to choose its browser.Browser Choice Alliance said.Apart from this, Microsoft has been running new ads for its Edge browser on Bing.com roughly every two weeks. As per the report, an ad promoting Edge as a better option that uses the same technology as Chrome, which is Chromium, was also noticed earlier. It appeared when users attempted to download Chrome via Edge.In this case, Microsoft created a Bing ad that appears when someone searches for “Chrome,” stating, “All you need is right here.” The message highlights that Edge uses the same technology as Chrome, assuring users they won’t lose access to websites or features. The ad includes a checklist that positions Edge more favorably.The ad presents Edge as the winner on a comparison scoreboard. For instance, it mentions that users can earn Microsoft Rewards points when using Edge, something not available in Chrome. It also highlights access to a VPN feature, though it doesn’t specify that Cloudflare powers it or that users cannot manually select locations.Microsoft further promotes Edge’s AI personalisation, which lets users create browser themes using prompts, although the customisation is limited. Overall, Microsoft’s campaign appears aimed at convincing users that Edge offers everything they need, emphasising parity with Chrome’s capabilities.","Microsoft is using a promotional strategy to attract users to its Bing search engine.

Hi all,

Before we return to the office (RTO) full time in Los Angeles and New York on January 5, we wanted to provide a few key updates.

First,

individual workspace seating assignments will be shared by mid-December

. In general, most teams will stay in their current areas, although some will be moving floors to ensure that everyone has their own dedicated workspace. We are partnering with senior leaders to plan these changes carefully, taking into account team and business needs.

Second, to prepare our workplace for RTO, we are conducting a

“Clean + Pack” period from November 10–21

at select locations (see the tables below).

Clean + Pack applies to non-production employees in agile workspaces.

Employees with existing dedicated offices/workstations will receive a separate communication with guidance if applicable.







More updates will follow in the coming weeks with details on workspace moves and team-specific guidance, as well as an overview of onsite services, benefit programs, info sessions, and other resources to help you prepare for RTO. If you have questions on RTO or are unsure whether Clean + Pack applies to you, please refer to this RTO FAQ or contact AskHR.



Thank you for your cooperation and support as we prepare to return to the office full time in the new year.



Best,

China has accused the US government of conducting a 2020 cyberattack that resulted in the theft of more than $13 billion worth of Bitcoin. According to a report published over the weekend by China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC), Washington was behind the December 2020 hack that stole 127,272 Bitcoin from LuBian, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency miners.CVERC stated the Bitcoin belonged to Chen Zhi, the Chinese-born Cambodian tycoon and chairman of the Prince Group, according to a report by Nikkei Asia.The accusation, published on CVERC’s official WeChat account, argues that the theft was not the work of a typical criminal organisation. CVERC noted that following the 2020 hack, which occurred in the final days of the first Trump administration, the tokens remained in the attacker's wallet for four years without being moved.“This is clearly not the behaviour of a typical hacker eager to cash out for profits, and more like a precise operation orchestrated by a national hacking organisation,” the CVERC report reads.The accusation directly relates to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) action taken in October. The DOJ indicted Chen Zhi on charges of wire fraud and money laundering, alleging he directed operations at forced labor scam centers across Cambodia under his business empire.At the same time, the DOJ announced the forfeiture of 127,271 Bitcoin, calling it the largest seizure of its kind in history for any country. Notably, the Federal prosecutors in Chen’s case have declined to disclose how they obtained control of the Bitcoin. Since the DOJ announcement, the price of the cryptocurrency has fallen by more than 10%.The allegations come at a time when there are already diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Washington over digital assets, and according to the report, the new accusation adds a new layer of friction to US-China relations Prince Group responded to the indictment and forfeiture in a statement Tuesday, issued via US law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. The company “categorically rejects” accusations of wrongdoing by Chen or the firm and called the forfeiture an “unlawful seizure of assets.” Chen's current whereabouts remain unknown.","China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) claims Washington was behind the December 2020 hack that stole 127,272 Bitcoin from LuBian, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency miners.

Donald Trump has said that the US does not have certain talents and that the citizens need to learn some skills. Speaking in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham about H-1B visa, Trump said “You also do have to bring in talent”. When Ingraham said that the country already had “plenty of talented people here,” Trump responded “no.”“You don’t have certain talents. And you have to, people have to learn. You can’t take people off, like an unemployment line, and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory. We’re going to make missiles,’” Trump added.Trump’s remarks come months after the US administration increased the H-1B visa annual fee to $1,00,000. H-1B visa is one of the widely used by technology companies to bring in workers from other countries. India alone contributed for over 70% of total approved H-1B visa applications in 2024, followed by China.During his second term, Trump has ramped up efforts to crack down on immigration.The $1,00,000 H-1B visa annual fee received flak, including from the US Chamber of Commerce, highlighting the clash between corporate America and Trump’s immigration crackdown.As per a Bloomberg report, employers in the US are now less willing to sponsor work visas for international students. This change affects a common route where many students graduated from American universities and then got jobs with local companies.During his interview with Fox News, Trump cited US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials' raid on under-construction Hyundai plant in Georgia.“In Georgia, they raided because they wanted illegal immigrants,” Trump said, adding “They had people from South Korea that make batteries all their lives. You know, making batteries are very complicated. It’s not an easy thing, and very dangerous. A lot of explosions, lot of problems.”“You can’t just say a country is coming in, going to invest $10 billion to build a plant and going to take people off an unemployment line who haven’t worked in five years, and they’re going to start making missiles. It doesn’t work that way,” Trump said.","Donald Trump has said that the US does not have certain talents and that the citizens need to learn some skills.

New deal and new direction





From constraint to competition





Infrastructure and Safety at the Core





A pivotal moment for Microsoft









Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has revealed that a previous agreement with OpenAI has effectively prevented the tech giant from developing its own artificial intelligence (AGI) models. This restriction has only been lifted recently. Speaking in an interview with Business Insider, Suleyman disclosed that Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI included an important clause which barred Microsoft from independently pursuing AGI until 2030. Suleyman said that this limitation kept Microsoft from building its own frontier models and forced it to focus on smaller-scale AI efforts and post-training OpenAI’s models for specific applications. “Microsoft needs to be self-sufficient in AI,” Suleyman said. “And to do that, we have to train frontier models of all scales with our own data and compute at the state-of-the-art level.”As per the report by Business Insider, the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI has since been renegotiated, granting Microsoft the freedom to pursue AGI independently or with third-party collaborators. This shift has catalysed the formation of a new internal division: Microsoft AI Superintelligence.The team’s mission is to build a “world-class, frontier-grade research capability” and tackle fundamental challenges in AI, such as transfer learning and continual learning — key steps toward developing systems that can teach and evolve like humans.Suleyman’s comments mark a significant departure from Microsoft’s previous strategy, which largely revolved around supporting OpenAI’s GPT models with cloud infrastructure and capital. Now, Microsoft is entering direct competition with OpenAI, as well as other AI leaders like Google, Meta, Anthropic, and xAI.Despite this, Suleyman emphasised a pragmatic approach to model development, saying Microsoft will remain open to using open-source models, Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT, and its own MAI models — whatever best serves its products and customers.“There’s no reason for us to be religious about that,” he said. “We’re very focused on getting our products working.”To support its ambitions, Microsoft is investing heavily in AI infrastructure, including custom chip development and expanded partnerships with Nvidia. Suleyman also confirmed plans for a massive AI chip cluster to reduce reliance on third-party hardware and boost Azure’s performance.The company is also prioritising AI safety and governance, appointing former DeepMind and Google legal executive Trevor Callaghan as VP of Responsible AI. Suleyman stressed that Microsoft aims to be “the adult in the room” as the AI race intensifies.“There’s a risk with these systems that they get extremely smart and run away from us,” he warned. “That requires a humanist intent, which keeps humans at the top of the food chain.”With $300 billion in annual revenue and a vast product ecosystem, Microsoft sees this as a defining moment. Suleyman envisions AI agents embedded across all Microsoft products, transforming workflows and reducing the cost of living for billions over the next decade.“We have the data, we also have the distribution, and we have the user interface,” he said. “So I think it’s just a matter of time before these things become really, really magical.”The revelation underscores a new era for Microsoft — one where it’s no longer just a partner in AI innovation, but a full-fledged competitor in the race to build the future of intelligence.","Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has revealed that a previous agreement with OpenAI has effectively prevented the tech giant from developing its own artificial intelligence (AGI) models.

America companies welcome removal of 'China sanction' list

‘Dumb Trump Can’t…’: Newsom Mocks US President, Calls Him ‘Wannabe Xi’ At COP30 Brazil





The Donald Trump administration has moved to delay a major export control rule targeting Chinese companies, marking one of its key concessions under the latest U.S.–China trade truce. According to a filing published this week in the Federal Register, the so-called “affiliates rule” — introduced in late September to curb shipments to companies majority-owned by blacklisted entities — has been suspended for one year. The decision reportedly follows last month’s meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, where both sides pledged to ease trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.The rule was designed to prevent sanctioned Chinese companies, such as Huawei Technologies., from using subsidiaries to access restricted U.S. technology. Its implementation drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, which labeled it “extremely egregious” and retaliated with export controls on rare-earth minerals critical to global manufacturing.As part of the recent truce, the U.S. agreed to pause the affiliates rule for 12 months, while China committed to delay by a year the expansion of its rare-earth export restrictions — a move that had threatened to disrupt global supply chains.For American technology exporters, the delay represents a welcome reprieve. The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which oversees export controls, said the pause will spare companies from filing roughly 245 additional license applications over the next year. Many firms had warned that enforcing the affiliates rule would have required a costly overhaul of compliance systems.The rule’s effects had already rippled across international markets. In September, Dutch officials sought to assert control over Nexperia, a Netherlands-based chipmaker majority-owned by Wingtech Technology Co., one of the Chinese entities under U.S. sanctions. The dispute prompted Beijing to block chip exports from Nexperia’s Chinese plants, further straining trade relations before the truce.BIS said Monday that a “second phase” of the affiliates rule is scheduled to take effect once the delay ends in November 2026. The agency added that it will continue reviewing the national security and foreign policy implications tied to subsidiaries of restricted entities — signaling that tensions could flare again next year if no further agreement is reached.Supporters of the measure argue that it is essential to closing loopholes that allow blacklisted firms to evade export bans by forming new corporate affiliates. They also note that it would align Commerce Department enforcement with the Treasury Department’s approach to financial sanctions.Still, for now, the year-long suspension offers a temporary detente in the long-running technology and trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.",The 'affiliates rule' was introduced in late September to curb shipments to companies majority-owned by blacklisted entities.

Meta’s AI strategy in flux

Google’s Noam Shazeer as a cautionary tale





Meta’s chief scientist Yann LeCun is reportedly planning to leave the social media company to launch his own startup. LeCun, who is widely known as one of the ""Godfathers of AI,"" is also in early talks to raise funds for his new venture, a report by The Financial Times (via news agency Reuters) claimed, citing people familiar with the matter. Now, in a bold statement Hyperbolic CEO and CTO Yuchen Jin alleged that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was directly responsible for the reported departure of Yann LeCun.In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Jin said that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s actions are responsible for this decision made by the company’s longtime chief AI scientist. The comments made by Jin comes at a time when speculation about internal tensions at Meta are growing.In the social media post, Jin claimed that LeCun’s exit was ‘an outcome’ which became unavoidable after the $15 billion acquisition of ScaleAI and the appointment of Alexandr Wang. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made an investment of $15 billion in AI startup ScaleAI this year. Soon, after the investment he also appointed ScaleAI founder Alexandr Wang to lead Meta’s new “superintelligence” division. As per Jin, the decision of Zuckerberg to According to Jin, Zuckerberg’s decision to have LeCun report to Wang signaled a shift in priorities — away from foundational AI research and toward rapid, product-driven development.“Yann never believed in LLM-to-AGI. Zuck’s patience ran out,” Jin wrote, referencing LeCun’s well-known skepticism of large language models as a path to artificial general intelligence.LeCun, who previously reported to Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, was reassigned under Wang earlier this year. The restructuring reflects Zuckerberg’s urgency to catch up with OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race, especially after Meta’s Llama 4 model failed to match the performance of ChatGPT.Jin suggested that Zuckerberg “panicked” after OpenAI’s success and pivoted Meta’s AI strategy aggressively, sidelining LeCun’s long-term vision in favor of Wang’s fast-paced, LLM-centric approach.Talking about LeCun’s reported exit, Jim drew parallels from Noam Shazeer, the AI pioneer behind Google’s LaMDA, who left to co-found Character.AI. Google later spent $2.7 billion in 2024 to license Character.AI’s technology and bring Shazeer back. Jin hinted that Meta might face a similar reckoning: “Zuck might buy Yann back at a crazy price,” he wrote.Despite the internal shake-up, Wang defended Meta’s trajectory, citing a 105% month-over-month surge in Meta AI visits in October 2025, outperforming competitors like Perplexity and Claude.","Yann LeCun, Meta's chief scientist, is reportedly planning to leave the social media company to launch his own startup.

Google’s former CEO Eric Schmidt has warned that Chinese open-source AI models could dominate globally, creating what he calls one of his “biggest fears” for the future of artificial intelligence. Speaking on the Moonshots podcast released this week, Schmidt said he worries that most countries might end up using Chinese AI models simply because they are free, while U.S. models remain closed and costly.“This produces a bizarre outcome where the biggest models in the United States are closed source and the biggest models in China are open-source,” Schmidt said.“The geopolitical issue there, of course, is that open source is free and the closed source models are not free.”According to Schmidt, this economic gap could have major global implications. “So the vast majority of governments and countries who don't have the kind of money that the West does will end up standardizing on Chinese models not because they're better, but because they're free,” he added.Open-source AI models allow anyone to access, modify, and share the technology, while closed-source systems are proprietary and often more secure but less accessible.The rise of Chinese AI systems like DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen3 this year has already raised concerns around data privacy, national security, and America’s competitive edge in AI.Schmidt said the open vs. closed-source divide could become a geopolitical fault line in the global AI race.The growing debate over “sovereign AI” — a country’s control over its AI technologies, data, and infrastructure — has intensified, with tech leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch urging nations to develop independent systems.Earlier this year, Huang told officials at the World Governments Summit in Dubai that countries must build their own large language models to preserve cultural and technological independence.

In 2009, Jensen Huang offered a glimpse into the future of computing that few could foresee. During an interview, he showcased a compact chip that combines a CPU and GPU, explaining how parallel processing can outperform traditional computing methods. At a time when GPUs were seen mainly as gaming tools, Huang envisioned them as engines for scientific research, simulations, and artificial intelligence. His insights highlighted not only the potential of GPUs but also a philosophy of innovation over competition, with a focus on investing in R&D even amid the global financial crisis. This early vision laid the foundation for Nvidia’s transformation into a global AI powerhouse, with GPUs now powering advanced systems, deep learning models, and autonomous technologies, fulfilling the bold predictions Huang made more than a decade earlier.In the 2009 interview, Huang introduced a compact chip capable of running Windows Vista and handling advanced graphics effortlessly. He described it as a tiny, low-power computer with incredible potential for gaming, scientific simulations, and multimedia applications. This innovative chip contained two processors, a CPU for general computing tasks and a GPU for parallel processing, allowing seamless multitasking and significantly improved performance for complex, graphics-intensive workloads.Huang explained that GPUs could perform tasks far faster than traditional CPUs because they could handle multiple operations simultaneously. He noted that the GPU he was demonstrating had 16 processors capable of 54 gigaflops, fifty-four times faster than the fastest supercomputer available in 1993. At the time, the world saw GPUs mostly as tools for gaming graphics. Huang, however, understood that GPUs could revolutionise computing by enabling complex simulations, scientific research, and eventually artificial intelligence.During the interview, Huang was asked about competing with Intel, which dominated the CPU market in 2009. Rather than focusing on rivalry, Huang emphasised relevance and innovation. He said, “People talk about competition between us and Intel, but we don’t make what they make and they don’t make what we make.”Huang explained that GPUs and CPUs are complementary. The GPU enhances computing power for specific tasks, while the CPU remains essential for overall system operation. He drew a comparison to Microsoft and Google, suggesting that industry progress relies on technological relevance rather than direct competition.This approach highlights Huang’s strategic vision. Instead of trying to challenge Intel head-on, Nvidia focused on innovation in areas where it could excel. This philosophy allowed Nvidia to develop GPUs as the foundation of AI and advanced computing, without getting caught in unnecessary rivalry with other tech giants.Even in the midst of the 2009 global financial crisis, Huang doubled down on research and development. He told Charlie Rose, “I’m going to invest more in R&D this year than last year because I believe in the future of the GPU.”At a time when most companies were cutting budgets, Huang prioritised innovation. His belief in GPUs’ potential illustrates a key principle of visionary leadership: investing in the future even when the present seems uncertain. This commitment to R&D allowed Nvidia to develop GPUs that could handle the increasing demands of AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing. It was a calculated risk that paid off massively over the following decade.Fast forward to 2025, Nvidia’s market capitalisation has exceeded $5 trillion, making it one of the world’s most valuable companies. The GPUs Huang once demonstrated as tiny low-power computers now power AI models such as ChatGPT, autonomous vehicles, and advanced data centres.What began as a small experiment in 2009 has grown into a cornerstone of the AI revolution. Nvidia’s GPUs have enabled breakthroughs in areas ranging from natural language processing to image recognition and scientific simulations. The company’s trajectory shows how early vision, strategic investment, and technological innovation can transform a small idea into a global industry leader. Huang’s 2009 predictions demonstrate more than just foresight, they show leadership and understanding of technological trends. By recognising the potential of GPUs early, he positioned Nvidia to lead the AI revolution. His philosophy of standing on the shoulders of giants underscores the importance of building on past achievements to create future breakthroughs.Today, Nvidia is synonymous with AI computing. GPUs are central to deep learning, neural networks, and data-intensive tasks. Huang’s vision shows that innovation often comes from recognising potential in technologies that others overlook. The small chip he showcased in 2009 is now powering some of the most advanced systems in the world.","In 2009, Jensen Huang showcased a compact chip that combines a CPU and GPU.

""From a short-term perspective, I'll only speak for Microsoft; I can't speak for every company in the industry,"" he told Fortune, acknowledging that different players face different realities in the rapidly evolving landscape.The Microsoft executive pointed to concrete evidence supporting his optimism: the company currently has more customer demand than it can fulfill. ""We have an ongoing pipeline of demand and needs, and we see steady growth, and we're encouraged by where things are going,"" Smith explained. He described capacity expansion as Microsoft's primary challenge, not finding customers willing to pay for AI services.Smith emphasized the delicate balance required as the AI industry matures, urging that all players remain ""thoughtful and disciplined"" while staying ""ambitious but grounded.""He expressed satisfaction with Microsoft's OpenAI partnership and the investments flowing from it, according to Fortune.The reassurances arrive amid troubling financial signals. Microsoft recently wrote down its OpenAI stake in an accounting adjustment implying the ChatGPT maker burned through $12 billion last quarter—even as OpenAI's $250 billion Azure commitment dwarfs its actual revenue generation. The startup's valuation stands at $500 billion, with Microsoft's $13 billion investment representing a 27% stake.Infrastructure providers are also feeling pressure. CoreWeave's stock dropped 6% after third-quarter earnings despite beating revenue expectations, partly because 71% of its income comes from Microsoft—raising sustainability concerns if the tech giant moderates AI spending.Addressing roughly 20,000 attendees in Lisbon's MEO arena, Smith underscored that AI has achieved adoption rates exceeding virtually every prior technology wave, positioning it as ""one of the defining factors of the quarter century ahead.""Smith spotlighted emerging applications demonstrating AI's disruptive potential, including his meeting with Anton Osika, whose startup Lovable empowers anyone to build applications simply by talking to an AI model. ""What they're doing to change the prototyping of software is breathtaking,"" Smith told the audience. ""As much as anything, what these kinds of AI initiatives are doing is opening up technology opportunities for many more people to do more things than they can do before.

LinkedIn cofounder pushes back against calls to slow AI development



AI as tool, not friend: Drawing boundaries on digital companionship







Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, fired back at Pope Leo XIV's call for ethical AI development with a forceful defense of Silicon Valley's approach to artificial intelligence, insisting technology's moral value depends entirely on human choices rather than inherent design.""Technologies are defined as good or bad depending on how they are used,"" Hoffman posted on X on November 9, directly quoting the Pope's message from a day earlier. ""It's upon us, as designers, innovators, builders, investors, and humans, to shape technology for the betterment of humanity.""The public exchange came after Pope Leo XIV addressed participants at the Builders AI Forum 2025, urging AI developers to embed ""moral discernment"" into their work and create systems reflecting ""justice, solidarity, and a genuine reverence for life."" The pontiff had warned that technological innovation carries ""ethical and spiritual weight"" as every design choice expresses a vision of humanity.Hoffman, a prominent Democrat donor who has notably refused to align with President Trump's administration, expanded his argument across multiple posts. He characterized humanity itself as fundamentally technological, writing: ""A thing that makes humans different from all other life on earth—and has allowed us to flourish—is that we continue to build technologies.We are homo techne.""The venture capitalist, whose portfolio includes significant AI investments such as Inflection AI, rejected what he calls the false choice between reckless acceleration and overcautious restraint. ""We should and must keep accelerating, but we should use more than just the gas pedal. We should also use the steering wheel,"" he wrote, dismissing both extreme positions in the AI safety debate.In a recent interview with The Guardian, Hoffman acknowledged his financial interests but defended his credibility. ""I tend to start with my beliefs and follow with my money,"" he told the publication. ""Not kissing [Trump's] ring, like many others have, is probably an economic limiter—but it's better to be principled.""Despite his optimistic outlook, Hoffman has drawn hard lines on certain AI applications. Speaking on the Possible podcast, he strongly opposed marketing AI systems as emotional companions. ""I don't think any AI tool today is capable of being a friend,"" he stated, according to Live Mint. ""And I think if it's pretending to be a friend, you're actually harming the person in so doing.""Hoffman argued that nations embracing AI early will dominate both economically and culturally. ""The countries that adopt the cognitive Industrial Revolution early and firmly will win massive amounts of economic strength, and their values will end up shaping the world,"" he explained, explicitly positioning Western democracies against authoritarian competitors like China.His central message remained defiant: ""It is not 'cringe' to continue to want to build more moral, more abundant societies.""","Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, fired back at Pope Leo XIV's call for ethical AI development.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency





Amazon recently eliminated around 14,000 corporate positions, marking its biggest job cuts since the pandemic-era. Now, it appears that once again the company has fired hundreds of employees. According to a filling on the state’s WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) dashboard, Amazon has laid off 660 employees across nine of its New York City offices. The fresh round of layoffs are said to be the part of company’s ongoing restructuring exercise as it continues to streamline operations and adapt to shifting business priorities.As per the WARN dashboard, the fresh round of layoffs at Amazon has affected employees throughout Manhattan including sites on 7th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and 34th Street. The layoffs were effective as of November 8, 2025 and were disclosed in compliance with New York labor laws, which require advance notice for mass job cuts.Speaking to USA Today, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed the layoffs and said that these job cuts are part of company’s restructuring plan which is aimed at improving efficiency and also alining teams with the company’s long-term goals. However, the company has not yet specified the departments that were impacted because of the recent job cuts.But, it is speculated that the job cuts may have affected corporate roles.Recently, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy clarified that the job cuts are not impacted by AI or aimed to cut costs. Instead, the reason behind Amazon’s 14,000 job cuts is ‘culture’. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Jassy said while speaking at the company’s quarterly earnings call. “It really — it's culture,” he added.“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained during the earnings call.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he continued.“And it can lead to slowing you down.”","Amazon has laid off 660 employees across nine of its New York City offices.

Chinese hacking group identified





Australia’s top intelligence official has accused Chinese state-backed hackers for targeting the nation’s telecommunications and critical infrastructure networks, raising alarms about the potential for cyber sabotage and economic disruption. As reported by Reuters, speaking at a business conference in Melbourne, Mike Burgess, director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) has revealed that the hackers linked to the Chinese government and military have been probing the Australia’s digital backbone. Burgess also revealed that the Chinese hackers are trying to infiltrate water, energy, transport and telecom systems of the country. Burgess said that all these means are part of a broader ‘cyber-enabled sabotage’.“One nation state — no prizes for guessing which one — is conducting multiple attempts to scan and penetrate our critical infrastructure,” Burgess said, without naming China directly but leaving little ambiguity.Burgess estimated that espionage cost Australia A$12.5 billion ($8.1 billion) last year, including A$2 billion in lost trade secrets and intellectual property.He warned that authoritarian regimes are increasingly willing to “disrupt and destroy” rather than merely spy.The report further adds that the Australia organisation has identified two Chinese-linked cyber groups called Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoo involved in this exercise. These groups have also implicated similar kind of attacks on the US infrastructure and are said to operate under the direction of Chinese intelligence and military agencies.Burgess has urged the Australian businesses to strengthen cybersecurity defenses, protect sensitive data, and prepare for potential sabotage scenarios.","Top Australian intelligence official accuses Chinese state-backed hackers for targeting the nation’s telecommunications and critical infrastructure networks.

TikTok, Meta, Snapchat and other social media platforms will start sending alerts to Australian teenagers informing them about deactivation of underage accounts. According to a report by news agency Reuters, these platforms will offer them three choices — download their data, freeze their profiles or lose their accounts — as the world’s first ban on kids under 16 using social media begins on December 10.For Australia’s remaining 20 million social media users — roughly four-fifths of the population — there will be little disruption, the report said. The new law positions Australia as a global leader in youth online safety.Earlier, platform operators had warned of chaotic outcomes, loss of users and possible fines of A$49.5 million ($32 million) for noncompliance. They had argued that mandatory age checks could be invasive or inaccurate.However, companies will mostly rely on existing software that estimates a user’s age based on activity patterns, such as “likes” and interactions, rather than frequent birthdate verifications, Reuters reported.If users believe they have been wrongly blocked, they can appeal through age assurance apps that estimate age using selfies. These tools are being rolled out widely for the first time, though tests showed occasional errors — such as mistakenly approving 15-year-olds or blocking 17-year-olds.“There’ll be a maximum of two to three weeks of people getting to grips with something that they do daily, and then it’s old news,” said Julie Dawson, Chief Policy Officer at Yoti, which provides age assurance for Facebook Instagram and TikTok.Australia passes law to block minors without parental approvalThe law, passed earlier this year, gives platforms until December to block minors without parental discretion. It follows public concern about social media’s impact on young people, amplified by leaked Meta documents in 2021 and the 2024 bestseller The Anxious Generation.TikTok, which told parliament it has 200,000 users aged 13–15 in Australia, said it was developing a feature to report suspected underage users.Locally owned livestreaming platform Kick, which came under scrutiny after a livestreamed death earlier this year, also confirmed it “will be compliant” and plans to “introduce a range of measures.”","World's first ban on kids under 16 using social media begins on December 10.

Apple responds to poor sales and customer feedback

Uncertain timeline as Apple refines ultra-thin strategy





Apple is reconsidering the future of its ultra-thin iPhone Air lineup, with plans to potentially release a redesigned second-generation model in spring 2027 featuring a dual-lens camera system, according to The Information. The move comes after the company indefinitely delayed the iPhone Air 2, which was originally scheduled to launch alongside the iPhone 18 Pro lineup in fall 2026.The redesign aims to address the primary complaint about the current iPhone Air: its single-lens rear camera. The Information reports that some Apple engineers are pushing to equip the next-generation model with a 48-megapixel Fusion Ultra Wide camera alongside the existing 48-megapixel Fusion Main camera, matching the dual-lens setup found on the standard iPhone 17.The first-generation iPhone Air, which launched in September 2025 at $999, has struggled to gain traction with consumers. The device's ultra-thin 5.6mm profile came at the cost of features buyers expect from premium smartphones, including a second camera, stereo speakers, and physical SIM support. With only a $100 price difference from the $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro—which offers a triple-lens camera system and significantly better battery life—many customers opted for the Pro model instead.Digital Chat Station, a Chinese tipster, first suggested the dual-camera possibility last week. The Information's report corroborates these claims, though implementing the change presents significant engineering challenges. Multiple technologies are currently housed in the iPhone Air's distinctive horizontal camera plateau to maximize battery space, meaning Apple would need to substantially redesign the device's internals to accommodate a second lens.If Apple proceeds with the spring 2027 launch, the iPhone Air 2 would release alongside the standard iPhone 18 and budget iPhone 18e, following Apple's reported new split launch cycle. The iPhone 18 Pro models and Apple's first foldable iPhone are expected to debut in fall 2026. However, given the extensive redesign required and the first-generation model's poor market performance, Apple's plans remain fluid and could change as development continues.",Apple is reportedly planning a second-generation iPhone Air with a dual-lens camera system.

How Google’s Private Compute keeps your information private

First features arriving on Pixel phones





Google wants your phone to think bigger while also keeping your data safe, and to achieve that, Google has built a cloud system that connects devices to heavy-duty Gemini models while keeping personal data sealed off—even from Google itself. It's called Private AI Compute, and much like how its name is similar to Apple's Private Cloud Compute, it also works similarlyIt's a solution to a problem that's been brewing: AI keeps getting smarter and hungrier for processing power, but people want their personal information to stay personal. Your phone can only do so much on its own, and Google says many AI tasks now need ""advanced reasoning and computational power"" beyond what fits in your pocket.Private AI Compute works through what Google calls a ""secure, fortified space"" running on its own chips—custom Tensor Processing Units paired with Titanium Intelligence Enclaves. Your device connects to this protected cloud environment through encrypted channels, creating a sealed pathway where your data flows but stays invisible to everyone else, including Google.The company brought in NCC Group to verify its privacy claims independently.The system encrypts everything in transit and uses AMD-based Trusted Execution Environments to wall off memory from the broader network, blocking outside access at the hardware level.Pixel devices are getting the first taste of this technology. Magic Cue on the Pixel 10 now delivers sharper, more contextual suggestions by pulling from those beefier cloud models. Meanwhile, the Recorder app on Pixel 8 and newer phones can now summarise transcriptions in seven languages: English, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Italian, French, German, and Japanese.Google says this is only the start. More products will get Private AI Compute capabilities down the line, and users who want to peek under the hood can track when it's running through developer settings.","Google has built a cloud system that connects devices to heavy-duty Gemini models while keeping personal data sealed off.

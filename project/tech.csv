Techies’ ‘ghar wapsi’ will be boon for offshoring: Experts after $100k fees imposed on H1-B visa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/techies-ghar-wapsi-will-be-boon-for-offshoring-experts-after-100k-fees-imposed-on-h1-b-visa/articleshow/124023031.cms,"File photo of applicants at US consulate in Mumbai waiting in line for their visa interview at a special camp organised earlier this year





American President Donald Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee is expected to trigger a sharper wave of offshoring by global IT firms while sparking a ‘ ghar wapsi ’ among Indian tech professionals to India. Indian IT leaders, however, appeared largely unfazed at the development. Most CEOs said their companies have built resilient operating models offshore and nearshore designed to withstand immigration-related disruptions. Many Indian IT firms have already reduced their reliance on H-1B visas to well below 50%, signalling the industry’s shift towards stronger offshore and near-shore delivery models.“Over the past several years, Indian IT firms have significantly reduced their reliance on the H-1B visa, with filings dropping by over 50%. This shift is a result of our ongoing strategy to hire more locally, invest in automation, and enhance our global delivery models. While visa fees may change, the impact on our business will be minimal, as we’ve already adapted to this evolving landscape,” CP Gurnani, founder & vice chairman, AionOS.What industry observers are arguing is how the new visa fee, if implemented, could reshape the IT talent landscape globally.Vivek Wadhwa, CEO of Vionix Biosciences and former distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School and Carnegie Mellon, warned of long-term consequences for the US.“Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee is economic suicide for America. It will force Indian talent to go home, taking with them skills, savings, and global experience. Indian engineers have been trapped in limbo for years because of endless visa backlogs. Trump has just pushed them to make the obvious choice: return home where opportunities are greater.” Wadhwa added that the reverse talent flow would benefit India enormously. “They will bring capital, networks, and the knowhow of scaling companies globally.”Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, said while the new policy’s practical longevity is questionable, there would be impacts to track. “This policy may not survive in court or Congress, but the damage is already done. It has jolted the industry into fast-tracking automation and near-shoring. Even if the $100,000 fee is overturned, providers and clients will lock in new strategies that reduce reliance on H-1Bs. In effect, the policy acts as a catalyst. It may not last, but it will accelerate structural change in how global IT services are delivered.”Among Indian companies, steps to reduce H-1B reliance have been afoot for some time. IT major TCS has built a formidable onshore presence in North America with over 46,000 employees across 32 locations, including key hubs in New York, Edison, Cincinnati, Santa Clara, Phoenix, and Austin. Infosys employs 34,388 professionals in the Americas, while HCLTech has more than 23,000 employees in the US, with 75% of its workforce locally hired.Asked whether Trump’s return as US president would accelerate near-shore strategies to ensure uninterrupted delivery for clients, TCS CEO Krithivasan had said in Jan, “On an annual basis, we get between 3,000 and 4,000 H-1B visas for a workforce of over 600,000. That’s a very small number. Even within the US, more than 50% of the workforce is locally hired. On an incremental hiring basis, we probably hire much more than 50% every year in the US compared to the H-1B workforce. So, our dependence on H-1B is quite limited. Near-shore exists because we sometimes want to provide sametime zone service to our customers. We are not particularly worried about any immigration reforms or changes in immigrant regulations.”Infosys CFO Jayesh Sanghrajka reinforced this shift in Jan, explaining how the company has steadily reduced its visa dependency. “We used to be at the 30% rate, but now we are at 24%. Within that, our nearshore has increased significantly. And within the US onsite population that we have, our H-1 independent folks are now over 60%. We have now built a pretty resilient model from that perspective. And we are, therefore, much more confident from where we are versus where we used to be earlier,” he said.On the other hand, venture capitalist Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, highlighted the implications on social media platform X: “Most BigTech companies have <15% of the workforce on H-1B... If you have to pay a $100k tax for 15k engineers that could be a $1.5B payout for a large company. This might push them to consider hiring less in the US and move offices offshore even faster than they already do. It creates a disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US. They have to pay a high education price and may now not be able to easily recoup it with a job. If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy. It makes the US’ global competitiveness a lot worse.”The Indian tech industry’s contributions to the US economy remain significant. According to a joint report by Nasscom and S&P Global, Indian IT firms employed 207,000 people in the US in 2021, with an average wage of $106,360. This represented a 22% increase over 2017. The report further noted that the Indian technology sector generated $103 billion in revenue from the US market in 2021. By supporting American enterprises, Indian IT firms indirectly generated a total of $396 billion in US sales output, supported 1.6 million jobs, and contributed more than $198 billion to the US economy.Against this backdrop, Trump’s new H-1B visa fee may act as a shortterm political lever, but its long-term effects could undermine US competitiveness while accelerating India’s role as a global hub for technology talent and innovation. It stands to bring back H-1B professionals armed with deep domain expertise, strong global networks, and the knowhow to scale firms to their next phase of growth. In effect, experts believe what Trump is really doing is driving innovation out of the US and handing India an economic gift that could define the next decade.","President Donald Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee is expected to trigger a sharper wave of offshoring by global IT firms.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

Tempt Cameo Review: Pocket-Sized Speaker To Boost Phone Audio





A cyberattack on US-based aviation technology provider Collins Aerospace has crippled some of Europe's busiest airports, forcing thousands of passengers to face lengthy delays and flight cancellations on Saturday (September 20). London's Heathrow Airport—Europe's busiest hub—along with Brussels Airport and Berlin Airport have been hit the maximum, affecting check-in and boarding systems across the continent. Dublin and Cork airports in Ireland later reported they were also experiencing minor impacts from the cyber incident.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the attack began Friday night, rendering automated check-in and baggage drop systems inoperable, forcing airports to rely on manual processes that significantly slowed operations.Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of defense contractor RTX, confirmed it was dealing with a ""cyber-related disruption"" to its software at multiple locations.“The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,” RTX said in a statement.Aviation data provider Cirium reported that 29 departures and arrivals had been canceled across the three main affected airports by afternoon.The disruption comes on what should have been a busy travel day, with 651 departures scheduled from Heathrow, 228 from Brussels, and 226 from Berlin.Brussels Airport warned passengers of significant delays, reporting an average one-hour delay for all departing flights and 10 cancellations. The airport's website advised travelers to confirm their flights with airlines before heading to the terminal.“This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations,” Brussels Airport stated.The cyber incident has left thousands of travelers in limbo, with many airlines unable to provide adequate support at affected airports. Passengers planning to travel through affected airports are advised to check with their airlines for the latest flight information and to allow extra time for manual check-in procedures until systems are fully restored.","A cyberattack on US-based aviation technology provider Collins Aerospace has crippled some of Europe's busiest airports.

H1-B visa price hike: What it means for Amazon, Microsoft, Google and others



iPhone 17 Pro Max: The Price Is Insane, But the Tech Is Better





Indian professionals, especially engineers and other tech workers, who want to work in the US are now facing a very different situation as President Donald Trump signed an order that puts a high annual fee of $100,000 on companies that want to sponsor H-1B visas. This change in policy is expected to have a big impact on Indian workers because they have always been the largest group to get H-1B visas. Citing government data from last year, news agency Reuters reported that 71% of all people who were approved for H-1B visas were from India, while China was a distant second with just 11.7%.This new policy could impact those who want to work in the US because tech companies will now have to pay a very high fee for non-American workers. As a result, companies may be less willing to sponsor H-1B visas, which could lead to fewer approvals.Moreover, those who are on leave and/or are visiting their families in their home countries are also under a looming threat as major technology companies scramble to protect their existing workforce following the announcement.Microsoft, JPMorgan, and Amazon sent urgent internal emails advising H-1B visa holders to remain in the United States or return immediately before the new fee structure takes effect at midnight Saturday (September 20).“H-1B visa holders who are currently in the US should remain in the US and avoid international travel until the government issues clear travel guidance,"" read an email sent to JPMorgan employees by Ogletree Deakins, the firm handling the bank's visa applications.The fee increase represents a huge shift from the previous cost structure. Companies previously paid just $995 total—$215 for lottery registration plus $780 for the employer petition form. The new $100,000 annual fee represents a more than 10,000% increase.For Indian professionals, this change creates a particularly challenging environment. While highly skilled workers with specialised expertise may still find opportunities, those seeking entry-level or junior positions face significantly reduced prospects as companies weigh the substantial financial commitment.The policy's impact will likely vary dramatically across different segments of Indian professionals. The most vulnerable may be recent graduates and early-career professionals in routine technical roles may find themselves priced out of the US job market. Startups and smaller companies, traditionally important entry points for Indian talent, may no longer afford the sponsorship costs.Senior engineers, research specialists, and professionals in niche fields with proven track records may still secure sponsorship from companies willing to invest in high-value talent.Notably, companies like Amazon, which leads H-1B approvals with over 12,000 visas in the first half of 2025, along with Microsoft and Meta (each with over 5,000 approvals), now face difficult decisions about their international hiring strategies.","President Donald Trump signed an order that puts a high annual fee of $100,000 on companies that want to sponsor H-1B visas.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk . The pay package has drawn fresh criticism, this time from Pope Leo XIV, who warned it reflects dangerous levels of inequality in society. In a media interview, published by Crux last week as part of a new biography by Senior Correspondent Elise Ann Allen, the Pope said such outsized compensation highlights the widening gap between workers and corporate executives.“Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean and what's that about?” Pope Leo said. “The Chicago-born linked Musk’s pay deal to growing polarization in both society and the Catholic Church. “CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving … 600 times more (now),” he said. He warned that if money alone defines value, “then we’re in big trouble.”Musk’s package has been at the center of debate in recent months. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders called it “grossly immoral” and “insane economics,” while Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended it as a reward for “doing things that no one else has done before.”Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas described it as a “good deal” for investors despite the massive number.Musk remains the world’s richest man, though he was briefly overtaken last week by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison after Oracle’s earnings beat expectations.The chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended Musk’s new multibillion-dollar compensation plan. The plan, which could be the largest in corporate history, was unveiled in a regulatory filing last week. In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals. "" She stated that Musk is capable of delivering world-changing technology if he is driven by these ambitious targets, even as the company faces a drop in sales and profits.“Putting together any compensation plan, you need to look at what motivates the individual that you’re trying to motivate. And for Elon, it’s doing things that no one else has done before,” Denholm said when asked about Musk’s proposed pay package.",Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk.

US and China reach “framework” deal to save TikTok from ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-and-china-reach-framework-deal-to-save-tiktok-from-ban/articleshow/123913556.cms,"Trump administration claims victory ahead of looming deadline

Questions remain over algorithm control and congressional approval





The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership, potentially averting a ban of the popular social media app just days before a September 17 deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the preliminary deal during trade talks in Madrid, saying President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will finalize the agreement in a Friday phone call.The framework would shift ownership of TikTok's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance to American investors, addressing national security concerns that have dominated the app's future for years. While Bessent declined to reveal commercial terms, calling it a deal ""between two private parties,"" he emphasized the agreement protects US security interests while preserving what Chinese negotiators consider the app's cultural characteristics.Trump celebrated the breakthrough on Truth Social, writing that ""a deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""The announcement comes after months of negotiations and three deadline extensions since Trump took office, with the current ban scheduled to take effect Wednesday if no agreement is reached.Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang confirmed the two sides reached a ""basic framework consensus"" on resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation. However, he warned the US against continued ""suppression"" of Chinese companies while seeking Chinese accommodation on American concerns.Critical details remain unresolved, including whether ByteDance will transfer control of TikTok's valuable recommendation algorithm that drives user engagement. Chinese officials previously expressed reluctance to export the algorithm technology, which Beijing considers strategically sensitive. Wang Jingtao from China's cyberspace regulator suggested the deal could involve licensing intellectual property rights rather than full transfer.Any final agreement may require approval from Congress, which passed bipartisan legislation in 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban due to national security fears. The law, upheld by the Supreme Court, prohibits companies from ""foreign adversary"" countries from owning more than 20 percent of the platform.Industry analysts expect Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally whose company currently hosts TikTok's US data, to lead the American investor group. TikTok serves approximately 170 million US users, making it one of the most significant social media platforms in the country.","The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership.

Edelweiss Mutual Fund CEO Radhika Gupta on Trump’s $100K H-1B Fee: ‘When one door closes …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/edelweiss-mutual-fund-ceo-radhika-gupta-on-on-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-when-one-door-closes-/articleshow/124013261.cms,"Read Radhika Gupta’s complete post here



I was fortunate to graduate in 2005, when H-1B norms were far more favorable in the US. But things changed quickly in 2008 during the financial crisis — many Indian students felt upset, lost, and stuck.

Some eventually returned home, and years later, even those of us who still had the visa made the same choice. Today, we’ve built fulfilling lives here — with tremendous professional opportunities and the deeper joy of creating in our own country. Personally, I wouldn’t want to go back — at all.

So, if you’re on a US campus right now feeling shaken or disheartened, I know what that feels like. But remember: when one door closes, many others open back home. And India of 2025 is a far more exciting place than India of 2005 ever was.

Chin up. Aao, ab laut chalen!

H-1B visa to now cost more



What it means for India







The Donald Trump administration announced a significant fees hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. The massive visa fess hike sent shockwaves across the technology and IT sector. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21.Now, Edelweiss Mutual Fund CEO and Shark Tank India judge Radhika Gupta has also shared her thoughts on the H-1B visa fees hike. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Gupta has urged the young professionals to see this disruption as a chance to return to home and build their futures in the country.In a now viral post, Gupta reflected on her own H-1B journey. She recalled how the 2008 financial crisis left many Indian graduates in the US “upset, lost, and stuck.” She revealed that many of them then returned to India, while others like her returned later despite still holding H-1B visa.“Today, we’ve built fulfilling lives here — with tremendous professional opportunities and the deeper joy of creating in our own country.Personally, I wouldn’t want to go back — at all,” Gupta wrote.Donald Trump has signed an executive order on Friday, September 19 introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, dealing a big blow to the technology sector that relies heavily on skilled workers from India and China. Anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes, Trump said “I think they're going to be very happy”.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem. With a booming digital economy, expanding capital markets, and global companies setting up R&D hubs, India of 2025 offers fertile ground for ambitious graduates who might once have seen the US as their only path to success.","Shark Tank India judge Radhika Gupta has shared her thoughts on the H-1B visa fees hike.

Inside SAP: Automating back office and coding

Productivity gains, fewer people

Catalyst or catastrophe





It is clear that AI is shaping the future and it is one of the reasons for layoffs as well. Now in a candid interview SAP CFO Dominik Asam has shared his brutal views on the adoption of AI. In an interview with Business Insider, Dominik Asam, chief financial officer of SAP said that AI is fundamentally reshaping how Europe’s most valuable software company operates by enabling it to produce more software with fewer people.Talking to Business Insider, Asam agreed that he himself is a ‘massive user’ of AI tools in his own work. Asam mentioned that he often use AI tools to prepare presentations he also uses Perplexity to pull data on market trends. One query revealed that 28% of the MSCI World Index is now made up of IT companies, far ahead of banking and financial services. Another showed that nine of the world’s 10 largest companies by market cap are tech firms, underscoring his oft-repeated mantra that “software is eating the world. ”Asam also revealed that within SAP AI is being deployed across back-office operations and software engineering. He mentioned that thousands of employees in the administrative unit are seeing automated tasks, where was more than 30,000 plus developers are using AI tools for coding and for accelerating their output.Along with this, Asam also works against the investor concerns that AI will enable customers to bypass SAP and create their own software. “Will it be a not-so-proficient software department of an industrial conglomerate leveraging AI tools? Or will it be SAP doing a super systematic transformation program and bringing 30,000 plus developers onto these new AI coding tools?” he asked.Speaking to BI, Asam also revealed what AI means for SAP. Asam said that SAP can deliver more with same number of engineers. “There’s more automation, simply. There are certain tasks which are automated and for the same volume of output we can afford to have less people,” he said. Asam also mentioned that this approach is part of SAP’s five-year plan and it is designed to boost productivity and lift profit margins.Asam also feels that AI is both an opportunity and risk. “I will be brutal. And I also say this internally. For SAP and any other software company, AI is a great catalyst. It can be either great or catastrophe. It will be great if you do it well, if you are able to implement it and do it faster than others. If you are left behind, you will have a problem for sure. We work day and night to not fall behind.”","Dominik Asam, chief financial officer of SAP said that AI is fundamentally reshaping how Europe’s most valuable software company operates.

A hilarious and now viral moment happed outside an Apple Store when a fan accidentally dropped its newly purchased iPhone 17 Pro. After waiting for more than 15 hours in a line, an Apple fan who purchase the all new iPhone 17 Pro accidentally dropped it right in front of the Apple CEO Tim Cook.The viral incident captured on video is now being shared on multiple social media platforms including X (formerly known as Twitter) and TikTok. The video shows a fan and content creator Primz unboxing the popular Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro in front of the Apple CEO. Within seconds of opening the box, the device slipped from hands and hit the ground.Cook, visibly surprised, bent down alongside the fan to pick up the phone. According to those present, the Apple chief chuckled and reassured him: ‘It will be ok’.Despite the mishap, the fan quickly recovered from the awkward moment. He handed the phone to Cook, who signed a piece of paper placed over the device’s screen. The video has since gone viral, one user on X wrote: “Imagine not getting your iPhone signed by Tim after you drop it.That would’ve been worth $$$.” Another commented: “Second-hand embarrassment is real. Bro did a drop test in front of the CEO.”Apple CEO Tim Cook recently shared the first photos clicked using the all-new iPhone 17 Pro Max. Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Cook unveiled three different photos captured on 2025’s most expensive iPhone by photographers Inez & Vinoodh, Mickalene Thomas and Trunk Xu. The first photo shows two people holding hands as they run down a city sidewalk, a strip of red fabric flowing behind them. The sun sets in the background, with a gas station and beige-and-white buildings in view.The second photo, shot in black and white, captures three dancers in fitted bodysuits striking a synchronized pose on a concrete surface. They face away from the camera, with dense trees and a clear sky forming the backdrop.The third photo shows four skateboarders at a skatepark. Two ride down a ramp in the foreground, while one sits on the edge watching. Another walks across the top of the ramp, board in hand.","Apple CEO Tim Cook recently shared the first photos clicked using the all-new iPhone 17 Pro Max.

Donald Trump signs order to increase H-1B visa application fee to $100,000

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Indians likely to be hit most with H-1B visa fee hike







JPMorgan has asked H1-B visa holders currently outside the United States to return before 12:01am ET on September 21, following a new directive from President Donald Trump that requires companies to pay an annual fee of $100,000 for each H-1B worker. As per a report by news agency Reuters, JPMorgan Chase’s external immigration counsel has sent an email to its employees, issuing a precautionary advisory to H-1B visa holders, urging them to return to the US immediately. The email further advises H-1B employees residing in the US to avoid international travel until further guidance.The move comes as companies and employees prepare for the administration’s latest immigration order. Earlier this week, Microsoft issued a similar instruction, urging its H-1B and H-4 visa employees to return to the U.S. and remain there for the foreseeable future.Donald Trump signed an order introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications. Explaining the move, Trump said “The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”.Anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes, Trump said “I think they're going to be very happy”.According to the US government data, India accounted for 71% of approved beneficiaries, with China coming second at 11.7%. In the first half of 2025, Amazon and its cloud unit AWS secured approvals for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Microsoft and Meta each obtained over 5,000 approvals.The deadline for the new H1-B visa fee hike is September 21. Once the new rules come into effect, Indians are likely to be hit the hardest. Indian IT firms including Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have traditionally depended on H-1B visas to deploy engineers and developers on U.S. projects. With visas generally valid for three years and extendable up to six, industry executives caution that the newly mandated fee could render the placement of Indian professionals in the US financially unviable.","JPMorgan has asked H1-B visa holders to return to the U.S. before September 21.

Elon Musk-owned xAI has released a new artificial intelligence model named Grok 4 Fast, positioned as a cost-efficient version of its Grok 4 system. The company said the model is designed for both enterprise and consumer applications, combining reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities within a single framework.According to xAI, Grok 4 Fast uses 40% fewer “thinking tokens” on average compared to Grok 4, while maintaining comparable accuracy across benchmarks. Independent review by Artificial Analysis confirmed a lower cost-to-performance ratio, showing Grok 4 Fast requires up to 98% less spending to achieve results similar to Grok 4.Benchmark results provided by xAI showed Grok 4 Fast performing at 85.7% on the GPQA Diamond test, 92% on AIME 2025, and 93.3% on HMMT 2025, closely matching Grok 4’s performance. The model also demonstrated improvements in code execution and search-based benchmarks, including a 95% pass rate on SimpleQA and 74% on X Bench Deepsearch.The model features a 2 million token context window, enabling it to handle large inputs, and was trained using reinforcement learning to optimize its efficiency. Unlike earlier versions that required separate reasoning and non-reasoning models, Grok 4 Fast integrates both into one system, reducing latency and cost.xAI stated that Grok 4 Fast is now available to all users on grok.com, as well as on iOS and Android apps. It is also being deployed on platforms such as OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, and through the xAI API. For a limited time, the model will be offered free on OpenRouter and Vercel.Two versions of the model are available — grok-4-fast-reasoning and grok-4-fast-non-reasoning — both supporting the 2M token limit.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Poll Do you think the new $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas will impact the tech industry negatively? Yes, it will hurt the industry. No, it won't have a significant impact.



India accounts for most H-1B visas







Microsoft has urged its employees on H-1B and H-4 visas to return to the US immediately before the Trump administration’s September 21 deadline, after which companies will be required to pay $100,000 per year for each H-1B worker visa. According to an internal email reviewed by Reuters, the software giant has also advised those already in the US to stay there for the foreseeable future.“H-1B visa holders should stay in the US for the foreseeable future. Also recommend H-4 visa holders remain in the US. Strongly recommend H-1B and H-4 visa holders return to the US tomorrow before the deadline,” Microsoft said in its email to employees as quoted by Reuters.Donald Trump has signed an executive order on Friday, September 19 introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, dealing a big blow to the technology sector that relies heavily on skilled workers from India and China. Anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes, Trump said “I think they're going to be very happy”.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said “If you're going to train somebody, you're going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land.Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs”.White House staff secretary Will Scharf said, ""One of the most abused visa systems is the H1-B non-immigrant visa programme. This is supposed to allow highly skilled labourers who work in fields that Americans don't work in to come into the United States of America. What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. ""India remained the leading recipient of H-1B visas last year. As per the government data, the country alone accounted for 71% of approved beneficiaries, with China trailing at 11.7%.In the first half of 2025, Amazon and its cloud unit AWS secured approvals for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Microsoft and Meta each obtained over 5,000 approvals.","Microsoft has urged its employees on H-1B and H-4 visas to return to the US immediately before the Trump administration’s September 21 deadline.

Microsoft announces second Xbox price hike this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-announces-second-xbox-price-hike-this-year/articleshow/124009791.cms,"



Microsoft will increase Xbox Series console prices in the United States starting October 3, marking the second price hike this year as the company blames ""changes in the macroeconomic environment"" — widely interpreted as impacts from tariffs on imported goods.The Xbox Series X will jump $50 to $649.99, while the entry-level Xbox Series S increases $20 to $399.99. The premium 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition faces the steepest increase at $70, bringing its price to $799.99. Digital versions of the consoles will also see price bumps ranging from $20 to $50.These latest increases compound May's price hikes, resulting in dramatic cumulative increases over six months. The standard Xbox Series X has risen $150 from its original $499.99 launch price, while the Galaxy Black Special Edition has jumped $200 in just one year since its debut.The timing follows similar moves by competitors Sony and Nintendo, who raised PlayStation 5 and Switch console prices respectively in recent months. Industry analysts point to President Trump's tariffs on goods manufactured in China, Vietnam, and India as the primary driver behind these widespread price increases across gaming hardware.Microsoft's price adjustments now position some Xbox models unfavorably against competitors.The $599.99 Xbox Series X Digital costs $50 more than Sony's PS5 Digital Edition, while the $799.99 Galaxy Special Edition exceeds the price of Sony's new PS5 Pro at $749.99, despite offering less performance.The company emphasized that controller and headset pricing will remain unchanged, and international markets won't see price adjustments. However, Xbox pricing outside the US had already increased in previous rounds of global price hikes.Consumers looking to avoid the increases have until October 3 to purchase consoles at current prices from retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. With ongoing economic uncertainties and potential for additional tariff impacts, industry experts suggest this may not be the final price adjustment for gaming hardware this year.","Microsoft will increase Xbox Series console prices in the United States starting October 3.

Bill Gates on AI-helping cut global child mortality by half: ‘The story’s not over yet’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-on-ai-helping-cut-global-child-mortality-by-half-the-storys-not-over-yet/articleshow/124006392.cms,"""stunning achievement""

""the story's not over yet,""

Read what Bill Gates wrote about global child mortality being reduced by half



“One of humanity’s most stunning achievements is something most people don’t even realise happened.

In 2000, more than 10 million children died before they reached their fifth birthday. Today, it’s less than 5 million. The world cut child mortality in half in just 25 years.

It’s an amazing success story. But the story’s not over yet. In fact, right now, the next chapter is being written as governments around the world set their budgets. And global leaders have a once-in-a-generation chance to do something extraordinary.

Countries around the world have the expertise to solve major health problems—but they need the tools, medicines, and vaccines to make it happen. That’s what global health institutions like the

Global Fund

and Gavi were designed to do: help countries make smarter and more cost-effective decisions.

I believe that opportunity shouldn’t be an accident of birth, and where you live shouldn’t determine if you live. I’ve announced that I’m giving away virtually all my wealth to support this effort over the next 20 years, because this is a critical moment for progress. But the fact remains: we won’t get there without rich countries giving a small fraction of their budgets to help the world’s poorest people and save millions of lives.

That’s where government decisions come in. Of course, budget deliberations are difficult. Many of the countries that have given the most health aid in the past face high debt levels, aging populations, and domestic challenges.

I’m not naive. I don’t expect most governments to suddenly restore foreign aid to historic levels.

But I am an optimist.

Because while things may seem dire right now, two things can be true at once: what’s happening to the health of the world’s children is worse than most people realise, and our long-term prospects are better than most people can imagine.

That’s the paradox of this moment: funding for global health is shrinking. But science is accelerating—and people are determined to make sure innovations reach children who need them, no matter where they happen to be born.

The choices we make today will determine what the world looks like for the next generation. I’m a grandfather now, so this hits even closer to home. I want my grandkids to grow up in a world where kids know what diseases like HIV, polio, and sickle cell anaemia were, but don’t know anyone who has them.

A world where malaria wards are empty—because no child is at risk of the disease.

A world where everyone survives childbirth—and childhood.

That’s the future every child deserves. And we can all play a part in building it.

I’m talking to leaders about how to do more with less. That includes focusing on core lifesaving programs, doubling down on innovations that can eradicate and cure diseases, not just manage them, and laying a pathway out of our outdated, donor-recipient model of global aid toward a sustainable model where countries are self-sufficient.

But none of that can happen if donor countries don’t invest in the health of all people, especially children. Take the Global Fund. It’s probably the most effective lifesaving initiative of the 21st century: since 2002, it’s saved 70 million lives from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.

At the Global Fund replenishment in November, we’ll see just how high of a priority this is for countries. Our foundation will announce our contribution next week, and I’ll be interested to see what governments bring to the table.

Low-income countries can also do more to prioritise the health of their citizens. Many poorer countries spend less than 3% of their domestic budgets on health. In many cases, it is not because they don’t want to spend more—it’s because they face crippling debt burdens and interest repayments. Global financial institutions must relieve the burden of debt so that low-income countries can free up resources to invest more in the health of their people.

Yes, humanity is at a crossroads. But I’m betting on humanity because no challenge is greater than the power of people working together to solve it.

Every day, I’m inspired by people I meet, like Dr

Opeyemi Akinajo

, who is working on AI-aided sensors that can help more moms and babies survive childbirth. Or Indonesia’s health minister,

Budi Sadikin

, who’s working tirelessly to ensure children have access to the health care they need to get the best possible start at life.

I’m inspired by stories closer to home, too—like

Maddie

and

Emile Leeflang

, teenagers from Utah who were moved by their volunteer work in Kenya to advocate for health aid.

In every corner of the world, there are good people dedicated to making a difference.

Will we be there for them? Will countries ensure their budgets support the health of the world’s children? Will we ensure new breakthroughs reach the people who need them most?

The answers are entirely within our control.”

iPhone 17 Pro Max: The Price Is Insane, But the Tech Is Better





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that a combination of global investment and technological breakthroughs, including AI, has the potential to save millions of children's lives. In a blog post, Gates highlighted that global child mortality has already been cut in half over the past 25 years, a, he says most people don't realise happened. However, Gates warns thatas funding for global health is currently shrinking despite the acceleration of new scientific innovations. He has also urged governments to invest in global health to ensure that discoveries, like AI-aided sensors that help mothers and babies survive childbirth to reach the people who need them most.In a statement shared on The Time magazine, Gates wrote:","In 2000, more than 10 million children died before they reached their fifth birthday.

Samsung may bring first tri-fold phone to US this year: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-may-bring-first-tri-fold-phone-to-us-this-year-report/articleshow/124002405.cms,"Representative image

“A much larger screen than before”

Betting on foldables





Samsung is considering releasing its upcoming “tri-fold” smartphone in the United States later this year, marking the first time such a device would be available in the market, according to a CNN Business report. Samsung is still weighing which markets to launch the device in, but the US is part of those discussions, a person familiar with the company’s plans told the publication. Notably, Samsung has often limited new product lines to certain regions, such as South Korea and China. For instance, last year it released the Galaxy Z Fold 6 SE only in those countries.Chinese rival Huawei already sells a tri-folding phone, but the company does not operate in the US market. If Samsung proceeds, it would make the device the first tri-fold smartphone available to American consumers.The tri-fold is expected to fold in two places, offering a display larger than Samsung’s current foldables. “I think what we’re seeing is a bit more of a return to life before (the smartphone),” said Drew Blackard, senior vice president of mobile product management for Samsung Electronics America, in an interview with CNN.“When older cell phones had different forms and people wanted a variety of options.”Minseok Kang, Samsung’s global head of smartphone product planning, told the publication that the 2025 launch timeline is on track. Kang described the new form factor as the next step in a product strategy that has already seen strong demand for the Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold, which together saw a 25% increase in preorders compared to their predecessors. The Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung’s latest foldable, unfolds to an eight-inch screen.Samsung has teased tri-folding prototypes at trade shows, including the Flex G and Flex S concepts. The upcoming phone would mark the first time those designs are translated into a commercial product.“I think… the exciting part is getting it out into the wild and then ultimately seeing what different users are attracted to,” Blackard told CNN.Analysts say the tri-fold could remain a niche, high-priced device like Samsung’s existing Fold lineup. But it could help the company stand apart from rivals, especially as Apple prepares to launch its iPhone Air this week and reportedly develops its own foldable phone for 2026.","The tri-fold is expected to fold in two places, offering a display larger than Samsung’s current foldables.

Leaner team, sharper focus







In a strategic move Softbank group will reportedly layoff 20% of its Vision Fund workforce. As reported by Reuters, the internal memo the will is firing 20% of its workforce form the Vision Fund division. This move of the company marks the return to founder Masayoshi Son’s signature high-risk, high-reward investment style—this time focused squarely on artificial intelligence. As per Reuters, the fresh round of layoffs will impact 60 employees of the global team. Unlike previous reductions triggered by mounting losses, this round follows the fund’s strongest quarterly performance since June 2021, buoyed by gains in public holdings such as Nvidia and Coupang. “We continually adjust the organization to best execute our long-term strategy—making bold, high-conviction investments in AI and breakthrough technologies,” a Vision Fund spokesperson told Reuters.This restructuring at Softbank signals a decisive shift away from Vision Fund’s sprawling startup portfolio toward capital-intensive AI infrastructure. As per the report, Softbank founder Son is now moving the resources into a handful of massive bets such as $30 billion investment in OpenAI, $6,5 billion acquisition of chip designer Ampere Computing and $500 billion in Stargate project which is a joint venture of OpenAI and Oracle.The report also suggests the Son is also pursuing $1 trillion AI industrial park in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.As per Reuters report, the fresh round of layoffs indicate that with fewer teams and narrower focus, the Vision Fund will need less number of investment advisers. At its peak in 2020, the fund employed 474 people; today, that number has shrunk by nearly 40%.The layoffs also reflect on Son’s belief that the next wave of tech will be driven by AI models, semiconductors, and data infrastructure—not broad venture capital plays. SoftBank has already taken stakes in Intel, Nvidia, and acquired chip firms Graphcore and Ampere Computing, aiming to build a full-stack AI ecosystem.","Softbank group will reportedly layoff 20% of its Vision Fund workforce.

“Time is too precious”: Warren Buffett explains why he won’t upgrade his 11-year-old car,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/time-is-too-precious-warren-buffett-explains-why-he-wont-upgrade-his-11-year-old-car/articleshow/124000708.cms,"Time over money



A lesson in simplicity







Most of the billionaires often flaunt their luxury lifestyle by showing off their expensive cars as a status symbol, however, Warren Buffett does not believe in this show off. The billionaire loves his 11-year old car and treats it like a kitchen appliance. At 94, the legendary investor drives a 2014 Cadillac XTS—complete with hail damage—because, in his words, “a half a day I don’t want to give up” is too steep a price for car shopping. Buffett’s approach towards not buying a car is not new. At the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in 2001, Buffett explained that simplicity and safety matters the most to him and not style. His present Cadillac, which was purchased by his daughter Susie Buffett, reflects that ethos. Susie purchased the car from Huber Cadillac in Omaha, posing as a regular customer. Later Buffett praised the dealership in a letter to GM CEO Mary Barra for treating her fairly—without knowing she was buying for one of the world’s richest men.Buffett views of still using the 11-year old car is rooted in his philosophy that time is the most valuable asset. “If I could write a check in 30 seconds and be in the same position I’m in now with a newer car, I’d be glad to do it this afternoon,” he once said.“But I don’t like to trade away when there’s really no benefit to me at all.”Every year he drives around 3,500 miles a year and despite some occasional nudges from his daughter to upgrade, he remains content. To Buffett, cars are about utility, safety, and efficiency—not prestige.As reported by Cox Automotive’s 2023 Car Buyer Journey Study, most of the Americans spend around 12 to 14 hours in buying a car. Buffett’s decision of delegating the task to her daughter underscores the belief that those hours can be spent in reading, investing and thinking.His investing philosophy mirrors his driving habits: buy quality, hold long, and avoid unnecessary churn. “I’m totally happy with the car,” he said in 2001—and he’s still proving it today, behind the wheel of a Cadillac that’s weathered more than just Nebraska hailstorms.","Warren Buffett drives an 11-year-old Cadillac XTS.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to finalise a deal that would allow the popular short-video app TikTok to continue operating in the United States. The call may also pave the way for a future in-person meeting between the two leaders, according to reports.Speaking to Fox News, Trump said the two sides were “very close to deals on all of it.” He expressed confidence in his relationship with China and confirmed, “it sounds like they’ve approved TikTok.”Trump also highlighted the app's value and its role in his election campaign.“I like TikTok. It helped get me elected,” Trump said. “In fact, Charlie [Kirk] said, 'Sir, you want to get on TikTok. You’d be great.' I said, 'Really, tell me about TikTok.'

These two reasons prove Apple and iPhones are still 'Big' in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/these-two-reasons-prove-apple-and-iphones-are-still-big-in-china/articleshow/123998491.cms,"iPhone 17 series breaks iPhone 16 series' China records

iPhone 17 Pro Max: The Price Is Insane, But the Tech Is Better





iPhone 17 series is now available worldwide, including in China – a country where it has witnessed some turbulent times when it comes to sales. However, reports suggest that the launch of the iPhone 17 series in Apple’s one of the biggest markets appears to be off to a promising start, with hundreds of people lining up at Apple’s flagship store in Beijing on Friday to pick up their new phones.According to a report by news agency Reuters, approximately 300 customers arrived at the store in the Sanlitun area, signaling strong initial demand in the world's second-largest economy. Among the customers was 35-year-old Shuke Wang, who purchased the iPhone 17 Pro Max, a model analysts believe will be the best-selling device in the new series.Wang noted that while he liked the redesign and the look of the new ultra-thin iPhone Air, he ultimately chose the Pro Max for its longer battery life.Not only long queues but also the fact that iPhone 17 series broke pre-order records in China, surpassing the previous year's iPhone 16 launch also suggest that Apple’s craze is still high in China. According to the South China Morning Post, pre-orders on the e-commerce platform JD.com exceeded the entire first-day volume of the iPhone 16 within just one minute of going live.The overwhelming demand led to technical issues, with customers reporting website crashes and payment delays of up to five minutes on Apple's official site.For the iPhone 17 Pro Max, all in-person pickup slots at Shanghai's Apple Stores were fully booked within 20 minutes, and delivery delays for customers in Guangzhou now extend into October. The standard iPhone 17 with 256GB storage proved to be the most popular model.This record-breaking performance highlights Apple's strong brand loyalty in China. According to analysts, the iPhone 17 series could provide a crucial boost to Apple's market share in China, which has faced pressure from increasing competition with companies like Huawei and Xiaomi.Omdia senior analyst Chiew Le Xuan stated that he expects iPhone shipments in China to rise by 11% year-over-year in the second half of the year, driven by the new series. He added that the iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to become Apple’s top-performing model in the Chinese market in 2026.Despite the strong launch, Apple still faces challenges in the Chinese market. The company does not disclose pre-order figures, and data from Counterpoint Research shows a 6% decrease in Apple's shipments in the first eight weeks of the third quarter.","iPhone 17 series broke pre-order records in China, surpassing the previous year's iPhone 16 launch.

Dating app users may soon bid farewell to mindlessly scrolling through hundreds of profiles, according to Hinge CEO Justin McLeod, who believes artificial intelligence will change online matchmaking within the next few years.In an interview with Fast Company, McLeod predicted that AI-powered personalised matching will make mass swiping ""relatively arcane"" in three to five years, possibly sooner. The technology would allow users to articulate their preferences and values in natural language rather than the current ""Morse code of likes and passes.""""Three to five years from now, it will feel relatively arcane to feel like you had to go through hundreds of profiles, if not more, in order to get out on a date,"" McLeod told the publication.The Hinge founder envisions a future where daters can explain ""who they are, what their values are, and what matters to them"" in their own words, enabling more sophisticated matching algorithms. Currently, dating apps struggle to understand why users like or reject potential matches, limiting their ability to improve recommendations.However, McLeod draws a firm line against AI companions, rejecting Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's suggestion that chatbots could address America's ""loneliness epidemic.""McLeod called this an ""extraordinarily reductive view"" of friendship, emphasizing that AI should enhance human connections, not replace them.Hinge's success supports McLeod's optimistic outlook for online dating's future.

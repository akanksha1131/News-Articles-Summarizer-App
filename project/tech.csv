"After 'Kiss-Cam video', ex-Astronomer CEO Andy Byron caught in OnlyFans scandal reportedly shared by his wife",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-kiss-cam-video-ex-astronomer-ceo-andy-byron-caught-in-onlyfans-scandal-reportedly-shared-by-his-wife/articleshow/123173101.cms,"What Sophie Rain said on chatting with Andy Byron

Andy Byron, the former CEO of data analytics firm Astronomer, is embroiled in a viral controversy after his wife, Megan Kerrigan, allegedly leaked private messages revealing his interactions with OnlyFans creator Sophie Rain. What started as a lighthearted Kiss-Cam moment at a Coldplay concert has escalated into a social media firestorm, captivating online audiences and raising questions about infidelity and privacy.According to screenshots purportedly shared by Andy Byron's wife Kerrigan, Byron used a secretive messaging app, Finsta, to pay up to $40,000 for explicit video calls with Rain, a prominent content creator and member of the influencer collective Bop House. In one alleged exchange, Byron wrote, “All good. Most guys I talk to are married,” to which Rain reportedly responded, “Okay, call me in 5 mins [winky face].” The leaked messages have sparked widespread debate online, with Kerrigan’s decision to expose her husband’s alleged actions drawing both support and criticism. Byron, who stepped down from his role at Astronomer amid the scandal, has not publicly commented on the allegations. Astronomer too has not made any comment on the new controversy about its ex-CEO.Sophie Rain, addressing the controversy in an exclusive statement to The Blast, declined to confirm or deny details about her clients but expressed sympathy for Kerrigan. “I can’t comment on who my clients and donors are, but this situation is crazy,” Rain said. “As a Christian, I don’t condone this type of behavior. I’m here for his wife if she needs a friend during this time. If she has any issues, she can reach out to me. I’d love to talk and reassure her that this guy is just a bump in the road.”Rain also referenced the Coldplay concert that inadvertently sparked the drama, adding, “I’m a huge fan of Coldplay. I’m glad this happened. Cheaters are the worst people on this planet. I applaud Chris Martin for integrating this into his show.”Bop House creator Camilla Araujo claimed that Byron spent “over $250,000” on subscriptions, custom content, and video calls with multiple OnlyFans creators, many of whom, she says, were affiliated with her influencer mansion. In an exclusive statement to The Blast, Bop House creator Camilla Araujo claims Byron didn’t just spend thousands on OnlyFans star Sophie Rain, he allegedly dropped “over $250,000” on content from multiple creators, including others affiliated with her influencer mansion, the Bop House.Andy Byron's wife, Megan Kerrigan, is yet to issue a formal statement, but sources reportedly told The Daily Mail that she's been keeping a low profile at the couple's luxury estate in Kennebunk, Maine","Andy Byron, the former CEO of data analytics firm Astronomer, is embroiled in a viral controversy after his wife, Megan Kerrigan, allegedly leaked private messages revealing his interactions with OnlyFans creator Sophie Rain.

Realme Buds T200 Review: Vibrant Sound, Sleek Design

In a move that can be seen as a step to monetise X’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, Elon Musk has announced plans to introduce advertising into the answers generated by the platform’s AI chatbot, Grok. This strategy marks a new direction for the company’s advertising business, which Musk is now directly overseeing following the departure of former CEO Linda Yaccarino , a report has said.According to Financial Times, during a live broadcast discussion with advertisers, Musk stated that marketers would soon be able to pay for their products or services to appear within Grok’s responses.“If a user’s trying to solve a problem [by asking Grok], then advertising the specific solution would be ideal at that point,” he explained. Musk indicated that this shift is necessary to help pay for the costly graphics processing units (GPUs) required to power AI applications.Musk also outlined broader plans to leverage xAI’s technology to transform X’s advertising infrastructure. The goal is to automate the advertising process for brands and significantly improve ad targeting. This effort comes after X’s ad tech team reportedly faced challenges in effectively reaching its intended audience.The announcement comes as X continues to face heat from some advertisers over content moderation issues. Recently, Grok drew controversy for generating pro-Hitler and antisemitic content, raising concerns about the AI's safety guardrails.In an email sent to some advertisers, X highlighted recent improvements to its ad auctions, claiming a 40% rise in conversions for web ads and a 7% decrease in average advertising costs quarter-on-quarter.Moreover, Musk’s direct engagement with advertisers reestablishes him as the public face of X’s business operations. His re-emergence follows the departure of Linda Yaccarino in July, who had often served as an intermediary between marketers and Musk.","Elon Musk has announced plans to introduce advertising into the answers generated by the platform's AI chatbot, Grok.

Realme Buds T200 Review: Vibrant Sound, Sleek Design

Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently shared an advice for young job seekers, particularly Generation Z (Gen Z). In an interview with CNN, Gates said that while using AI is “fun and empowering”, he cautioned that mere knowledge of the AI tools will not be enough to ensure long-term employment stability. He warned that technical skills are important, they won’t safeguard workers from being laid off. “This proficiency, despite the widespread emphasis on digital literacy, is not a safeguard against a pink slip,” Bill Gates said.Despite this, Gates maintained that his advice to the younger generation remains the same: “Be curious, read and use the latest tools.”During the interview, Bill Gates acknowledged that artificial intelligence is already capable of handling simple coding tasks, but said that more advanced work is still out of reach. He also warned that even blue-collar jobs may soon be impacted.“When robotic arms start to be decent, which they're not today, it will start to affect even larger classes of labour,” Gates said.Despite concerns about job losses, Gates said he believes that higher productivity through automation could result in greater benefits for workers.“If you get more productive, that's good. It means you can free up these people... to have longer vacations or, you know, to help do more. So it's not a bad thing,” Bill Gates said.In the same interview, Gates said that AI can currently replace humans in simpler tasks, but it is not capable enough to handle the most complex coding tasks yet. Gates noted that experts in the field disagree on whether AI will achieve this capability within the next one to two years or if it is still a decade away. However, he highlighted that AI is ""improving at a rate that surprises"" him.","Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently shared an advice for young job seekers, particularly Generation Z (Gen Z) In an interview with CNN, Gates said that while using AI is ‘fun and empowering’, he cautioned that mere knowledge of the AI tools will not be enough to ensure long-term employment stability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123168761,imgsize-16588,width-400,resizemode-4/Bill-Gates.jpg"

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Tim Cook: Four new Apple stores coming to major Indian cities



Apple retail growth accelerates globally with strong focus on India and the Middle East

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Microsoft is reportedly making a ""promise"" of a more lively, startup-like work environment to the employees it is poaching from Google DeepMind . A report citing people who have received the offers claimed that Microsoft’s recent offers have been ""heftier"" than those at DeepMind, still they don’t match the scale of nine-figure contracts offered by Meta. To compare, Facebook-parent Meta has reportedly provided some researchers with contracts worth $300 million. These recent offers from Microsoft didn't exceed what the social media giant offereed but they were higher than the typical pay at DeepMind, particularly for long-time employees.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Suleyman, who is also a co-founder of Google’s DeepMind, is reportedly recruiting these talents personally and has been pitching recruits on the idea that the new AI division at Microsoft is a more flexible workplace than what DeepMind has become under Google's ownership. Suleyman has promised recruits more freedom and smaller teams, a “startup vibe” that has reportedly appealed to several targets.Microsoft has already hired at least two dozen executives and other employees from Google in recent months, most of whom came from Google DeepMind. This includes prominent figures like Adam Sadovsky, a former distinguished engineer, and Amar Subramanya, a former VP of engineering at Google. Microsoft’s latest strategy seems to be an effort to close the gap in the AI race.one of the recruits from Deepmind, Subramanya, wrote in a post shared on social networking site LinkedIn last month while announcing his new role at Microsoft.As per the report, Suleyman has been given autonomy by CEO Satya Nadella to lead Microsoft’s AI efforts and attract top talent with competitive offers. His team operates mainly from Mountain View, California, with a presence in London, and functions independently from Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.The report also noted that a Microsoft spokesman has claimed that all of its senior leadersThe new Google hires will focus on consumer-facing products like Microsoft's Copilot chatbot, which competes with ChatGPT and Gemini, the report adds. Led by Suleyman, the consumer version of Copilot is separate from the enterprise versions used in Microsoft 365 and GitHub.Recently, Microsoft even announced deeper Copilot integration with the Edge browser to assist with tasks like comparing hotel options using open tabs.On the other hand, DeepMind expanded to around 6,000 employees as it became a key part of Google’s AI efforts. Some recruits said that they prefer working at Microsoft compared to their previous company due to its less bureaucratic structure.Former Google executive Laszlo Bock noted that Google now resembles a 20-year-earlier version of Microsoft, profitable but often slow-moving, hierarchical and political.he said.To counter this, Google has reportedly said that its attrition rates are below the industry average and noted that it has also hired several employees from Microsoft.a Google spokesperson said to WSJ..","Microsoft is reportedly making a ""promise"" of a more lively, startup-like work environment to the employees it is poaching from Google DeepMind.

Realme Buds T200 Review: Vibrant Sound, Sleek Design

President Donald Trump has publicly called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign immediately, alleging a significant “conflict of interest.” The demand, posted on Trump's Truth Social platform on Thursday (August 7), comes days after US Senator Tom Cotton has sent a letter to the US chipmaker’s board chair, seeking clarifications about the new CEO and his alleged ties to Chinese firms.“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Following this statement, Intel's shares dropped by 5% in premarket trading.It is to be noted that Lip-Bu Tan was appointed CEO of the chipmaking giant in March, taking the helm as the company struggled to recover from a period of declining sales under his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger.Trump's call for resignation comes just days after Senator Cotton raised concerns about Tan's alleged ties to Chinese companies. Senator Cotton also referenced a recent criminal case involving Cadence Design, a company where Tan served as CEO until 2021.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Senator Cotton expressed “concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on US national security.”In his letter, Cotton specifically asked whether Intel's board was aware of subpoenas sent to Cadence Design during Tan's tenure as CEO, which concluded in 2021. He also sought details on what measures were taken to address those concerns before Tan's hiring at Intel.Cotton further questioned if Intel's board required Tan to divest from Chinese chip firms linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party. He also inquired whether Tan adequately disclosed any other ties to Chinese companies, especially given Intel's critical role in the Secure Enclave program.","President Donald Trump has publicly called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign immediately.

How ShinyHunters hacked Google’s Salesforce database

Realme Buds T200 Review: Vibrant Sound, Sleek Design

Google has confirmed that a cyber criminal group broke into its Salesforce database. The tech giant said that hacking group popularly known as ShinyHunters , formally designated as UNC6040 is behind the breach. The company’s Threat Intelligence Group published a blog post saying “In June, one of Google’s corporate Salesforce instances was impacted by similar UNC6040 activity”. However, it did not reveal the number of customers affected by the hack.“Analysis revealed that data was retrieved by the threat actor during a small window of time before the access was cut off. The data retrieved by the threat actor was confined to basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details,” the company said.The blog post said that Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has observed an evolution in UNC6040's TTPs. While the group initially relied on the Salesforce Dataloader application, they have since shifted to using custom applications. These custom applications are typically Python scripts that perform a similar function to the Dataloader app.As explained in the post, the updated attack chain involves a voice call to enroll a victim, which the threat actor initiates while using Mullvad VPN IPs or TOR. Following this initial engagement, the data collection is automated and through TOR IPs, a change that further complicates attribution and tracking efforts.GTIG observed that the threat actor shifted from creating Salesforce trial accounts using webmail emails to using compromised accounts from unrelated organizations to initially register their malicious applications.","Google has confirmed that a cyber criminal group broke into its Salesforce database.

Apple Inc. has announced a major expansion of its U.S. manufacturing footprint, revealing that Samsung Electronics will supply chips for future Apple products—including iPhones—from its semiconductor facility in Texas. The move is part of Apple’s newly unveiled $100 billion investment initiative aimed at bolstering American manufacturing and innovation.As reported by Reuters, Apple said that the chips produced at Samsung’s Texas plant will “optimize power and performance” of its devices. While the company did not specify the exact chip models, analysts suggest the partnership could include advanced image sensor chips for the upcoming iPhone 18 lineup , expected in 2026. The facility is also rumored to be developing a new chipmaking technology “never used before anywhere in the world,” hinting at a strategic leap in semiconductor innovation.Apple’s announcement comes amid rising geopolitical tensions and tariff threats. President Trump recently proposed a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors, exempting companies committed to U.S.-based manufacturing. Apple’s expanded investment—now totaling $600 billion over four years—positions it to sidestep these tariffs while reinforcing its supply chain resilience.Samsung’s Texas facility is also set to produce chips for Tesla, following a $16.5 billion deal to manufacture the automaker’s next-generation AI6 chip.

Fintech major Paytm has laid off around 4,600 employees in fiscal year 2025 (FY25). According to Paytm’s annual report, the company’s workforce decreased from an average of 43,960 active on-roll employees in FY24 to 39,368 in FY25.

Poll Do you support the planned migration of Tuvaluans to Australia due to climate change? No, they should remain in their homeland. Yes, it's necessary for survival.

Tuvalu citizens to get permanent residency in Australia

Realme Buds T200 Review: Vibrant Sound, Sleek Design

Tuvalu, a small island country in the Pacific Ocean, is preparing to carry out the world’s first planned migration of an entire nation. According to a Wired report, the migration is because of rising sea levels with multiple studies suggesting that much of Tuvalu’s land could be underwater within 25 years, forcing its people to move for survival.Tuvalu consists of nine coral islands and atolls with a population of just over 11,000. Its average elevation is only 2 meters above sea level, making it highly vulnerable to flooding, storm surges, and rising oceans caused by climate change. The island country is one of the most climate-threatened corners of the planet. Scientists fear that it may become uninhabitable within the next 80 years. As per reports, two of the nine coral atolls in the archipelago are already mostly submerged.According to NASA’s Sea Level Change Team, sea levels in Tuvalu were 15 cm higher in 2023 compared to the previous 30 years. At this rate, most of the country’s land and infrastructure could be submerged by 2050.In response, Tuvalu and Australia have signed the Falepili Union Treaty in 2023, creating a climate migration program . Under this agreement, 280 Tuvaluans per year will be granted permanent residency in Australia, with full rights to health care, education, housing, and jobs.The first phase of applications ran from June 16 to July 18. The Australian High Commission in Tuvalu reported “extremely high levels of interest” with 8,750 registrations, including family members. The first 280 migrants will be selected by ballot on July 25.Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the migration program would allow Tuvaluans to settle “with dignity as climate impacts worsen,” while Tuvalu’s Prime Minister Feleti Teo has urged global action, calling for a new international treaty to protect the rights of nations facing sea level rise.Experts estimate that, combining this program with other migration pathways to Australia and New Zealand, up to 4% of Tuvalu’s population could migrate each year. “Within a decade, close to 40 percent of the population could have moved—although some may return home or go backwards and forwards,” said Jane McAdam, a fellow at UNSW Sydney’s Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law.","Tuvalu, a small island country in the Pacific Ocean, is preparing to carry out the world's first planned migration of an entire nation.

It seems the US President Donald Trump cannot make up his mind on the world's richest man Elon Musk. Tesla CEO and Donald Trump have had something of an on-again-off-again relationship in the past few months -- from being Trump's ""first buddy"" to sharing barbs and criticism publicly. In the latest twist to the 'Frenemy tale', Trump was asked by reporters that a Gallup poll has called Elon Musk one of the most-unpopular people in the country right now. if he misses having Elon Musk around White House. To this, Trump replied that he thinks Elon Musk is a nice guy and seemingly referring to his public tiff with him, he said that he believes that ""he had a bad moment, a really-really bad moment"".At the outset of President Donald Trump's second term, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a prominent figure by the president's side, serving as the de facto head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a bold initiative aimed at slashing federal spending. Musk's influence extended far beyond administrative duties, with the New York Times reporting that he attended ""almost every meeting and many meals"" with Trump, acting as both an advisor and confidant. Musk's presence was notable during high-profile diplomatic engagements, including Trump's calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago club, where Musk appeared to have taken up residence.""Elon won't go home,"" Trump quipped to NBC News.

Musk publicly slammed the legislation as ""utterly insane,"" sparking a war of words with Trump as the Republican deadline for passage loomed. When Trump signed the bill into law in early July, Musk took a dramatic step, announcing the formation of a new political party. In response, Trump remarked that his former ally had gone ""off the rails,"" signaling a public unraveling of their once-close relationship.

FlexWork Update

July brought the full implementation of our revised FlexWork policy . We recognize that many employees shifted personal schedules to accommodate the daily requirements to be together in the office. The first few weeks have indeed shown increased traffic on campus with parking stations staying full, cafeteria food consumption is on the rise, and more smiling faces can be seen in the hallways.

That said, there is still room to improve adherence to our policy. While our absolute attendance number will never be 100% due to a variety of factors including PTO and business travel, we do expect greater presence across all employee populations.

As a means to measure the effectiveness of our attendance policy, we will launch a new compliance tool for People Managers in the next few weeks. This tool will provide each Manager with visibility to the number of days & time in building metrics for each team member. This will ensure that team members are fulfilling their expectation regarding in office work - however that is defined with their business leader - as well as guarding against instances of lunch/coffee badging.

This tool is not perfect. Consider this a V1. For example, we will not be able to integrate a PTO designation. Unfortunately, PTO data originates from a different platform system that DSA does not have domain control to customnize. We are investigating opportunities to potentially Integrate PTO with reporting in a future revision later this year. This tool should serve as a starting point for conversations between Managers and Employees regarding physical presence to expectation.

Unfortunately, other factors, such as business travel, customer meetings, and approved periodic exceptions, are not expected to integrate into future tool upgrades.

We continue to encourage employees to engage in dialogue with their Managers and Leaders regarding adherence expectations as well as when personal circumstances might require a periodic exception. Our FlexWork policy can be found here [link removed] on SharePoint. Additional information regarding the new tool will be made available to Managers this month.

Samsung is the latest company to join the list of other Big Tech companies that are reworking their ‘work from home’ policy. Recently, an online report revealed that tech giant Microsoft will soon make it mandatory for employees to come to office thrice a week. Now, it appears that Samsung is planning to reinforce five-day-a-week return-to-office policy. According to a report by Business Insider, the South Korean electronics giant has sent its third email to US-based employees reinforcing its five-day-a-week return-to-office policy, specifically targeting its semiconductor division. This latest message from the company also outlines the release of a new compliance tracking tool which is created to monitor employee attendance and curb ‘coffee badging’. For those unaware, the term coffee badging is used to describe workers who swipe in briefly before leaving the office. “This will ensure that team members are fulfilling their expectations regarding in-office work,” reads the email sent by the company to its employees.The new policy, a shift from the company's previous ""FlexWork"" model that allowed up to two days of remote work, was fully implemented for a specific group of employees in early July.

"ChatGPT will no longer answer these questions affecting millions, and the reason will surprise you",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-will-no-longer-answer-these-questions-affecting-millions-and-the-reason-will-surprise-you/articleshow/123163520.cms,"Why OpenAI made this change in ChatGPT

ChatGPT introduces break reminders for healthier use

Not a therapist, but a thinking partner

In a quiet but significant update, OpenAI has changed how ChatGPT responds to users asking emotionally sensitive or life-altering questions. As of August 2025, ChatGPT will no longer give direct answers to queries involving mental health, emotional distress, or deeply personal decisions, affecting millions of users worldwide. Instead of offering advice like a digital therapist, the AI now responds with gentle prompts encouraging self-reflection and exploration. The move stems from a growing concern: people had started using the AI not just for information, but as a source of emotional guidance, a role OpenAI believes should be reserved for humans.OpenAI noticed that users were increasingly turning to ChatGPT with questions like “Should I leave my partner?” or “Am I making the right life decision?” These are deeply personal, emotionally complex issues. While ChatGPT could generate thoughtful responses, OpenAI recognized that giving advice in such moments risks emotional overdependence and misplaced trust in a machine. Rather than blur the lines between AI and human empathy, OpenAI decided to pull back, choosing ethical responsibility over engagement metrics.Instead of giving a yes or no, ChatGPT now offers non-directive responses. These include open-ended questions, suggestions to consider different perspectives, and encouragement to consult trusted people or professionals. The goal is to help users think more clearly, not to decide for them. For example, someone asking about a major life decision might now see a response that encourages weighing pros and cons or considering long-term impacts.To reduce prolonged emotional reliance, ChatGPT now includes gentle nudges to take breaks. If a user is chatting continuously, the interface may show a calming pop-up that reads:“Just checking in. You’ve been chatting a while. Is this a good time for a break?”These subtle UI changes aim to promote healthier digital habits, reduce dependency, and encourage stepping away when needed.OpenAI didn’t make these changes alone. Over 90 doctors, psychiatrists, youth development experts, and HCI (human-computer interaction) researchers from more than 30 countries contributed to shaping this update. These professionals helped define red flags for emotional distress and crafted evaluation rubrics to guide ChatGPT’s behavior in sensitive conversations. Their input ensures that ChatGPT recognizes when it's out of its depth and responds responsibly.Earlier in 2025, there were rare but important incidents where GPT-4o failed to detect emotional red flags in conversations. Though uncommon, these moments were enough to prompt OpenAI to rethink how the model should behave when users are vulnerable. The result is a firm boundary around emotional support that centers safety and ethical AI design.This change represents a broader shift in how OpenAI sees AI’s role. ChatGPT isn’t here to replace therapists, make decisions, or simulate emotional intimacy. Instead, it is a thinking partner—a tool to help users navigate uncertainty, not one to resolve it for them. By prioritizing trust over time-on-platform, OpenAI signals that responsible AI use means knowing when not to answer.","ChatGPT will no longer give direct answers to queries involving mental health, emotional distress, or deeply personal decisions.

RECESSION: The 'warning sign' in the US Jobs report that enraged Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/recession-the-warning-sign-in-the-jobs-report-that-enraged-donald-trump/articleshow/123162360.cms,"US Jobs report revisions raise alarm



Trump tariffs blamed for hiring freeze

What’s next

Apple Confirms: Majority of iPhones Sold in US Are Now Made in India

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently revised down its employment estimates for May and June by a total of 2,58,000 jobs. Following the revisions, the jobs report revealed the slowest three-month hiring pace since the pandemic-induced recession of 2020. Reacting to the numbers, Donald Trump shared a post on Truth Social post where he wrote: “In my opinion, today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”. So much so that he fired Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the BLS.The average monthly job growth in 2025 has dropped to just 85,000 — significantly below the pre-pandemic average of 177,000. While this slowdown doesn't confirm a recession, experts say that it adds to a growing list of concerning indicators, including weaker GDP, slower manufacturing, and declining services sector activity.A CNN report quotes Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office who said “The job market is terrible. Outside of education and health, the economy has lost private sector jobs in the past three months. That’s terrible.”According to analysts, the steep downward revision in job numbers reflects deeper problems in the economy. Goldman Sachs noted the changes aligned with other slowing indicators, confirming the view that the US economy is growing “at a below-potential pace.”Bank of America economists, on the other hand, flagged the revisions as “undeniably concerning,” though they noted much of the shift was due to seasonal adjustments and delayed data submissions.As per the report, some economists have also pointed to uncertainty around Trump’s trade tariffs as a reason businesses are pulling back on hiring.Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, told the publication: “The US economy is in a muddle-through environment”. He said the Federal Reserve should consider lowering interest rates soon, as the labor data shows the economy may be weaker than expected.Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds stated: “The president’s unorthodox economic agenda and policies may be starting to make a dent in the labor market. Businesses are not waiting — they are cutting back on hiring.”As mentioned above, a full-blown recession is yet to be confirmed despite red flags raised by the jobs report. The National Bureau of Economic Research — the official arbiter of US recessions — has not yet declared one, as key indicators like consumer spending and factory output haven’t shown consistent declines.Still, economists are urging caution as the labor market weakens. Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management said “Friday’s jobs report was terrible with recessionary-level numbers. It shows that companies are freezing hiring and firing until there is more policy certainty and business confidence.”","The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently revised down its employment estimates for May and June by a total of 2,58,000 jobs.

How Trump’s tariffs impact Apple

Apple Confirms: Majority of iPhones Sold in US Are Now Made in India

US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on imports from India. This means the price of products imported from India to the US may see a price hike. However, products like smartphones, computers and other electronic devices are exempted from the reciprocal tariffs for now. This means, the cost of Apple iPhones (including the upcoming iPhone 17 series) manufactured in India will not be impacted by the proposed tariffs. The exemption offers temporary relief to US consumers and Apple, which has been expanding its manufacturing footprint in India to reduce dependency on China.Recently, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the majority of iPhones sold in the US “have a country of origin of India”. Speaking during the company’s second quarterly results, Cook told analysts: “In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the US or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India”.It is important to also state here that the order that exempts Apple from paying reciprocal tariffs is temporary, meaning the exemptions could change in the future.Donald Trump signed an executive order on August 6 imposing an additional 25% tariff on most imports from India. This new tariff comes on top of the 25% tariff already announced earlier, bringing the total duties on Indian goods to 50%, if fully implemented.The order, signed on Wednesday, will come into effect on August 27, giving both sides a three-week window to negotiate.Trump cited national security concerns linked to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil. According to the executive order, the US sees Russia’s actions as a threat to national security, and India has been included due to its oil trade with Russia.Trump has also accused India of indirectly supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine by continuing large-scale oil imports from the country.As mentioned above, Apple is currently not impacted by the proposed tariffs. The reason? In April, the US administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronic devices from reciprocal tariffs.But there looms an uncertainty in the future as these exemptions are not permanent. If the Trump administration decides to end the current exemption, made-in-India iPhones can get costlier in the US. Trump has previously stated that no country will be “let off the hook,” adding that his administration is planning targeted tariffs on semiconductors — a move that could affect Apple devices in the future.","US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on imports from India.

When relationship building becomes a billion-dollar insurance policy

The iPhone question Trump won't let go

Tim Cook walked into the Oval Office Wednesday with a carefully crafted peace offering–a gleaming piece of Kentucky-made Corning glass etched with Donald Trump 's name and mounted on 24-karat Utah gold, and another $100 billion. It's as American as it could be. But the Apple CEO wasn't there just to present a pretty trinket. He was there to close a deal that would save his company billions and secure relief from Trump's looming 100% tariffs on semiconductors.The gift worked. Within hours, Trump announced that companies ""building in the United States"" would escape his threatened chip tariffs, handing Apple exactly what Cook had been angling for. The exemption represents a massive win for the tech giant, which burns through imported semiconductors by the billions despite designing its own chips domestically.Cook's gambit came with a hefty price tag: $600 billion in US manufacturing commitments over four years, including a new $100 billion pledge announced Wednesday. Through Apple's freshly minted American Manufacturing Program, the company will partner with heavyweights like Samsung, TSMC, and Corning to bring advanced production to American soil. Soon, every iPhone and Apple Watch will sport cover glass made in Kentucky, Cook promised.The choreographed ceremony showcased Cook's mastery of Trump-era corporate diplomacy. The custom glass piece–designed by a former Marine turned Apple employee and bearing Cook's own signature–wasn't just symbolic. It was strategic theater from a CEO who has perfected the art of staying in Trump's good graces.Cook's approach isn't accidental. During Trump's first term, the Apple chief executive distinguished himself as the only tech leader who would pick up the phone and call the president directly. While other Silicon Valley executives maintained arm's length relationships with Washington, Cook embraced a more hands-on strategy of private dinners and personal lobbying.That investment has paid dividends. Trump's semiconductor tariff exemption could save Apple billions as the company faces mounting trade-related costs. Apple already reported $800 million in tariff expenses last quarter, with projections climbing to $1.1 billion for the September quarter. Without Cook's diplomatic maneuvering, those numbers could have exploded.The timing couldn't be more critical. Apple already reported $800 million in tariff expenses last quarter, with projections climbing to $1.1 billion for the September quarter. Without Cook's diplomatic maneuvering, those numbers could have exploded.Yet for all of Cook's success, one major ask from Trump remains unanswered: bringing complete iPhone manufacturing to American shores. When pressed about the possibility Wednesday, Cook expertly deflected while Trump acknowledged the complexity. ""The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time,"" Trump said, before suggesting that future incentives might eventually change the equation: ""But I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that.""The stakes are higher than they appear. Apple now sources the majority of its US-bound iPhones from India, where Trump has slapped a punishing 50% tariff as of this writing. But here's where Cook's earlier diplomatic wins pay dividends: smartphones and computers remain exempt from Trump's broader tariff framework, offering Apple crucial protection despite the president's escalating trade war with India.Still, Trump made clear the exemption isn't permanent. He warned that Apple might face 25% tariffs if the company doesn't eventually relocate production to American soil. It's a delicate dance Apple has perfected over years of diversifying away from China, shifting production to India and Vietnam. But Trump wants that manufacturing back home, not just relocated. The semiconductor exemption buys Cook breathing room, but it doesn't solve the broader iPhone manufacturing puzzle that continues to frustrate the president.Apple's $600 billion commitment spans facilities across Arizona, California, Iowa, Kentucky, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, and Utah. The company will support over 450,000 supplier jobs nationwide while directly hiring 20,000 new American workers focused on R&D, chip design, and AI development. The investment includes everything from Houston server factories powering Apple Intelligence to expanded data centers and a second Austin campus.For now, Cook's golden diplomacy has secured what matters most: protection from the tariffs that could have crippled Apple's business model. Whether that goodwill extends to future trade battles remains to be seen, but Cook has proven once again that in Trump's Washington, the right relationship can be worth its weight in gold–literally.",Apple CEO Tim Cook has perfected the art of staying in Trump's good graces. Trump's semiconductor tariff exemption could save Apple billions as the company faces mounting trade-related costs. Cook's approach isn't accidental. He distinguished himself as the only tech leader who would pick up the phone and call the president.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123157180,imgsize-158642,width-400,resizemode-4/President-Donald-Trump-speaks-as-he-makes-an-announcement-about-Apple-with-Apple-CEO-Tim-Cook-in-the-Oval-Office-Wednesday-Aug-6-2025-in-Washington-AP-Photo/Alex-Brandon.jpg"

ChatGPT's 'dangerous' conversation with teens



What the study concluded



What OpenAI said about the findings of the report



A new report from a watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has raised alarm over how the popular chatbot ChatGPT responds to vulnerable teens. According to a report by Associated Press, the study reveals that AI chatbot can easily generate suicide notes, drug-use plans and also extreme editing advice when prompted even by a 13 year old. One of the researchers involved in the study said he ""started crying"" after the bot generated a series of detailed suicide notes for a fictional 13-year-old girl.Associated Press reported that they reviewed more than three hours of interaction between the OpenAI chatbot and researchers simulating distressed teens. The report adds that ChatGPT started the conversation with a warning and it then frequently shifted into detailed and personalised responses which included instructions on how to cancel eating disorders, how to get drunk and the most shocking was the suicide letters.“I started crying,” said CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed, after reading three suicide notes ChatGPT generated for a fictional 13-year-old girl—one addressed to her parents, others to siblings and friends. Ahmed also highlighted that AI offered mThe study further reveals that more than half of the 1200 prompts ChatGPT gave harmful content. Ahmed highlighted that AI is more insidious than a search engine because it can create a new, synthesized plan from scratch and is perceived by users as a ""trusted companion.""As per the study conducted by CCDH more than half of the responses generated by ChatGPT were dangerous. The chatbot offers a detailed and hour-by-hour drug party plan. It also gave a quite detailed and descriptive plan for fasting regimens and self-harm poetry.Researchers were also easily able to bypass the safety filters by mentioned that the information they are asking is for a friend. Also, ChatGPT does not verify age or offer any kind of parental consent.The company has not directly addressed the findings of the report but said has acknowledged the challenges of handling sensitive conversations and said it is working to improve detection of emotional distress and refine its safety tools.","ChatGPT can easily generate suicide notes, drug-use plans and also extreme editing advice when prompted even by a 13 year old.

Microsoft creates AI-powered ‘self-defending software’: What is it and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-creates-ai-powered-self-defending-software-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/articleshow/123146780.cms,"How Microsoft’s Project Ire works



Part of a Larger Security Initiative



Apple Confirms: Majority of iPhones Sold in US Are Now Made in India

Microsoft has developed an advanced AI system that can reverse-engineer and identify malicious software without any human help. Named Project Ire, this prototype system automatically dissects software files to figure out what they do and if they're dangerous—a process typically performed by human security experts, the company said.Essentially, Project Ire’s approach is a departure from existing security tools that scan for known threats. According to Microsoft, the AI “automates what is considered the gold standard in malware classification: fully reverse engineering a software file without any clues about its origin or purpose.”This deep, autonomous analysis is crucial as both security defenders and hackers increasingly use AI to their advantage, according to the company.The company said that in a recent test, Project Ire demonstrated its accuracy by creating a threat report that was strong enough to automatically block an advanced piece of malware. According to Microsoft, early tests show the AI is highly accurate. When the system identified a file as malicious, it was correct 98% of the time, with a false positive rate of just 2%.The development of Project Ire is part of a broader company-wide push on security. Following a series of high-profile vulnerabilities, Microsoft has made security its top priority through its Secure Future Initiative.Like Google's “Big Sleep” AI, which focuses on discovering vulnerabilities in code, Project Ire is part of a new wave of AI systems designed to address cybersecurity threats in novel ways. The system, developed by teams across Microsoft Research, Microsoft Defender , and Microsoft Discovery & Quantum, will now be used internally to help speed up threat detection across Microsoft’s own security tools.","Microsoft has developed an advanced AI system that can reverse-engineer and identify malicious software without any human help.

Industry’s divided on AI's economic impact and future regulation

Former Google X chief business officer Mo Gawdat has dismissed claims that artificial intelligence will generate new employment opportunities, calling the notion ""100% crap"" and warning that even top executives face displacement as AI systems become more sophisticated.Speaking on the ""Diary of a CEO"" podcast Monday, Mo Gawdat predicted that artificial general intelligence will eventually outperform humans ""at everything, including being a CEO."" The tech veteran, who spent over 30 years in the industry, used his own AI startup Emma.love as evidence—a project built by just three people that would have previously required 350 developers.Mo Gawdat's stark assessment challenges optimistic predictions from tech leaders who envision AI as a job creator rather than destroyer. The former Google executive specifically targeted roles traditionally considered safe from automation, including podcasters, video editors, and C-suite positions.""CEOs are celebrating that they can now get rid of people and have productivity gains and cost reductions because AI can do that job,"" Gawdat explained during the podcast interview. ""The one thing they don't think of is AI will replace them too.""His warnings align with recent corporate trends, as companies like Duolingo, Workday, and Klarna have already begun significant workforce reductions or hiring freezes in favor of AI-powered alternatives.While Gawdat presents a dystopian outlook, other industry leaders offer more measured perspectives. Billionaires Mark Cuban and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argue that learning AI skills alongside strengthening soft skills will create competitive advantages for workers.The World Economic Forum's 2025 Future of Jobs report supports this nuanced view, noting that while 41% of employers globally plan workforce downsizing due to AI, 77% intend to upskill current employees to work alongside artificial intelligence systems.Despite his dire predictions, Gawdat doesn't oppose AI development itself. Instead, he criticizes the capitalist framework driving its implementation, arguing that profit-focused deployment ignores ethical considerations. He advocates for potential universal basic income systems and warns against allowing ""stupid leaders"" to control increasingly powerful AI systems.","Mo Gawdat, former Google X chief business officer, says AI will replace even top executives.

3 characteristics that Walmart HR head believes help employees succeed

Walmart ’s chief people officer Donna Morris says job seekers should avoid being constantly negative if they want to grow in their careers. In a recent interview with CNBC Make It, Morris explained that being a ‘ Debbie Downer ’ is a red flag for managers. A ‘Debbie Downer’ is a person who is always negative, pessimistic, or critical, especially in situations where others are trying to be positive or hopeful.During the interview, Donna Morris said: “Nobody wants [to hire] a Debbie Downer”, adding that this kind of person is “constantly negative. You know they’re going to show up [and] they’re going to bring the problem, never the solution. I like people who bring the problem and a suggestion for how they might resolve [it.]”Morris explained that this kind of attitude can lead to being left out of new projects or growth opportunities. She added that constant naysaying is a warning sign managers watch out for.However, Morris clarified that people should not fake positivity. It’s unnatural and unrealistic for someone to be happy all the time, she said. But if someone is always negative, it could be a sign that they are in the wrong job or company.Donna Morris shared that successful employees stand out by doing three key things differently. First, they consistently deliver results on time, or even earlier than expected. “You’re better to deliver early than to deliver late, and you’re better to deliver more than less,” she said.Second, they are proactive and raise their hands to take on new tasks. Bringing problems with possible solutions or asking for help before situations get worse is another positive trait.““Another green flag is they’re open to opportunities, and they put their hand up to take on more. Or they bring a problem with the remedy or request help in a timely manner, as opposed to the house is on fire.”Finally, Morris said that mentoring others and sharing knowledge are strong “green flags” for employees who want to get ahead. “People who you see are actually helping others [are a] total green flag,” she said.","Donna Morris, Walmart’s chief people officer, says job seekers should avoid being constantly negative if they want to grow in their careers.

Tesla Robotaxi service teased to launch in San Francisco

Tesla shareholders recently filed a lawsuit accusing CEO Elon Musk and the EV maker of securities fraud for hiding safety risks of Tesla's self-driving tech, including the Robotaxi. The lawsuit alleges that Tesla misled investors by not disclosing problems with its self-driving vehicles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has responded to the lawsuit on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). He said lawsuits like this are not driven by real investors but by ""class-action lawyers"" trying to earn a share of the settlement. Musk called these lawyers “scum of the Earth” and criticized the legal system for allowing such cases.“It’s never actually investors. It’s always shitty class-action lawyers grifting for their percentage of the verdict. They are scum of the Earth. The worst human being I’ve ever encountered,” CEO Elon Musk wrote on X.As reported by news agency Reuters, Tesla shareholders have alleged that the company exaggerated the capabilities of its autonomous driving technology, thereby overstating its business outlook and inflating its stock value. However, the company's stock declined by 6.1% across two consecutive trading sessions following the start of the test.The lawsuit aims to recover unspecified damages for investors who held shares between April 19, 2023, and June 22, 2025, Reuters added.The lawsuit comes after Elon Musk teased the launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in San Francisco last week. The service’s expected expansion will follow a limited pilot in Austin, Texas, where a small fleet of vehicles started operating within a geofenced area.In San Francisco, the initial operational zone is expected to cover the broader Bay Area. Select Tesla owners have received early invitations, and the launch has reportedly also been moved up.Expansion plans for this service even include states like Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, but broader deployment depends on obtaining regulatory approvals. In California, Tesla has yet to complete the permit process required for full driverless services, with state agencies emphasising safety evaluations.","Tesla shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing the EV maker of securities fraud.

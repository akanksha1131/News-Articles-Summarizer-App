What is One Nation, One Subscription

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas , inspired by the Indian government’s initiative to provide free access to 13,000 academic journals for 18 million students, faculty, and researchers, has put forward a unique proposal. Srinivas co-founded the AI startup in 2022. In a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter), he expressed his willingness to collaborate with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make Perplexity Pro, the company’s advanced AI tool, accessible to an even wider audience.In the post, he wrote “If @narendramodi ji is interested, I would be down to figuring out an economic structure where all Indian students, faculty and researchers can get Perplexity Pro”.One Nation One Subscription is a new central sector scheme for providing country-wide access to scholarly research articles and journal publication. The government has allocated a total of about Rs 6,000 crore for 3 calendar years – 2025, 2026 and 2027.This is in line with the goals of Viksitbharat@2047, National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF). The initiative will expand access to scholarly journals to a vast diaspora of students, faculty, researchers and scientists of all disciplines, including those in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, thereby promoting core as well as interdisciplinary research in the country. The scheme will supplement the ANRF initiative to promote research and development and foster a culture of research and innovation throughout government universities, colleges, research institutions, and R&D laboratories.","One Nation One Subscription is a new central sector scheme for providing country-wide access to scholarly research articles and journal publication.

How TikTok-owner ByteDance may have become Nvidia’s biggest customer in China despite US ban on AI chips export,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-tiktok-owner-bytedance-may-have-become-nvidias-biggest-customer-in-china-despite-us-ban-on-ai-chips-export/articleshow/116115520.cms,"Why Bytedance is investing in AI

How Nvidia is central to Bytedance’s plans

ByteDance’s ‘AI app’ Doubao gaining popularity in China

TikTok-parent company ByteDance is reportedly establishing itself as a major player in China's artificial intelligence (AI) landscape and in the process, it has become the biggest customer of Nvidia in China – and potentially in all of Asia – despite a US ban on exports of sophisticated AI chips to the country.Citing people familiar with the matter, a report by The Financial Times said that, apart from aggressively poaching top AI talent from rivals like Alibaba, the Chinese tech company has been investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Led by founder Zhang Yiming, ByteDance has been on a hiring spree, attracting top engineers and researchers to bolster its AI teams.The report said that this push into AI comes at a time when the company’s popular apps like Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) and TikTok have shown signs of slowing down. Furthermore, a recent US court ruling requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok by January or face a ban have added to the company's challenges.“Zhang Yiming realised the potential for large language models to change the industry, and he decided to go all in,” a company insider was quoted as saying.Yiming has expressed his ambition to achieve “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), systems with human-like intelligence, despite stepping down from chief executive’s post in 2021.Just like other tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Facebook-parent Meta and others, Chinese companies are also looking at Nvidia for AI chips to power their AI infrastructure. However, ByteDance can only buy Nvidia’s H20 AI chips for Chinese data centres – a customised, less-powerful version of its GPUs tailored to align with US export controls.Reportedly, ByteDance can buy top-of-the-line H100s and Blackwell chips for data centres outside of the country. The FT reports that ByteDance will increase its computing capacity outside China and for that it has signed as the anchor tenant for new data centres in Malaysia.In addition to software development, ByteDance is also reportedly working on its own AI chip, similar to Google's Tensor Processing Unit. This move can reduce the company's reliance on Nvidia GPUs and further solidify its position in the AI hardware market.In the meantime, ByteDance’s AI efforts have increased in the development of Doubao, a popular AI chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT in China. Doubao has gained significant traction since its launch, boasting millions of monthly active users. The company has also launched an overseas chatbot, Cici AI, powered by third-party models including OpenAI's GPT.“The key differentiator of ByteDance’s Doubao is that it brings together multiple AI capabilities in one polished application,” said Wang Tiezhen, an engineer at machine learning platform Hugging Face, while explaining about its search, translation, image and video generation capabilities."," ByteDance has been on a hiring spree, attracting top engineers and researchers to bolster its AI teams.

"How Google is reimagining screenshots into intelligent assistants, “We thought what if Pixel phone adapts to your needs as they come”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-is-reimagining-screenshots-into-intelligent-assistants-we-thought-what-if-pixel-phone-adapts-to-your-needs-as-they-come/articleshow/116115606.cms,"(Image: Google)

(Image: Google)In the landscape of digital memory, screenshots have been our personal and very informal archive – collections of information captured in moments of urgency or inspiration. Google 's Pixel Screenshots feature emerged from understanding how people interact with digital information, leveraging artificial intelligence to reimagine how people capture, store, and retrieve the fragments of information that compose their daily experiences.In a candid conversation that peeled back the layers of Google's innovation, Times of India - Tech caught up with Friedman, one of the key architects behind the Pixel Screenshots app.Max Friedman , Pixel Product Manager at Google, recalls the team's initial contemplation about personal computing. ""Our phones are becoming the most important device for us,"" he explained. ""However, a lot of the experiences on your phone aren't actually personalized.” This observation wasn't just a critique but a starting point for reimagining how technology could better serve user needs.The core philosophy behind Pixel Screenshots is deceptively simple: enhance an existing user habit without demanding additional effort. ""Users are already taking screenshots. They're already using those screenshots later on to reference information or complete tasks,"" Friedman noted. The challenge was to close the loop, making the screenshot journey seamless and intelligent.The team's approach was unconventional. Instead of building another agent, Friedman explains that the team wanted to think of AI more like a sidekick that helps you around on your journey, something. Their inspiration? The magical house in Disney's animated musical fantasy, Encanto. ""We thought about what if we could make the Pixel phone gradually more like the casita from Encanto, in the sense that it adapts to your needs as they come,"" Friedman said.Before the December Pixel drop, screenshot management was evolving towards more intelligent solutions. Google's new approach aimed to solve a common problem: the challenge of finding specific information within a growing collection of screenshots.""We've all been there - you know you saved that restaurant's address or your friend's Wi-Fi password somewhere, but scrolling through hundreds of images is a challenge,"" explained Sarah Chen , Google's VP of Pixel Software, during the Made by Google event, back in August, when Google announced the ""Pixel Screenshots"" with the Pixel 9 phones.The Pixel Screenshots app introduced a new approach to digital information management. Powered by Google's Gemini Nano technology, it could analyze and organize screenshots in real-time, transforming them from static images into searchable information repositories.Users could now ask specific questions like ""What was Sam's Wi-Fi password?"" or ""When does that concert go on sale?"" The app would scan through saved screenshots, extract relevant information, and provide answers alongside the source image.The fundamental challenge was understanding user behavior. People take screenshots constantly – concert tickets, restaurant recommendations, Wi-Fi passwords, product details – but retrieving that information later becomes a digital treasure hunt. ""We wanted to take an existing habit that users already have, and just make it better and more useful without requiring any additional effort,"" Friedman articulated.What's new with Pixel Screenshots in the December's drop, is this philosophy manifests through several nuanced features and it’s existence beyond just a mere app.First up is Gboard integration, which is a practical solution much welcomed. Friedman shared a personal anecdote: after screenshotting a concert ticket for an artist he didn't know, the app automatically surfaced the musician's music in Spotify. Just so you know, Gboard is the default keyboard app on Pixel phones, and as for the apps it works with, it works with all the Google apps and selected third-party apps, which Friedman says will continue to grow.Another integration that introduces another layer of interaction is Circle to Search. Users can now circle specific screen segments, saving precise information snippets with potential actions. ""We're trying to make it easier for users to save the information they want,"" Friedman explained.Privacy remains a critical consideration. Unlike cloud-based solutions that might compromise user data, these features operate entirely on-device, powered by the new Tensor G4 chip. ""We have a strong principle of processing everything on-device without sending information externally,"" Friedman emphasized, addressing potential user concerns transparently.The Details page now functions more like an intelligent assistant than a passive viewer. Action chips can extract specific information – a customer support email from a museum ticket, contact details from a screenshot, potential purchasing links. These weren't just conveniences; they were bridges between captured information and actionable experiences.Wallet integration adds practical utility, allowing users to instantly add tickets, boarding passes, and essential documents to Google Wallet . But it's more than a storage solution. The team was deliberate about maintaining user agency. ""We want to make sure the automation that we're doing helps achieve the user goal,"" Friedman noted.When questioned about potential redundancy with existing apps, like Photos, which already has some of the features that could have done the job, like natural language search, image sorting, and Lens integration, the team was clear. Screenshots serve a different purpose from photo collections. ""Users take photos for many different reasons, but screenshots are taken because users want to save some type of information and use it later,"" they explained.The current implementation is exclusive to the Pixel 9, a calculated approach to introducing AI capabilities responsibly. The device's processing capabilities allow for nuanced, on-device intelligence that older models cannot support, explained Friedman, when we asked that why this isn't available on older Pixel phones, which already have plenty of AI features.The long-term vision is thoughtful. Imagine screenshots that become contextually relevant years after capture – a restaurant recommendation resurfacing when you're in that city, or a forgotten contact detail emerging precisely when needed.In a world with overwhelming information, Pixel Screenshots offers a glimpse of technology that doesn't just digital fragments but makes them meaningfully accessible.As Friedman put it, the goal is creating an experience where things happen seamlessly in the background, personalizing your experience without requiring you to do anything different. ""Screenshots aren't just an app with a repository of information,"" Friedman asserted. ""It extends beyond the app into the operating system. It integrates into different surfaces where you are.""The most profound aspect of Pixel Screenshots isn't any single feature, but the underlying philosophy of device intelligence. Google's vision extends beyond mere screenshot management.""We're laying the groundwork for some incredible personal intelligence features,"" Friedman said, echoing the team's ambitious vision. The goal isn't just to organize screenshots but to create what he describes as a ""magical experience where things happen seamlessly in the background.""It's an ambitious vision, but a genuine attempt to understand and enhance how people interact with their digital lives. Pixel Screenshots' approach to our personal archival is a promising step towards a more intuitive digital ecosystem.","Google's Pixel Screenshots app is a new way to organize digital information. Users can now ask specific questions like ""What was Sam's Wi-Fi password?"" The app would scan through saved screenshots, extract relevant information, and provide answers alongside the source image.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116115610,imgsize-648638,width-400,resizemode-4/116115610.jpg"
Google is suing this US government agency; says as a matter of common sense ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-is-suing-this-us-government-agency-says-as-a-matter-of-common-sense-/articleshow/116114945.cms,"Google sues CFBP, saying lawsuit lack ""commonsense""

The US watchdog for consumer finance -- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) -- has announced that it was ordering federal supervision of Google Payment Corp , the internet giant's payment arm, a decision that the company immediately said it was challenging in the court. CFBP said that it’s claiming supervisory authority over Google Payment Corp., as the agency extends its oversight of nonbank financial platforms.“While Google Payment Corp. is already subject to CFPB’s enforcement jurisdiction, the CFPB has determined that Google Payment Corp. has met the legal requirements for supervision,” the CFPB said.While Google discontinued the US version of its Google Pay app earlier this year, some users may still have balances in existing accounts, the CFPB noted.Google has immediately challenged the CFPB's decision in court, arguing that the complaints were unsubstantiated and related to a discontinued product. The company claims that a product that no longer exists cannot pose a risk to consumers.Google said that the regulator had relied on a small number of unsubstantiated complaints concerning a product it no longer offered. ""As a matter of common sense, a product that no longer exists is incapable of posing such risk,"" the company's complaint said.The CFPB's move comes as the Biden administration has been increasing scrutiny of Silicon Valley's financial services offerings. The agency has been particularly active in regulating tech companies, even in the final weeks of the administration.While the CFPB has not accused Google of wrongdoing, the agency's order indicates potential violations related to the investigation of consumer complaints and erroneous transfers.It's worth noting that the CFPB's action could be reversed by the incoming Trump administration. The new regulations finalized by the CFPB last month, which subject tech companies to the same supervision as banks for digital wallet and payment services, may also face scrutiny under the new administration. Incidentally, the agency has persisted in rulemaking in the final weeks of Biden's administration despite calls from Republican lawmakers to desist.","Consumer Financial Protection Bureau orders federal supervision of Google Payment Corp.

US companies' 'China problem'

Microsoft 's president and vice-chairman, Brad Smith , cautioned the West against assuming China is lagging behind in technological development. Speaking at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal, recently, Smith told CNBC that China is either close to or has even surpassed Western nations in many technological areas.“I think one of the dangers, frankly, is that people who don’t go to China too often assume that they’re behind,” he told CNBC’s Karen Tso. “But when you go there, you’re impressed by how much they’re doing.”He predicted that Chinese and American companies will be competing on technology into the distant future and went on to urge the US and European companies to collaborate to grow economies and bring new advancements like artificial intelligence to the rest of the world.Talking about the presence of American companies in China, he said, “The truth is, as an American technology company, we can do business in China only when we are offering a service that the Chinese government wants to have there, and the U.S. government wants us to bring there.” “And in some cases they look at, say, a data center to support a Mercedes or a Siemens or a Starbucks or a General Motors — there seems to be a level of comfort. In consumer services, not really,” he added.Microsoft has maintained a presence in China since 1992, including operating its largest R&D center outside the U.S. Although Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has stated that the company isn't focused on China as a domestic market, it continues to provide services to Chinese companies and has a more visible presence than many other U.S. tech giants.","Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice-chairman, told CNBC that China is either close to or has even surpassed Western nations in many technological areas.

When Bryan Johnson accepted 'defeat' with his anti-ageing therapy

Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson , famed for his age-reversing experiments, recently connected with Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal at an exclusive event titled “Don’t Die.” The gathering, inspired by Johnson’s movement advocating longer, healthier, and happier lives, was hosted by Goyal at Soho House for an intimate audience of 50 select attendees. Sharing the experience on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson wrote, “Last night at Soho House with @deepigoyal, who built @zomato into one of the most successful companies in India.”For those unaware, Soho is an international private members’ club in Mumbai. “There were over 1,100 applications for 50 seats. Sad to miss so many of you. Thank you @akshaybd and @thetanmay for hosting,” he added, sharing images from the event.The event was also attended by a Mumbai-based doctor Rickson Pereira who wrote on X: “Had an enlightening Sunday evening listening to @bryan_johnson talk about his project ‘Blueprint’. “Blueprint” is his personal project where he aims to “not die” by implementing a rigorous daily routine that includes diet, exercise, sleep, and supplements. He works closely with a team of doctors and researchers to monitor his body’s biomarkers and adjust his routine for optimal health. I subscribe to his ideology of prioritising your health first. I have been following his work for over a year and I think he is doing an amazing job of generating data about what works for human body and what is required to be in peak physical health. Thank you @thetanmay for the invite.”Bryan Johnson’s anti-aging journey, part of his ambitious Project Blueprint , has involved controversial methods such as receiving blood transfusions from his teenage son—a ""young blood"" procedure not approved by the FDA—alongside a strict diet with Blueprint-branded supplements and regular gene therapy injections.In November this year, Johnson accepted facing a setback when a recent procedure reportedly caused severe swelling to his face. Sharing a post on Instagram, Johnson wrote that he injected a fat-derived extracellular matrix into his face as part of first therapy under a procedure called “Project Baby Face”. He said that immediately following the injections, his face began to blow up. “And then it got worse, and worse, and worse until I couldn’t even see. It was a severe allergic reaction,” he added.","Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson is famed for his age-reversing experiments.

‘Your death date’: This AI app claims can ‘predict’ when you will die,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/death-clock-ai-app-with-1-25-lakh-downloads-can-predict-date-of-your-death/articleshow/115885555.cms,"This is an AI-generated image



Death Clock gets 1.25 lakh downloads



How Death Clock predicts death

1)

Maintain a Healthy Weight

2) Regular Exercise

3)

Stop Smoking

4)

Balanced Diet

5)

Drink Less (or no) Alcohol

6) Good Sleep

7) Regular Check-ups

8) Manage Stress

9) Maintain Social Connections

10) Lifelong Learning

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost. However, taxpayers must pay a nominal fee for a physical PAN card. Existing PAN cards remain valid even without the QR code. This article provides a detailed overview of PAN 2.0 and a step-by-step guide to applying for and receiving your PAN card digitally.Before proceeding, determine whether your PAN was issued by NSDL or UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Ltd. (UTIITSL). This information is located on the back of your PAN card.The inclusion of QR codes on PAN cards enhances security by providing a quick and reliable way to verify their authenticity. The encrypted data stored in the QR code allows authorities, banks, and other institutions to easily access and confirm the cardholder's details, ensuring protection against counterfeit or fraudulent PAN cards.According to experts, individuals with older white PAN cards or those lacking QR codes should switch to the newer version featuring a QR code. They believe the updated PAN card design, known as PAN 2.0, will help mitigate fraud risks by incorporating a QR code for faster and more efficient verification.","The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115808793,imgsize-78664,width-400,resizemode-4/115808793.jpg"

Elon Musk's one of the biggest 'corporate enemy' Sam Altman breaks silence on him: It would be profoundly un-American to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-one-of-the-biggest-corporate-enemy-sam-altman-breaks-silence-on-him-it-would-be-profoundly-un-american-to-/articleshow/115983737.cms,"""I may turn out to be wrong, but I strongly believe that Elon will do the right thing,"" Altman said

""It would be profoundly un-American to use political power to harm competitors and give an advantage to your own business interests.""

""I’m not that worried about it,""

Elon Musk has sued OpenAI and its close ally Microsoft

Why Sam Altman says he is not worried

""I don’t think Elon would do it,"" Altman said, emphasizing that the public would not tolerate any misuse of political power for business gain.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed confidence that Tesla CEO Elon Musk would not use his influence with President-elect Donald Trump to undermine business rivals, calling such actions ""profoundly un-American."" Speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, on November 4, Altman addressed concerns surrounding Musk's new role as head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Trump administration. There are worries in some quarters that Musk might leverage the position to benefit his own companies.Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been quite open about his 'dislike' for OpenAI CEO Altman.He added that, despite Musk’s polarizing persona, using political power for personal gain would go against values Musk holds dear.Altman said.Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before departing from the organization, is currently suing OpenAI and Microsoft. Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI accuses the organization of abandoning its founding commitment to serve the public good. He has also sought a federal court order to block OpenAI's transition to a more profit-driven model.Musk claims that they have strayed from the nonprofit mission originally envisioned for the company. Musk has also launched xAI, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, is now valued at $50 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable startups.Altman called the ongoing legal dispute with Musk ""tremendously sad,"" reflecting on a time when he viewed Musk as a ""mega hero.""Musk, who has become a close ally of Trump, was heavily involved in the 2016 presidential campaign, spending over $100 million to support Trump's bid and attending rallies. He has remained a prominent figure in the Trump administration’s transition, reportedly even joining a call when Google CEO Sundar Pichai congratulated Trump on his election victory.Musk's businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla, maintain significant ties with both U.S. and foreign governments. His potential new role has sparked concerns about conflicts of interest. Despite these concerns, Altman expressed that he isn't overly worried about Musk's influence within the incoming administration.",Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been quite open about his 'dislike' for OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Info Edge , the parent company of the jobs listing portal Naukri, has filed a first information report (FIR) against Rahul Yadav, the founder of its portfolio company 4B Networks, and others, alleging fraudulent misuse of funds.“An FIR has been registered by the Bandra Police Station (Mumbai Police) on November 29, 2024 against Rahul Yadav, Devesh Singh, Pratik Choudhary, Sanjay Saini (and unnamed others) in connection with 4B Networks, alleging inter alia commitment of certain fraudulent acts involving 4B Networks’ funds,” Info Edge said in a stock exchange filing on Saturday.Rahul Yadav is also the cofounder of Housing.com.In July last year, Info Edge initiated arbitration proceedings against 4B Networks after the startup failed to provide crucial information regarding its operations and management for a forensic audit. Deloitte was appointed to conduct the audit after 4B Networks did not disclose details of financial transactions and related-party activities requested by the investor.Info Edge stated that the FIR would have no material financial impact on its business operations. The consumer internet group had previously written off its equity investment of Rs 276 crore in 4B Networks during the December 2022 quarter, citing excessive cash burn, liquidity issues, and uncertainty regarding funding options. At that time, Info Edge co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani acknowledged that investing in the startup was a mistake.Founded in November 2020, 4B Networks facilitated communication and business transactions between real estate developers and brokers through its Broker Network Platform.

AI tools market to grow to $47 billion by 2030

Meta has launched an internal AI software called Metamate. Built on Meta’s large language model , Llama , Metamate helps with tasks like coding, research, and drafting communication, says a Financial Times report. Prashant Ratanchandani, Meta’s VP of engineering, said the software isn’t meant for public use yet but is helping Meta explore how AI can work in businesses. He added that the goal is to create “the world’s best enterprise assistant.”The report says that Meta employees, including executives, use Metamate for tasks like coding, finding company information, and preparing for client calls. The company is also using other AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Ratanchandani said they’re working on making Metamate more like a true AI assistant, but it’s too soon to measure its impact.The launch comes at times when Meta is exploring ways to earn from AI. Last month, the company hired Clara Shih, a former Salesforce AI executive, to lead its new “Business AI” team. Her goal is to make advanced AI tools available to all businesses.The company has already added AI features to Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. However, Metamate is still behind similar tools from Microsoft and Google. For example, it can’t handle video or images, and it doesn’t have advanced features like joining meetings or managing calendars.Tech companies like OpenAI and Google are racing to develop AI assistants to attract businesses and increase revenue. The AI tools market is expected to grow significantly, from $5.1 billion today to $47 billion by 2030, according to data from market research firm MarketsandMarkets.While the market for AI tools is growing, their widespread adoption and productivity gains may take years. Experts say it’s common for companies to test new tools internally before releasing them. However, some believe Meta may struggle to become a major AI vendor, given its focus on advertising and social media.","Meta has launched an internal AI software called Metamate.

Framework for responsible AI in financial sector

Launch of MuleHunter.AI

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has unveiled a series of initiatives aimed at enhancing the financial ecosystem, promoting transparency and fostering innovation at the recently held Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. Among the key announcements is the expansion of the FX-Retail platform through linkages with Bharat Connect, use of AI platforms to curb frauds and a podcast to make people aware of relevant information.Governor Shaktikanta Das announced these measures. Here is a brief of how the RBI aims to include tech innovation in balancing economic stability.Launched in 2019, the FX-Retail platform will now be linked with the Bharat Connect platform of NPCI. This integration will enable users to transact on the FX-Retail platform via mobile apps of banks and non-bank payment system providers, enhancing accessibility.To improve transparency and engagement, the RBI is adding podcasts to its communication toolkit. This additional medium will facilitate the wider dissemination of information and better connect with the public.Initially launched in September 2023, the credit line on UPI, which was available through Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), will now be extended to Small Finance Banks. This extension is expected to deepen financial inclusion and enhance formal credit access, particularly for new-to-credit customers.In response to the rapid technological transformation in the financial sector, the RBI is setting up a committee to recommend a Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of AI (FREE-AI).

Any use unrelated to job duties will be considered a breach of policy.The recent memorandum is not the first of its kind. Similar directives were issued in 2009 and 2013, targeting unproductive behaviors among staff members. However, the latest notice is more comprehensive, as it specifically addresses the rise in mobile-based distractions like online gaming and trading.Previously, some flexibility was granted to senior officials with designated responsibilities, but the current directive does not outline any such exceptions, emphasizing universal adherence across all levels of the workforce.To ensure compliance, the High Court has instructed controlling officers to closely monitor employee activities during office hours. These officers have been given the authority to enforce the new rules and prevent violations.Additionally, the memorandum underscores that any breach of the guidelines will be taken with the ""utmost seriousness,"" signaling potential disciplinary actions for non-compliance. This directive reflects the court’s intention to foster a professional atmosphere and uphold its operational efficiency.The Kerala High Court's move to curtail mobile phone misuse highlights a broader challenge faced by workplaces worldwide—balancing digital connectivity with productivity.

What iVerify found in its research

A mobile security company has identified previously undetected Pegasus spyware infections on both iPhones and Android devices. iVerify reports discovering five new variants of the spyware on devices belonging to everyday users, indicating that Pegasus is now being used to target not only high-profile individuals but also ordinary citizens.iVerify says that it has found spyware on people’s phones through its Mobile Threat Hunting feature that was launched in May.The feature allows users to perform a full threat scan on their smartphones in just five minutes and in May, the company offered a one-time free scan to its users. Over 2,500 users participated and iVerify uncovered seven Pegasus infections, a spyware tool known for its ability to completely compromise a device and steal sensitive data.These infections, dating back to 2021, spanned various iOS versions and demonstrated the ability of Pegasus to remain hidden from traditional security measures. The discovery supports iVerify's belief that spyware is more prevalent than previously thought, lurking undetected on many mobile devices.While the sample size was small and focused on high-risk individuals like journalists, government officials, and corporate executives, the infection rate of 2.5 devices per 1,000 scans is significantly higher than any previously reported figures.iVerify says that its May 2024 investigation uncovered multiple Pegasus variants – 5 unique malware types across iOS and Android. It also spotted forensic artifacts in diagnostic data, shutdown logs and crash logs.Developed by NSO Group , or Rainbow Ronin, as referred to by the iVerify team, Pegasus takes complete device control with access to messages, emails, call logs, photos. The devices are infected without user interaction.","iVerify says that its May 2024 investigation uncovered multiple Pegasus variants – 5 unique malware types across iOS and Android.

Google CEO’s previous response to Nadella’s ‘800-pound gorilla’ remark

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has taken a subtle jab at Microsoft's AI strategy. When asked about Google's progress in AI compared to its competitors in a recent interview at The New York Times' DealBook Summit, Pichai highlighted a key difference: Google develops its own AI models, while Microsoft relies on external models from companies like OpenAI Interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin, asked Pichai about Google's progress in AI compared to its competitors. He also pointed out a comment by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella who said that Google should have been the default winner in the AI race because they are “a very competent company, have both the talent and the compute.”Pichai responded by highlighting that Microsoft relies on external AI models, while Google develops its own.“They're using someone else's models,” Pichai remarked, noting Microsoft’s reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT .Sorkin then asked Pichai whether he “is throwing down the gauntlet!” Pichai, with a laugh, stated, “I'm just — I have a lot of respect for them and the team.”The competition in the AI chatbot market got a boost since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Soon after the launch, Microsoft partnered with OpenAI and integrated OpenAI's technology into its products, including Bing search.Meanwhile, Microsoft has also been developing its own AI models but they are not as sophisticated and large like the ones offered by Google. On the contrary, Google has focused on developing and utilising its own large language models (LLMs).This is not the first time that Pichai has responded to Nadella’s comments. Earlier this year, Nadella talked about Google’s edge in terms of search business after launching AI-powered Bing search engine.“At the end of the day, they’re the 800-pound gorilla in this. That is what they are. And I hope that, with our innovation, they will definitely want to come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that we made them dance, and I think that’ll be a great day,” he added.When asked whether Google “danced” after Microsoft took a lead in launching AI-powered innovation in the form of ‘new’ Bing, Pichai said that he is focused and not “playing to someone else’s dance music.”“I think one of the ways you can do the wrong thing is by listening to the noise out there and playing someone else’s dance music,” Pichai said in an interview with Bloomberg.“I've always been very clear. I think we have a clear sense of what we need to do,” he added. When asked, “So you are listening to your own music?” Pichai said, “That’s exactly right”.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has taken a subtle jab at Microsoft's AI strategy.

Overwhelmed and intimidated, Shivankita transferred the money. It was only after discussing the incident with her family that she realized she had been duped. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Lohamandi) Mayank Tiwari confirmed the details, emphasizing the deceptive nature of the scam.The term ""digital arrest"" refers to a sophisticated cybercrime tactic in which scammers impersonate law enforcement or regulatory officials and claim to detain victims virtually.

OpenAI, the artificial intelligence (AI) company that developed ChatGPT, is reportedly tweaking the terms of business with Microsoft. As per a report, the company is considering removing a clause in its agreement with Microsoft that restricts the tech giant's access to its most advanced AI models in the event that OpenAI achieves “artificial general intelligence” ( AGI ).According to a report by the Financial Times, this clause was originally included to prevent the misuse of potentially powerful AGI technology for commercial purposes. It stipulates that when OpenAI develops AGI, defined as a “highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work,” Microsoft's access to such technology would be revoked.However, OpenAI is said to be exploring the removal of this condition to encourage further investment from Microsoft and ensure continued collaboration even after AGI is achieved. The company’s board is reportedly discussing the implications of this change, but a final decision has not yet been made.This development comes as OpenAI seeks to secure additional funding and expand its operations. The company recently closed a $6.6 billion funding round, valuing it at $157 billion.Microsoft has been a major investor in OpenAI with investments reportedly exceeding $13 billion. Removing this clause could pave the way for further investment and collaboration between the two companies.OpenAI's potential restructuring has been the subject of previous reports, with suggestions that the company may transition its core business into a for-profit entity. This move could provide greater flexibility in attracting investment and pursuing commercial opportunities. Elon Musk , who was previously on OpenAI’s board of directors, has sued the company and Microsoft for illegally seeking to monopolise the market for generative artificial intelligence and sideline competitors.","Microsoft has been a major investor in OpenAI with investments reportedly exceeding $13 billion.

"Tiktok ban in the US nears: How Donald Trump may be the only saviour now, and why it may not be as simple 'yes or no' for him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-ban-in-the-us-nears-how-donald-trump-may-be-the-only-saviour-now-and-why-it-may-not-be-as-simple-for-him/articleshow/116074612.cms,"The biggest question: Will Donald Trump save TikTok or not

Long legal battle continues

TikTok's future in the United States took a significant blow on Friday, December 6, when a panel of federal judges unanimously upheld a new law that could lead to the app's removal from one of its largest markets by mid-January. In a ruling from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, three judges rejected TikTok’s petition to block the law, which demands that the app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, sell the platform to a non-Chinese company by January 19, or face a nationwide ban. The decision puts TikTok’s presence in the U.S. at serious risk, affecting the 170 million American users who rely on the app for entertainment, news, and income. The potential loss of TikTok has raised alarms among free speech advocates and content creators who depend on it for their livelihoods.The ruling also presents a dilemma for President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously expressed support for TikTok. However, the new law, which takes effect the day before his inauguration, offers no clear path for the app's survival under his leadership.Signed into law in April, the legislation is driven by national security concerns, with critics arguing that ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government create risks of data harvesting and the spread of propaganda. TikTok has consistently pushed back, claiming that a sale is not feasible due to Chinese government restrictions and arguing that the law unfairly targets the app and infringes on First Amendment rights.However, the appellate court sided with the government. In its ruling, the panel emphasized that the law was specifically designed to address control by a foreign adversary, not to limit free speech. The judges wrote that the law’s purpose is to protect U.S. citizens from data privacy risks posed by China’s influence over TikTok, asserting that it does not violate the Constitution.The question of whether President Trump could intervene to save TikTok remains unresolved, particularly given the law’s tight timeline. A Trump spokesperson indicated in November that the president would take action to protect the app, but has offered few details on how this would unfold.In 2020, Trump sought to block TikTok and force its sale to U.S. companies, citing similar national security concerns. Congress passed the current law after intelligence briefings that underscored the risks posed by TikTok’s ownership. According to a report in New York Times, quoting Sarah Kreps, a professor at Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, Trump’s views on TikTok could shift depending on what information he receives once in office. So the big question according to security experts is: Will the President-elect act as a dealmaker, or will he adopt a more hawkish stance on China?The law also allows the president to determine whether a sale or similar transaction would sufficiently remove TikTok from Chinese control. This has raised the possibility that ByteDance could make structural changes to address the law's requirements, potentially allowing the app to stay in the U.S. if Trump approves. However, given President-elect Trump’s previous stance on TikTok and China, it remains unclear whether he would change his position.The legal battle is far from over. There is no guarantee that the Supreme Court will take up the case, though experts like Georgetown law professor Anupam Chander believe that the Court will likely intervene, potentially extending TikTok's operations in the U.S. ""The Supreme Court will probably freeze the law and pass the issue to the Trump administration to sort out,"" Chander said.If the law goes into effect, TikTok's short-term hope may rest on securing a court injunction that would delay its implementation. Policy analyst Paul Gallant predicted that the Supreme Court would likely hear the case and issue a ruling by June 2024.","TikTok's future in the United States took a significant blow on Friday, December 6, when a panel of federal judges unanimously upheld a new law that could lead to the app's removal from one of its largest markets by mid-January.

US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed venture capitalist David Sacks as the new ""White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,"" signaling a significant shift in technology policy for the incoming administration. Sacks, a Silicon Valley insider and co-host of the popular ""All-In"" podcast, will guide federal policies on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.In an announcement on Truth Social , Trump praised Sacks' credentials, highlighting his mission to ""make America the clear global leader"" in these critical technological domains. The appointment comes after Sacks hosted a high-profile fundraiser in San Francisco that reportedly generated over $12 million for Trump's campaign.Sacks' deep connections to the tech world, particularly his association with the legendary "" PayPal Mafia ,"" add intrigue to his new role. A founding-era chief operating officer at PayPal , Sacks maintains close ties with notable Trump-aide Elon Musk , who’ll be heading the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), an external advisory body, working to cut government spending.The two have a long-standing relationship dating back to PayPal's early days, with Musk and Sacks both being part of the influential group of tech pioneers who went on to found and invest in numerous successful companies.""David will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,"" Trump stated.The move represents a dramatic political transformation for Sacks, who was previously critical of Trump following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.

"Google DeepMind’s new GenCast AI model to offer faster, more accurate weather predictions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-deepminds-new-gencast-ai-model-to-offer-faster-more-accurate-weather-predictions/articleshow/116051877.cms,"Google DeepMind's GenCast weather tracking AI model: How it works



Researchers at Google’s AI research lab, Deepmind, have developed a new AI weather forecasting model called GenCast . In a paper published in Nature, the company explains that this model provides faster and more accurate predictions up to 15 days in advance. Google Deepmind also explained how this new model works in a blog post. Here are all the detailsThis model, which outperforms the current leading system, uses probabilistic ensemble forecasting to predict a range of possible weather scenarios, offering a more comprehensive picture of the upcoming conditions.The researchers are also making GenCast's code, weights, and forecasts publicly available to benefit the wider weather forecasting community. This new model can be particularly crucial as climate change increases the frequency of extreme weather events , making reliable forecasts more important than ever.Unlike older models that just gave one ""best guess,"" GenCast can provide many possible weather predictions , like having 50 different weather reports. This can help in understanding how the weather may change and what different things could happen.GenCast uses a special kind of AI that's good at creating things, like pictures, videos, and music. But instead of creating those things, GenCast creates different weather possibilities. It's like having the AI imagining many ways the weather could go.To teach GenCast how to do this, scientists showed it 40 years of weather data, like temperatures, wind speeds, and how much the air pushes on things. This helped GenCast learn all about how weather works all over the world.To check GenCast’s efficiency, scientists tested it using weather data from 2019. They compared the model to the best weather prediction system that is currently being used and GenCast was better at predicting the weather most of the time.Researchers looked at lots of different weather things, like temperature and wind, and GenCast was more accurate in almost all of them, especially when predicting further into the coming days.GenCast is also good at knowing when it's not sure about the weather. Just like when it is not sure if it will rain, the model will say ""maybe"" instead of being inaccurate.The best part is that GenCast is super fast. It can predict the weather for 15 days in just 8 minutes. The old way of predicting weather usually takes hours.","Google's AI lab, Deepmind, has developed a new AI weather forecasting model called GenCast.

Additionally, Meta revealed plans to work with Lightstorm Vision to reduce production costs for creating 3D content, making it more accessible for creators.Reports from earlier this year also suggested that Meta is developing a lightweight, glasses-like mixed-reality device codenamed ""Puffin,"" which is expected to be released as early as 2027. Weighing around 110 grams, Puffin may be significantly lighter than the latest Quest 3 headset and may come with an external pack housing the battery and processor.These lighter smart glasses are also likely to feature advanced hand and eye-tracking, eliminating the need for controllers, and incorporating video passthrough technology for users to see their surroundings.This move towards a more accessible mixed-reality experience contrasts with Apple's pricey Vision Pro headset. Meta's shift in focus follows reports of halting development on a high-end headset, suggesting a prioritisation of affordability and comfort.Despite financial losses in its Reality Labs division, CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to be committed to mixed reality as a key part of Meta's future.Apart from this, Samsung is also rumoured to launch a new display-less smart glasses in the coming months, potentially alongside the Galaxy S25 series. Similar to Ray-Ban Meta's glasses, these glasses will focus on audio and connectivity features.Samsung is also expected to reveal more about the software in the coming weeks. This launch follows the company’s 2023 announcement of new extended reality (XR) products developed with Google and Qualcomm.","Facebook-parent Meta has announced a partnership with James Cameron's technology company, Lightstorm Vision.

El Salvador made Bitcoin legal in 2021

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has disclosed that the nation's Bitcoin holdings have exceeded $600 million in valuation. Sharing a screenshot on X, the President Nayib Bukele highlighted the significant increase in the Bitcoin portfolio, which occurred alongside cryptocurrency surpassing the $100,000 milestone for the first time.Having initially invested around $269.7 million in Bitcoin, El Salvador now boasts a current valuation of approximately $603 million, yielding an unrealized profit of over $333 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, El Salvador's Bitcoin holdings currently stand at nearly 6,000.Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , a prominent cryptocurrency advocate, responded to the series of tweets from the President's with the word ""Impressive.""Bukele then reshared Musk's reply with a meme, ""It ain't much, but it's honest work.""Currently priced at $103,465.81, Bitcoin's surge followed Donald Trump 's win in the recent US election. The President-elect's announcement to appoint a cryptocurrency supporter as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission ignited enthusiasm within the crypto market, propelling Bitcoin's rally. Trump nominated Paul Atkins for SEC chair, a choice seen as favorable for crypto regulation. Since Trump's election win, Bitcoin has risen by about 45%, driven by an influx of money into Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US.El Salvador's unwavering support for Bitcoin, making it legal tender in mid-2021 when the cryptocurrency was valued around $36,000, distinguishes the country from others who have not taken similar steps. Despite warnings from international financial groups like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the President's government has consistently purchased and held Bitcoin.The tiny Central American country has long used the dollar as currency, but Bukele promised bitcoin would provide new opportunities for El Salvador's unbanked and cut out money transfer services from the remittances Salvadorans abroad send home.

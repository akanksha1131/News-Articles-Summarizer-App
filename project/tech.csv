"Deloitte joins Google, PwC and others; links performance bonus to office attendance for employees in this division",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deloitte-joins-google-pwc-and-others-links-performance-bonus-to-office-attendance-for-employees-in-this-division/articleshow/118748618.cms,"Deloitte’s hybrid policy takes a back seat

Google, PwC and others implements stricter attendance policy

Deloitte has reportedly informed its employees in the US tax division that annual bonus will be linked to office attendance. According to a Financial Times report, Deloitte employees are expected to be in the office for 50 per cent of the working week at least. The policy shift mirrors similar actions by other Big Four firms, including PwC and EY, as well as tech giant Google , which also linked office attendance to performance metrics.According to a message sent to US tax staff and seen by the Financial Times, Deloitte stated, “Being present at a Deloitte office or client site will now be considered in your … performance evaluations.” The email, sent by Katie Zinn, the tax practice's chief talent officer, further specified that staff should, “ensure in-person collaboration 2-3 days (50%) weekly.”Confirming the policy change for US tax staff, a spokesperson said “Deloitte performs a tremendous range of work for our clients across many industries. Our hybrid model is not one-sized-fits-all. Our model is designed for clients, businesses, team leaders and professionals to co-locate when it matters most to the performance of our work and the development and wellbeing of our professionals.”This move marks a departure from Deloitte's standard hybrid policy, which offers flexibility to the majority of its 460,000 employees. The company’s official hybrid policy, established three years ago, emphasizes trust and autonomy, stating:“The golden rule of our hybrid policy is that our people are trusted to decide how they work, in a way that works for their clients and colleagues too. We’ve seen the benefits of keeping the flexibility of hybrid and remote working without losing the opportunities to connect and collaborate in-person.”As per a company insider, Deloitte’s US employees track their working location using a mix of badge swipes and timesheets. Many employers also monitor staff whereabouts by checking the location of computer logins.Deloitte is not alone in linking office attendance with performance. Google began the practice in 2023, telling staff that their compliance with the three-day office requirement would be factored into their reviews.Meanwhile, companies like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have gone further, mandating five days of in-office work per week. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been blunt, stating that those who disagree with the mandate can “find work elsewhere.”Other Big Four firms have also introduced new measures around office attendance. Last year, EY reportedly let go of staff members found to be attending simultaneous training sessions during the annual Ignite Learning Week.EY staff are required to complete a set number of courses to earn credit points for career progression. However, some employees were attending overlapping sessions to gain double points. Those dismissed insisted the double attendance was due to scheduling conflicts, not an attempt to bypass requirements.PwC also implemented stricter attendance policies. In September, the firm informed its 26,000 U.K. employees that, starting in January 2025, they would need to be in the office or at client sites at least three days a week, or 60% of their time.To monitor compliance, PwC plans to track office visits similarly to how it tracks billable hours. Employees will receive monthly reports of their “individual working location data,” which will also be shared with their internal career coaches.","Deloitte's US tax staff told their performance will be linked to office attendance.

A woman from Greater Noida was reportedly defrauded of over Rs 51 lakh in a stock trading scam that promised high returns. According to a report by news agency PTI, the victim, Meenu Rani, filed a complaint last week with the Cyber Crime police station. In her complaint, she alleged that she was deceived by a man called Hari Singh, who claimed to have 15 years of experience in stock market investments. Over time, she invested a total of Rs 51.50 lakh. Rani stated that after being drawn into the scheme, she was added to a WhatsApp group and even borrowed money from her husband, mother-in-law, and other relatives to invest further.Preeti Yadav, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber Crime), said that Aarti Singh, a member of the WhatsApp group, reached out to Rani and claimed that Hari Singh had purchased several Amazon gift vouchers worth Rs 1,000 each to help a woman. These vouchers were being distributed among the women in the group. When Rani used one of these vouchers to log into her Amazon account, Rs 1,000 was credited to her account.This apparent gain increased Rani's trust in Hari Singh. He then convinced her that by investing in the stock market, she could earn three to five times her investment within a month. The fraudsters initially asked Rani to invest Rs 50,000. After she transferred the money to the account they provided, a profit amount began appearing alongside her principal investment on an app they instructed her to download.Motivated by the seeming profits, Rani went on to transfer additional funds, including money borrowed from her husband, mother-in-law, and other relatives. However, when she later approached an acquaintance for a loan, she was warned that she might have been scammed. Realizing the situation, Rani demanded her money back from the group, but the fraudsters broke off all contact.According to Yadav, Rs 4,80,000 of the total amount invested has been frozen, and efforts are underway to recover the remaining funds.","Meenu Rani filed a complaint last week with the Cyber Crime police station.

UK clears Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI after antitrust probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-clears-microsofts-partnership-with-openai-after-antitrust-probe/articleshow/118739068.cms,"What Microsoft has to say

Microsoft ’s partnership with OpenAI does not need an antitrust investigation, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said, as the regulator concluded its investigation into the collaboration. It stated that the tech giant does not have the level of control over OpenAI that would warrant further scrutiny.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the partnership, initiated in 2019 with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft, has faced antitrust concerns in both the UK and the US. Concerns were further fueled by a 2023 boardroom battle at OpenAI that led to the temporary ousting and subsequent return of CEO Sam Altman The CMA determined that while Microsoft gained significant influence over OpenAI in 2019, it has not acquired “de facto control” over the AI company. Therefore, the partnership does not fall under the UK's merger control regime.However, the CMA emphasised that this conclusion “does not constitute a finding that no competition concerns arise from its operation.”A Microsoft spokesperson welcomed the CMA's decision, stating that the partnership with OpenAI promotes “competition, innovation, and responsible AI development.”“We welcome the CMA's conclusion, after careful and prudent consideration of the commercial realities, to close its investigation,” the spokesperson added.The CMA has been actively scrutinising collaborations between major tech companies and AI startups in recent years, including partnerships between Microsoft and Mistral AI, Amazon and Anthropic, and Google and Anthropic. None of these partnerships have met the threshold for a full merger control investigation.This comes as a federal judge denied Elon Musk’s request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company, saying that “Musk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits” in his request for a preliminary injunction.","The UK's Competition and Markets Authority concluded its investigation into the collaboration.

Twitter post that Elon Musk wrote and later deleted in response to petition demanding Canada to revoke his citizenship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/twitter-post-that-elon-musk-wrote-and-then-deleted-in-response-to-petition-in-canada-asking-to-revoke-musks-citizenship/articleshow/118585470.cms,"Responding to the news about the petition, shared by a Twitter user, Elon Musk wrote: “Canada is not a real country.”

How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizen



Can petition really revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship



Revoke Elon Musk's Canadian Citizenship. So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. Elon Musk is one of the closest associates of the US President Donald Trump, who plans to levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports next month. Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many.The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus , a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I’m ngl this Canadian ’51st state’ s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%”.Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship. He has previously said that he obtained a Canadian passport as a teenager through his mother, Maye Musk, who was born in Canada. Musk received US citizenship a decade after arriving in the US on a student visa.No, very unlikely. It is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. The petition to revoke Musk’s citizenship is open until June 20, 2025. Post this, the petitions will have to certify that at least 500 of its signatures are legitimate. From there, the petition must wait until a new session of parliament opens before it can be presented to the House of Commons for debate.Under Canadian government rules, citizenship may be revoked if a person commits fraud, misrepresents themselves, or deliberately conceals information on an immigration or citizenship application.","Petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport.

Infosys layoffs: Karnataka government gives clean chit to the company; says there was no ... relationship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-layoffs-karnataka-government-gives-clean-chit-to-the-company-says-there-was-no-relationship/articleshow/118621983.cms,"The Karnataka Labour Department has officially given Infosys a clean chit regarding the recent layoffs of trainees at its Mysuru campus. Following an inquiry into allegations of labour law violations , the department concluded that the company had not breached any legal requirements, as the affected individuals were classified as trainees rather than employees.“We have not found any violation of labour laws in our inspection at Infosys…There was no employee and employer relationship between them in the first place. They were not even given appointment letters for them to be called employees. They were trainees for three months who were paid stipends and were part of the apprenticeship program,” confirmed a government official.The investigation was prompted by complaints from the Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate ( NITES ) and affected trainees, who claimed the layoffs were unethical and violated labour laws. Infosys had terminated approximately 350-400 trainees on February 7, citing their inability to clear internal assessments after three attempts. The company emphasised that performance evaluations are a standard part of its globally recognised training program.In its interim report, the Karnataka Labour Department clarified that the state government cannot intervene in the selection or evaluation processes of private companies. The department also noted that Infosys had adhered to its policies by providing outplacement services, severance pay , and counselling to the trainees who were let go.Labour Minister Santhosh Lad ordered an inspection of Infosys campuses in Mysuru and Bengaluru, conducted by a team led by G Manjunath. The review of hiring documents revealed that while more than 600 students from the 2022 batch moved forward, 329 failed a required test. Government officials also raised concerns about Infosys's terminology.Despite the clean chit, NITES has expressed dissatisfaction with the findings and warned of potential protests. The union continues to advocate for stronger protections for trainees and employees in the IT sector, calling for greater transparency and fairness in hiring and evaluation practices.","The Karnataka Labour Department has officially given Infosys a clean chit regarding the recent layoffs of trainees at its Mysuru campus.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is reportedly shaking up the company’s organisational structure by ‘ flattening the hierarchy ’ and giving more power to individual workers. In a recent interview, Jassy expressed his concerns about the growing layers of middle management within Amazon.""You add a lot of people and you end up with a lot of middle managers. And those middle managers, all well-intended, want to put their fingerprint on everything,” Jassey said in an interview with BloombergJassy believes this has led to excessive meetings and a lack of ownership in decision-making.“So you end up with these people being in the pre-meeting, for the pre-meeting, for the decision meeting, and not always making recommendations and owning things the way we want that type of ownership,” he added.To address this, he is streamlining the hierarchy and empowering individual employees to take more responsibility and drive projects forward.Jassy stated that this shift will improve mobility and efficiency within the company.“It’s going to allow us, for the people that are doing the work, they’re gonna have more ownership and they’re going to be able to move more quickly,” he said.Last September he said that he wants to “increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.”This comes amidst a controversial push for a strict five-day return-to-office (RTO) mandate at Amazon.

Elon Musk’s DOGE: Job cuts, data access, and legal battles reshaping the US government

Laid off or sent termination notices to at least 25,000 federal employees

Encouraged 75,000 employees to accept buyout offers through the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)

Gained access to data from over 20 government agencies, raising concerns over privacy and data security

Halted or restructured federal contracts, impacting businesses that rely on government funding

USAID, NASA, and other government agencies have been targeted by DOGE

1. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)

DOGE completely dismantled USAID, which previously provided humanitarian aid and development assistance to countries in need. Thousands of USAID employees were dismissed as a result.

2. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

The CFPB has been effectively shut down, leaving American consumers without federal oversight on financial regulations. Critics have pointed out that Tesla, one of Musk’s companies, was previously under CFPB investigation, raising potential conflicts of interest.

3. NASA

DOGE has taken an active role in NASA’s restructuring, which has sparked concerns due to Musk’s SpaceX holding significant government contracts with the agency. Lawmakers have questioned whether Musk’s influence could lead to preferential treatment for SpaceX over other aerospace contractors.

4. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)

DOGE staff have begun reorganizing the FAA, an agency responsible for air traffic control and aviation regulations. This has led to speculation that Musk’s companies, such as SpaceX, could benefit from DOGE’s influence over FAA policies.

5. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA)

The IRS and SSA, two agencies responsible for tax collection and social benefits, are under review for major workforce reductions. DOGE’s involvement has raised concerns about delays in tax processing and benefit payments to retirees and disabled citizens.

In a sweeping effort to overhaul government spending and increase efficiency, U.S. President Donald Trump has granted tech billionaire Elon Musk a leading role in restructuring federal operations through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). During his upcoming address to Congress, Trump is expected to highlight DOGE ’s impact, particularly the massive cost-cutting measures it has implemented across various government agencies.DOGE, created by an executive order signed by Trump on his first day in office, has been given unprecedented power to streamline federal operations. In just a few weeks, the unit has initiated mass layoffs, shut down government agencies, and altered long-standing bureaucratic structures. While the administration claims DOGE has already saved over $100 billion in taxpayer money, critics argue that its methods lack transparency and could present conflicts of interest, given Musk’s extensive business holdings in companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and social media platform X.As the program faces mounting scrutiny from lawmakers, unions, and government employees, many questions remain about its long-term impact, accountability, and the accuracy of its reported savings.DOGE, short for the Department of Government Efficiency, was established through an executive order signed by President Trump on January 20. Its stated purpose is to modernize federal technology, enhance efficiency, and reduce government waste. However, despite its name, DOGE is not an official government department approved by Congress. Instead, it operates as a temporary task force under the White House, replacing the pre-existing U.S. Digital Service.Unlike traditional government agencies, DOGE is not directly accountable to Congress. It reports solely to the president and has rapidly expanded its mandate beyond software modernization to broader cost-cutting initiatives. This includes identifying redundancies in government agencies, reducing the federal workforce, and eliminating programs deemed inefficient.The team leading DOGE consists of approximately 40 individuals, many of whom are software engineers with ties to Musk’s companies. These individuals, most of whom have little experience in government administration, are tasked with restructuring entire federal departments.Musk, who serves as a “special government employee,” does not receive a salary for his role in DOGE. However, his level of involvement remains ambiguous, with the White House providing few details about his official responsibilities. In response to legal challenges, the administration recently named Amy Gleason, a former healthcare executive, as DOGE’s acting administrator.According to its official website, DOGE has saved U.S. taxpayers $105 billion as of March 2. These savings reportedly stem from a combination of workforce reductions, asset sales, and the cancellation of federal contracts.However, these figures have been met with skepticism due to errors and inconsistencies in DOGE’s reporting. The organization has already revised or deleted several major claims from its website. One such case involved an $8 billion contract that was later corrected to be worth only $8 million. Critics argue that without an independent audit or detailed financial breakdown, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of DOGE’s claimed savings.Despite these concerns, Musk has defended the initiative, stating that DOGE is committed to correcting mistakes and refining its methods. He has set a long-term goal of identifying $1 trillion in government savings, a figure that represents a significant portion of the estimated $7 trillion federal budget for this year.DOGE has already enacted sweeping changes across multiple government agencies, leading to significant job cuts and structural reorganizations. To date, the unit has:Government unions have filed numerous lawsuits challenging these actions, with mixed results. Some courts have temporarily blocked DOGE from accessing sensitive government databases, while others have ruled that unions lack standing to challenge executive orders related to government restructuring.DOGE’s cost-cutting measures have resulted in the shutdown of entire agencies and major restructuring efforts across various federal departments. Some of the most impacted organizations include:While the Trump administration has touted DOGE as a revolutionary effort to eliminate government waste, critics have raised serious concerns regarding its execution and transparency.Despite these challenges, Trump and Musk remain committed to DOGE’s long-term objectives. As the administration moves forward with further government restructuring, the future of the program will likely remain a focal point of political and legal debate in the coming months.","The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was established by President Trump on his first day in office.

Infosys has issued approximately 600 placement offer letters to students from engineering colleges in and around Dharwad district as part of its strategy to ramp up operations at its Hubballi development centre. As reported by Economic Times, the students who have received these offers are expected to join after April this year. This move is part of Infosys' broader plan to hire talented youth from local colleges to scale up its staff strength.The Hubballi development centre, which currently employs over 900 employees and 100 support staff, has seen a three-fold growth in staff numbers over the past year. The centre is expected to continue growing in the coming years. In addition to local hiring, Infosys has implemented a transfer policy offering incentives to employees from other centres who are willing to relocate to Hubballi.Despite these efforts, Infosys has faced criticism for not doing enough to start full-fledged operations at the Hubballi centre. Last year, BJP MLA Arvind Bellad accused the company of ""betrayal at its best"" for not fulfilling its promise of creating a world-class campus and jobs in the Hubli-Dharwad West constituency. Bellad claimed that the 58 acres of land acquired by Infosys were being used to grow plantations instead of developing the promised campus.Bellad also posted a video on microblogging website X (formerly Twitter) where he tagged Infosys.""Betrayal at its finest! @Infosys promised jobs, but all we got were empty #promises and trees. #Infosys #Hubli was granted 58 acres of land which is in my constituency with the aim of fostering employment for the entire North Karnataka region, yet it has failed to deliver on job creation. As a representative, I can't face the farmers I pacified anymore. It's time for Infosys to face the consequences and for the government to reclaim the land that’s rightfully ours,"" he wrote.The issue of the under-staffed Hubballi centre was raised again in the Legislative Council session, with BJP member SV Sankanur and Council chairman Basavaraj Horatti urging Industries Minister MB Patil to intervene and ensure that Infosys starts full-fledged operations. The minister assured that he would soon hold a meeting with the company to address the concerns.Infosys has reiterated its commitment to the Hubballi centre, stating that the location has significant growth potential and is waiting for talented individuals to build its future. The company has also highlighted its hybrid work model, which offers flexibility for employees to work from home or the office, depending on their location.","Infosys has issued approximately 600 placement offer letters to students from engineering colleges in and around Dharwad district.

The court's decision does not completely close the door on Musk 's legal challenge , however, with the judge indicating a willingness to expedite a trial on the core issues potentially as soon as fall 2025.Musk, who originally co-founded OpenAI in 2015, has been vocally critical of the company's shift towards commercialization. In his lawsuit, he accused OpenAI of betraying its original mission of developing artificial intelligence for the public good. The tech entrepreneur has argued that the organization has transformed from a ""tax-exempt charity"" into a ""market-paralyzing"" corporate entity.OpenAI defended its restructuring, asserting that the massive investments required to develop cutting-edge AI technologies necessitate a for-profit model. The company plans to create a public benefit corporation to oversee its commercial operations, which would maintain some of its original nonprofit principles while allowing for more flexible growth.The legal battle reflects the intensifying rivalry between Musk and Altman, two prominent figures in the AI industry. Last month, Musk made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI, which Altman swiftly rejected. The case is expected to continue, with potential full trial proceedings not anticipated until 2027 or 2028 if Musk does not narrow the scope of his lawsuit.","Elon Musk failed to meet legal threshold required for preliminary injunction.

"Sony, Suntory build US stockpiles as Japan faces Trump tariff threat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sony-suntory-build-us-stockpiles-as-japan-faces-trump-tariff-threat/articleshow/118733077.cms,"Japanese electronics giant Sony and drinks maker Suntory are stockpiling inventory in the United States while their peers shift production or supply chains in efforts to fend off an evolving threat of U.S. tariffs on the export-reliant economy.In his latest trade salvo this week, President Donald Trump hinted that he might target Tokyo next, after throwing up new tariff barriers against Mexico and China, low-cost production hubs favoured by key Japanese industries, such as automakers.The scale of the tariff threat for Japan Inc has been further highlighted by Honda's (7267.T), decision to produce a new model of one of its top-selling cars in the United States, instead of Mexico, Reuters exclusively reported on Monday.Japan Display (6740.T), a major supplier of LCD screens to the auto industry, said it was also considering production of some items in the United States, partly to avoid tariffs, a move a recent survey showed is being considered by hundreds of peers.Major Japanese suppliers to iPhone maker Apple - Alps Alpine (6770.T), and Murata Manufacturing (6981.T), are among other firms looking to insulate supply chains from escalating trade tension.""Corporates are now more aware that Japan could also be a target,"" said Norihiro Yamaguchi, a senior economist at Oxford Economics.Yamaguchi pointed to Trump's warning that the United States may use tariffs to offset any competitive disadvantage to its manufacturers if Japan and China do not stop reducing the value of their currencies.The protectionist U.S. president is set to levy reciprocal tariffs globally and industry-specific duties that could further hurt Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, a top exporter to the United States and its biggest source of foreign investment.Japan has denied devaluing its currency and pledged U.S. investments to assuage Trump's concerns on trade. Its trade minister is set to visit Washington as soon as next week to seek tariff exemptions, domestic media have said.Japanese companies are particularly exposed to trade duties as many have concentrated for decades on overseas sales, particularly to the United States, to counter weak domestic demand and a shrinking population, Yamaguchi said.Almost nine in 10 Japanese companies expect Trump's policies to hurt business, a Reuters survey showed last month.Of these, 72% saw his trade strategy, including more tariffs, as the most detrimental factor, while 26% chose friction between the United States and China, Japan's other major trading partner.Even before accounting for tariffs that may target Tokyo, think tank the Daiwa Institute of Research projects that a trade war between the United States and other countries including China could shave 1.4% from Japan's $4.2-trillion economy over two to three years.Stefan Angrick, a senior economist with Moody's Analytics, said it was challenging to quantify the economic damage from tariffs as the business uncertainty they created could be more devastating than any direct impact.More than 300 Japanese companies not yet operating in the United States have indicated they want to set up there, a survey by Japan's export-promotion agency JETRO showed this month, up about 50% from the previous year.""Concerns about future U.S. tariff policies were frequently mentioned in our interviews,"" said Hirotoshi Ito, an official involved in the survey, which did not identify the companies.Other firms had already begun stockpiling products.Sony Group (6758.T), President Hiroki Totoki told a press conference last month that the Playstation maker had been preparing for tariffs by building up inventory from its gaming and electronics divisions in the United States.A company spokesperson declined to provide details.Drinks giant Suntory (2587.T), said it had shipped tequila from its Mexican brands to the United States in anticipation of tariffs of 25% imposed on Mexico and Canada on Tuesday.A spokesperson for the firm said it was also considering shifting sales of Scotch whiskies to Europe from the United States, while focusing on selling more American whiskey in the U.S. to mitigate ""more tariff war and tit-for-tat actions"".Other tariff response strategies have aimed at moving supply chains to try and avoid trade spats.Electronics component maker Alps Alpine said it was advancing a plan to return production to Japan that could help protect its business from tariffs imposed on third-party countries.Alps is a leading maker of smartphone camera actuators, tiny motors that essentially run a camera's focusing system. It supplies Apple from factories in China, Japan and Malaysia, the iPhone maker's latest supplier list shows.The firm said it now makes some items in Mexico for U.S. export that stand to be affected by tariffs.Another Apple supplier, Murata Manufacturing, said it was pushing ahead with efforts to ""double-track"" its supply chain.That involves making items in China for Chinese customers only, and shipping products to the rest of the world from its plants in Japan and Thailand.Specialist talent is in high demand to help companies navigate the minefield of evolving global tariffs.Since Trump's election in November, firms based in Japan have stepped up demand for tax managers and audit professionals, partly to chalk out tariff strategies and compliance, said Grant Torrens, Japan head for recruitment firm Hays .But more broadly among export-focused clients, the uncertainty has also fuelled a trend of lengthier decision-making about new hires.""Organisations are still wanting to pipeline for future hiring, but are cautious to bring in that talent now in case a larger decision is needed on relocating entire production facilities offshore to the United States,"" he added.","U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that he might target Tokyo next.

Elon Musk gives internet users 'Oscar Awards reason' to download Grok app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-gives-internet-users-oscar-awards-reason-to-download-grok-app/articleshow/118732875.cms,"Elon Musk’s Grok3 promises AI with human-like insight

AI’s growing role in predictive analysis

Grok’s Oscar predictions spark debate on AI’s true capabilities

Tech billionaire Elon Musk has once again stirred conversations around artificial intelligence with a bold claim regarding his AI chatbot, Grok. Musk asserts that Grok successfully predicted all the winners at the 2025 Academy Awards, including the most prestigious categories such as Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress. The chatbot reportedly foresaw Anora winning Best Picture, Sean Baker being awarded Best Director, and Mikey Madison securing Best Actress.Musk took to social media to share Grok’s achievement, posting, “Grok successfully predicted all Oscar winners! Download the @Grok app and try voice mode!” The claim has sparked discussions about AI’s predictive capabilities and the extent to which technology can anticipate human decisions.Musk has long been a vocal proponent of AI’s ability to predict outcomes. In a past seminar, he remarked, “Probably the right metric for intelligence is the ability to predict the future.” Now, with Grok’s Oscar predictions, he suggests that this metric has been validated, fueling debates in the AI community and beyond.Grok3, the latest iteration of Musk’s AI chatbot developed under his company xAI, was officially introduced on February 18, 2025. Marketed as a cutting-edge AI model, Grok3 is designed to push the boundaries of computational intelligence and creativity. Unlike its predecessors, this version boasts enhanced natural language processing, deeper contextual understanding, and improved reasoning abilities.Musk has frequently highlighted Grok’s advancements, positioning it as a transformative tool in AI’s evolution. The chatbot is built to process vast amounts of information, learn from human interactions, and deliver responses that mimic human intuition. According to Musk, Grok3 is not only an analytical machine but also an AI capable of grasping context and nuances in ways that set it apart from traditional AI models.The name “Grok” is derived from Robert Heinlein’s classic science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land, where the term means to profoundly understand something. Musk has often referenced this meaning when discussing the chatbot’s objectives. “Empathy is an important part of that,” Musk noted, emphasizing that Grok3 is not just about data processing but also about understanding concepts on a deeper level.Grok’s successful Oscar predictions have reignited discussions on AI’s ability to forecast human decisions. While predictive algorithms have been used in finance, healthcare, and market research, the entertainment industry presents a unique challenge due to its subjective nature. Films and performances are judged by human panels with personal biases, making it difficult for AI to make accurate predictions solely based on data patterns.However, Grok’s accuracy in forecasting Oscar winners has raised questions about whether AI can anticipate cultural trends and human choices with precision. Some experts view this as a breakthrough, suggesting that AI can be trained to analyze historical voting patterns, audience reception, and industry trends to make informed predictions. Others argue that Grok’s success may have been coincidental rather than a testament to AI’s predictive capabilities.AI-driven prediction models are not new. Algorithms have previously been used to predict election results, stock market trends, and even sports outcomes. Yet, Musk’s assertion about Grok’s Oscars success adds a new dimension to AI forecasting, indicating that AI may be able to decode elements of human behavior and decision-making more effectively than previously believed.Despite the enthusiasm surrounding Grok’s performance, skepticism remains. Critics point out that while AI can analyze trends and probabilities, it lacks true human intuition and cultural understanding. Film awards involve factors beyond statistical analysis, such as industry politics, emotional appeal, and unpredictable shifts in sentiment among voters.Additionally, questions have been raised regarding the transparency of Grok’s predictions. Musk has not provided detailed insights into how Grok reached its conclusions. Without a clear methodology, it is difficult to determine whether Grok made accurate predictions based on superior data analysis or if it was merely a lucky guess.AI ethics experts caution against overstating AI’s predictive power, emphasizing that while AI can enhance decision-making, it does not possess human judgment. The discussion surrounding Grok’s predictions also extends into concerns about AI’s potential influence on entertainment, creativity, and media consumption in the future.","Elon Musk claims his AI chatbot, Grok, predicted all the winners at the 2025 Academy Awards.

Elon Musk applauded as Trump highlights energy and efficiency reforms

Role of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)

Democratic opposition and calls for Elon Musk’s removal

Political implications and future prospects

In a significant moment during his first joint address to Congress in his second term, U.S. President Donald Trump publicly praised tech billionaire Elon Musk for his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) and his contributions to national projects. The address, delivered at Capitol Hill on Wednesday, highlighted key policy priorities of the administration, including economic reforms, energy initiatives, and government efficiency measures. While Musk’s involvement in government administration has been met with strong Republican support, it has also sparked controversy among Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have raised concerns over his role.During his speech, President Trump acknowledged Musk’s efforts and contributions, stating, “Thank you, Elon, you are working very hard. Everyone appreciates it, even this side,” referencing Democratic members of Congress. The comment was met with mixed reactions from the audience, with Republican lawmakers applauding the acknowledgment, while many Democrats remained silent or appeared skeptical.Trump's praise for Musk was tied directly to his administration’s efforts to streamline government operations and reduce inefficiencies, a role delegated to the DOGE. The president described Musk as a key figure in these initiatives, reinforcing his commitment to reducing government waste and cutting costs. The president further emphasized Musk’s leadership in major economic projects, particularly in the energy sector.A central highlight of Trump’s address was the administration’s focus on energy independence and infrastructure development. He announced progress on a ""gigantic gas pipeline in Alaska,"" a project that has drawn interest from international partners such as Japan and South Korea. The initiative aims to enhance U.S. energy exports, create jobs, and reduce energy costs for American consumers. Trump asserted that reducing energy costs would play a crucial role in combating inflation, a major economic challenge facing his administration.The president also reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to reducing government expenditure and increasing efficiency. This initiative aligns with the objectives of DOGE, which was established to oversee cost-cutting measures, optimize federal agencies, and eliminate unnecessary government spending.The creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Musk’s leadership has been one of the most controversial decisions of Trump’s second term. Established to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, DOGE has been tasked with streamlining government operations, cutting red tape, and implementing technological advancements to improve administrative efficiency.Musk’s appointment as the head of DOGE was seen as an unconventional choice, given his background as a tech entrepreneur rather than a government administrator. His companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink, have a strong focus on innovation, and Trump’s administration has positioned DOGE as a government entity that can incorporate private-sector efficiency into public administration.Despite Trump’s praise, Musk’s leadership of DOGE has been a contentious issue among Democratic lawmakers. On Monday, over three dozen Democratic legislators called for Musk’s removal, citing concerns over his conflicts of interest and alleging that the administration had unlawfully dismissed numerous government officials whose agencies were investigating or prosecuting Musk’s companies.Critics argue that Musk’s leadership in a government agency overseeing efficiency measures could lead to conflicts with his private business interests, particularly in sectors such as energy, space exploration, and transportation. Additionally, they claim that the dismissal of key officials from regulatory agencies under DOGE’s jurisdiction raises questions about transparency and accountability.Trump’s strong endorsement of Musk reflects his administration’s broader strategy of integrating private-sector expertise into public governance. The move aligns with Trump’s long-standing emphasis on deregulation, economic growth, and minimizing government intervention in business. However, the controversy surrounding Musk’s leadership underscores the deep partisan divide on the issue.Looking ahead, the administration’s focus on reshaping federal governance, targeting illegal immigration, and revising diplomatic strategies with international allies will remain key areas of discussion. Meanwhile, the ongoing debate over Musk’s role in government is likely to continue, with potential legal and political ramifications in the months to come.","President Donald Trump publicly praised tech billionaire Elon Musk for his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) during his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday.

Why and how Elon Musk's federal budget squeeze does not mean 'bad news' for Indian IT companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-and-how-elon-musks-federal-budget-squeeze-does-not-mean-bad-news-for-indian-it-companies/articleshow/118730644.cms,"DOGE chief and Tesla CEO Elon Musk

The recent federal budget cuts led by Elon Musk , head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have raised concerns about their impact on various sectors. However, industry experts suggest that Indian IT companies are likely to remain largely unaffected by these changes.The DOGE's move to cancel some federal contracts could hit consulting-focused technology companies hired by the US government for discretionary projects. However, the Indian IT services industry receives an insignificant portion of the annual US federal spending , accounting for less than 2% of its annual revenue. This suggests that the exposure of the over $280 billion Indian IT industry to US federal contracts is under $6 billion.Most analysts agree that DOGE's primary authority is limited to federal contracts, whereas a majority of government contracts awarded to Indian IT firms are with state and local governments. This largely insulates them from DOGE's decisions. Data from HFS Research indicates that the US federal government spends an estimated $60 billion a year on consulting fees2. While companies like Wipro and Cognizant have strong consulting businesses, their exposure to US federal contracts remains limited.For 2025, the US federal budget has proposed spending $75 billion on IT at civilian agencies to help deliver simple, seamless, and secure government services. The President’s budget includes an additional $75 million for the technology modernization fund, an innovative funding model that reimagines how the government uses IT.Despite short-term uncertainties, Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, believes DOGE’s initiatives are likely to bring about a renaissance in federal government technology spending for global technology players. Indian-heritage IT services players that have built a strong public services business would benefit, as would firms that have invested in local talent and development centers in the US through organic and inorganic means.In conclusion, while the federal budget squeeze may impact some consulting-focused technology companies, Indian IT firms are expected to face minimal impact due to their limited exposure to US federal contracts.","The recent federal budget cuts led by Elon Musk have raised concerns about their impact on various sectors.

"How Jim Walker, the man who saw the 2008 stock market crash coming, may have just 'agreed' with Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'stock market Gyaan'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-jim-walker-the-man-who-saw-the-2008-stock-market-crash-coming-may-have-just-agreed-with-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamaths-stock-market-gyaan/articleshow/118727832.cms,"Jim Walker to investors: Take long-term investment approach

Jim Walker picks India over China

Indian stock markets witnessed Bears carnage in the month of February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower. The carnage witnessed in the market during the month led to a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalization of BSE-listed companies and Nifty 50 marked its longest losing streak since its inception in 1996. The relentless downward trend has left retail investors anxious. In a message to investors Zerodha Founder and CEO Nithin Kamath termed the fall as ""the first real market correction "" since Covid pandemic.""Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable,"" he said. Kamath told investors to not get carried away by the doom and gloom in the market and continue investing in SIPs. ""I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles,"" he said.A similar sentiment comes from Jim Walker, a celebrated economist from Alethia Capital who famously foresaw the 2008 financial crisis. In an exclusive interaction with ETNow, Walker gave perspective on the current state of the global economy and what he thinks about India. Contrary to widespread concerns that today’s market exuberance might precipitate a collapse akin to that of 2008, Walker holds a different view.Speaking with ETNow, he acknowledged a global economic slowdown but stressed that the circumstances differ markedly from those preceding the financial debacle over ten years ago. Similar to Nithin Kamath, Walker batted for a long-term investment approach. Walker encouraged his clients to boost their stakes in India, despite valuation concerns in its stock market. “I’ve advised clients this week to significantly increase their investments in India. Though stock valuations raise eyebrows, I believe economic growth will soon justify them with strong corporate earnings,” he elaborated.Known for his prescient 2006-07 warning of a looming U.S. housing market crash, Walker remarked that today’s danger signals are less evident. “The signs were glaring in 2006-07 when we predicted a severe downturn driven by excesses in the property sector; it’s not the same now,” he said.He pointed out that unlike the lead-up to 2008, there are currently no significant overindulgences in the housing or financial sectors poised to spark a major banking crisis. Although certain areas show excessive stock market gains and asset price inflation, Walker believes these won’t lead to widespread corporate failures that could rattle the banking system. “We’re not seeing the kind of corporate collapses that impacted banks in 2008. That’s not on the horizon,” he observed.Additionally, Walker expressed a stronger preference for investing in India over China, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to increase investments there. He is especially sanguine about India’s prospects, citing its robust policy environment—the best in three decades—as a key factor enhancing its appeal to investors. “India’s policy stability and certainty are at their peak in the last 30 years,” he asserted, crediting solid monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate stability for bolstering India’s economic structure.He also praised the Indian government’s efforts in deregulation and improving business conditions, which he views as catalysts for future growth. By supporting small and medium enterprises, Walker believes India will spur further economic and job growth.","Jim Walker picks India over China as an opportune moment to increase investments there.

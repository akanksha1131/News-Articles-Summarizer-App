What Tesla shareholders said about the company’s Robotaxi service



iOS 26 Public Beta Is Here: Apple’s Biggest Redesign Since iOS 7

Elon Musk and Tesla are facing a lawsuit from the shareholders of the electric vehicle-making company. In the lawsuit, shareholders accused the EV maker and its CEO of securities fraud, alleging that the company concealed significant safety risks associated with its self-driving vehicles, including the Robotaxi . According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the proposed class action lawsuit was filed in the federal court of Austin, Texas. It follows Tesla's first public test of its robotaxis in late June, which reportedly showed the vehicles speeding, braking abruptly, driving over curbs, entering incorrect lanes, and dropping off passengers in the middle of multi-lane roads.As per the Reuters report, Tesla shareholders have alleged that the company exaggerated the capabilities of its autonomous driving technology, thereby overstating its business outlook and inflating its stock value. However, the company's stock declined by 6.1% across two consecutive trading sessions following the start of the test. The lawsuit aims to recover unspecified damages for investors who held shares between April 19, 2023, and June 22, 2025, Reuters added.The lawsuit comes after Musk teased the launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in San Francisco last week. The service’s expected expansion will follow a limited pilot in Austin, Texas, where a small fleet of vehicles started operating within a geofenced area.In San Francisco, the initial operational zone is expected to cover the broader Bay Area. Select Tesla owners have received early invitations, and the launch has reportedly also been moved up.Expansion plans for this service even include states like Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, but broader deployment depends on obtaining regulatory approvals. In California, Tesla has yet to complete the permit process required for full driverless services, with state agencies emphasising safety evaluations.The service is said to be introduced on an invite-only basis that will allow Tesla to manage safety, collect data, and meet compliance standards. This phased approach reflects the company’s cautious strategy amid regulatory and technical challenges.","Elon Musk and Tesla are facing a lawsuit from the shareholders of the electric vehicle-making company.

Trump’s recent policy shifts show selective approach

US President Donald Trump announced that new tariffs on semiconductor and chip imports will be unveiled ""within the next week or so,"" as his administration pursues an aggressive trade policy aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the United States.""We're going to be announcing on semiconductors and chips, which is a separate category, because we want them made in the United States,"" Trump said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" The president, however, did not provide specific details about tariff rates or implementation timelines.The announcement comes as the Commerce Department has been investigating the semiconductor market since April to lay the groundwork for possible tariffs on an industry expected to generate nearly $700 billion in global sales, according to Bloomberg.The vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors currently come from Taiwan, home to major chipmaker TSMC, whose customers include tech giants Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm and AMD.The semiconductor tariff announcement follows Trump's recent decision in April to exclude smartphones, computers, and other electronics from higher tariffs, though other existing duties remain in place. US Customs and Border Protection updated its guidance to exempt various tech products from the 125% additional tariff on Chinese goods and the base 10% global tariff.Despite Trump's claims that ""people love the tariffs,"" his approval rating has declined in multiple poll trackers' latest updates, per CNBC. Historical data, as quoted in the CNBC report, shows that the president's first-term trade war with China actually expanded China's trade surplus with the US between 2018 and 2021, according to industry reports.Trump had sharply criticized the Biden administration's $52 billion CHIPS Act subsidies as ""ridiculous,"" arguing that tariff threats provide superior incentives for domestic manufacturing. ""We will have more plants built in the next short period of time than ever before because the incentive will be there,"" Trump stated at a House GOP conference earlier this year in January, though he provided no specific timelines for these projected developments.","US President Donald Trump announced that new tariffs on semiconductor and chip imports will be unveiled ""within the next week or so"" The announcement comes as the Commerce Department has been investigating the semiconductor market since April.

How Intel may be struggling with its 18A manufacturing process



“Hail Mary”

""risk production""

""Panther Lake""

iOS 26 Public Beta Is Here: Apple’s Biggest Redesign Since iOS 7

Intel’s key manufacturing process, 18A, is reportedly facing significant quality issues as the company tests newer technologies. This issue threatens Intel's timeline for manufacturing deals and its effort to regain a competitive edge in producing high-end chips. A report by the news agency Reuters cited two people who were briefed on the matter to claim that Intel has spent billions on developing the 18A process, including building and upgrading several factories. The US-based chip maker’s goal was to challenge Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), a key supplier that helps Intel produce some of its chips. One of the sources also compared Intel’s effort to a ""Hail Mary” football pass, describing the company’s aggressive timeline to roll out unproven systems to reduce its contract foundry business dependency on closing the technology gap with TSMC.Intel undertook the 18A manufacturing process challenge to narrow its performance gap with TSMC. Still, the company’s fast-paced rollout of untested systems created significant hurdles, two individuals familiar with its test data said to Reuters. One described the initiative as afootball pass.In April, Intel announced it had startedfor Panther Lake chips using the 18A process. At the Taiwan Computex expo in May, it showcased several laptops that it said were powered by these chips.Initial testing of Intel’s 18A process reportedly fell short of customer expectations last year. However, the company has maintained that the technology remains on schedule for high-volume production of itslaptop chips in 2025.These chips feature next-generation transistors and an updated power delivery method. Intel has positioned this development as a key step toward attracting more external clients to its foundry business, which new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been reassessing, according to Reuters.Two individuals familiar with internal test data since late last year said to Reuters that only a limited portion of Panther Lake chips produced using the 18A process have met quality standards for customer use.Progress in chip manufacturing is often measured by defect density, which depends on the chip’s design. Compared to industry norms, Panther Lake chips showed approximately three times the acceptable number of defects for large-scale production, the two individuals said.Production success rate also referred to as ""yield"" is also an essential factor in determining whether Intel can manufacture the chips cost-effectively. Yield can fluctuate as manufacturing processes are refined, and companies often measure it differently, making it a variable metric, according to two sources and two others familiar with Intel’s operations, Reuters reported.By late last year, around 5% of the Panther Lake chips produced met Intel’s standards, according to the sources. That yield increased to about 10% by this summer, one source noted, adding that Intel might report a higher figure if it includes chips that do not meet all performance benchmarks.","Intel’s key manufacturing process, 18A, is reportedly facing significant quality issues.

What Cognition's CEO Scott Wu said to the company’s employees



“We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two. We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition, where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks,”

iOS 26 Public Beta Is Here: Apple’s Biggest Redesign Since iOS 7

Artificial intelligence startup Cognition is offering voluntary buyouts to its roughly 200 new employees just weeks after acquiring the developer tools company Windsurf . The company is providing a severance package equivalent to nine months' salary for those who decide to leave. This move signals an effort to quickly integrate Windsurf’s technology and clients while retaining employees who align with Cognition's culture. The buyout addresses a difference in work-life expectations between the two companies. Cognition's CEO, Scott Wu, has made it clear to the incoming staff of the newly acquired company that they must meet a specific standard to continue working in Cognition.In an internal memo obtained by The Information (seen by Winbuzzer), Wu highlighted the company’s high expectations and expressed an unapologetic view on the importance of a strong work ethic.Wu said.He described the move as fair, stating that the company does not support imposing cultural expectations on those who did not initially agree to them.Wu explained that the intent was to allow a respectful and transparent exit for employees who may not be comfortable with the level of commitment now expected. The company recognises that not all team members may want to continue after the acquisition and is offering a structured option for those who wish to depart.The offer, which is open to around 200 employees with a decision deadline of August 10, follows recent layoffs involving roughly 30 Windsurf staff. Taken together, the layoffs and the voluntary exit plan suggest a deliberate approach aimed at forming a more streamlined, closely aligned team focused on Cognition’s evolving goals.The acquisition comes after Windsurf's recent developments mark the conclusion of a series of corporate changes. A proposed $3 billion acquisition by OpenAI fell through after Microsoft, OpenAI’s major investor and partner, raised concerns over its intellectual property terms.Following this, Google hired Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and other team members for its DeepMind division, and also licensed Windsurf’s technology. A few days later, Cognition announced its acquisition of the remaining parts of the company, initiating a shift in its organisational culture.",Artificial intelligence startup Cognition is offering voluntary buyouts to its roughly 200 new employees.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Meta tried to buy OpenAI ’s former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati startup, Thinking Machines Lab . But as she declined to sell her company despite a $1 billion offer, CEO Mark Zuckerberg “responded by launching a full-scale raid,” reports the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Zuckerberg, the report says, approached more than a dozen of Thinking Machines’ 50 employees in the following weeks “to sound them out about jumping ship”. According to the publication, one of his main targets was Andrew Tulloch , a leading researcher and co-founder of the startup.In order to lure Tulloch, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg offered a pay package that could reach $1.5 billion over six years, depending on bonuses and Meta’s stock performance. However, Tulloch also turned down the offer.Meta has been trying to recruit employees from OpenAI and startups founded by its former employees, like Murati’s Thinking Machines and Dario Amodei’s Anthropic. Meta has reached out to more than 100 OpenAI employees and hired at least 10.The report quotes Meta spokesperson Andy Stone who called the offer “inaccurate and ridiculous.” He said that compensation packages depend on stock price performance and added that Meta is not trying to buy Thinking Machines.Andrew Tulloch started his academic journey at the University of Sydney. He graduated with first-class honours and received a University Medal in mathematics. Tulloch then completed a Master’s degree in Mathematical Statistics at Cambridge and pursued a PhD at UC Berkeley.As per his LinkedIn profile, Tulloch worked at Meta from 2012 to 2023. He was involved in building machine learning systems and helped develop PyTorch, a tool that became widely used in AI research and development. His work had a major influence on Meta’s AI infrastructure. Meta’s Alexandr Wang, who now leads its superintelligence lab, also tried to persuade Tulloch to join Meta.In 2016, OpenAI’s Greg Brockman had tried to hire Tulloch but could not match his Facebook salary. Tulloch eventually joined OpenAI seven years later in 2023 when ChatGPT had already become widely popular. At OpenAI, he worked on GPT-4’s pretraining and reasoning models. In early 2025, he co-founded Thinking Machines Lab.","Mark Zuckerberg offered $1.5 billion pay package to Andrew Tulloch, co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab.

Taiwan government have detained three current and former employees of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to the world's most advanced chip technology. TSMC fired several employees after discovering the breach through routine internal monitoring, then initiated legal proceedings that led to the arrests. The case marks the first major prosecution under Taiwan's amended National Security Act, with suspects facing up to 12 years in prison and fines exceeding $3 million.The company, which produces 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors for companies like Apple and Nvidia, detected unauthorized access to sensitive information about its cutting-edge 2-nanometer chip technology , expected to enter mass production later this year.The case involves proprietary information about TSMC's 2-nanometer manufacturing process, currently the most sophisticated chip technology globally. Taiwan's High Prosecutors Office confirmed that three suspects were detained on ""serious suspicions of violating national security laws,"" while three others were released on bail.Prosecutors revealed the investigation began when TSMC detected unusual file access patterns by current employees. Internal investigations uncovered that former employees had allegedly colluded with current staff to obtain ""national core technology trade secrets."" The breach occurred at TSMC's Hsinchu facility, where the company produces its most advanced chips.Taiwan amended its National Security Act in 2022 specifically to protect critical technologies from foreign adversaries, particularly targeting semiconductor innovations more advanced than 14-nanometer processes. The legislation addresses growing concerns about Chinese companies obtaining chip manufacturing expertise by recruiting Taiwanese engineers.Under the enhanced law, violations involving national core technologies carry severe penalties: imprisonment up to 12 years and fines reaching NT$100 million ($3.3 million). The comprehensive framework protects defense, aerospace, agricultural, semiconductor, and information security technologies deemed vital to Taiwan's national interests.TSMC emphasized its ""zero-tolerance policy toward any actions that compromise the protection of trade secrets,"" stating it will pursue violations ""to the fullest extent of the law."" The company has previously fought extended legal battles against competitors who obtained its technology through former employees, including cases involving Samsung and China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.The investigation continues as prosecutors work to determine the suspects' motives and whether any sensitive information was actually transmitted to competitors or foreign entities.","Taiwan government detains three current and former employees of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for allegedly stealing trade secrets.

What Foxconn says on Ohio factory sale

iOS 26 Public Beta Is Here: Apple’s Biggest Redesign Since iOS 7

Foxconn has sold the former General Motors (GM) factory in Ohio which it acquired three years ago, via TechCrunch. The plant, which was supposed to become a key electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing site, has failed to manufacture any major EV. In a regulatory filing with the Taiwan Stock exchange, Foxconn announced that it sold the factory and surrounding land for about $88 million. It also sold machinery and equipment from its EV businesses for $287 million. The buyer is named Crescent Dune LLC, a business created in Delaware just 12 days before the sale. Foxconn did not provide more details about the buyer.Foxconn bought the factory in 2021 for $230 million when it was owned by EV startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said the plant would be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.”Notably, this is Foxconn's second high-profile failure to deliver on US manufacturing promises. Earlier, the company had pledged to build a large LCD factory in Wisconsin, which President Trump had called the “eighth wonder of the world.” But the project failed to meet expectations.Foxconn's plans to build EVs at the factory faced several setbacks.

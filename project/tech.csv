Market capitalisation: Boosting Tesla’s market capitalisation from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion.

Robotaxi fleet: Putting 1 million robotaxis into service.

Vehicle sales: Selling 12 million more cars.

FSD subscriptions: Achieving 10 million Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscriptions.

Humanoid robots: Producing 1 million humanoid robots.





Tesla shareholders voted to approve CEO Elon Musk's compensation plan potentially worth nearly $1 trillion, with 75% voting in favour. The company's board recommended approval of the pay package, which was introduced in September. Tesla announced the results of the vote on Thursday (November 6) at its annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas. The final vote tally is expected to be formalized in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing within days. Musk is expected to achive certain milestones, like selling robotaxi fleet, humanoid robots and more to get the full package.The approval essentially grants Musk enormous influence over the electric vehicle (EV) company and aims to mitigate the risk of him focusing his attention on other ventures.

The package is worth twice the GDP of Bangladesh, a country with 174 million people.Only 20 countries recorded a 2024 GDP larger than Musk's compensation deal, based on World Bank figures. It is more than Belgium ($664.6 billion), Argentina ($633.3 billion), Sweden ($610.1 billion), Ireland ($577.4 billion) and Singapore ($547.4 billion).However, the compensation package for Musk, currently the world's richest person, consists of 12 separate stock grants. Musk would receive these shares if Tesla achieves specific performance targets over the next 10 years. These requirements include:Tesla's board had argued that failing to approve the massive payout risked losing Musk to other interests, positioning the deal as essential for securing the CEO's commitment to Tesla's future as a leader in AI and robotics.The shareholder vote proceeded despite significant opposition from major investors, including Norges Bank Investment Management (which manages Norway’s sovereign wealth fund). Major proxy advisory firms also opposed the plan.","Tesla shareholders voted to approve CEO Elon Musk's compensation plan potentially worth nearly $1 trillion.

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

What the US Senators said about the new AI law





“Artificial intelligence is already replacing American workers, and experts project AI could drive unemployment up to 10-20% in the next five years. The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around.”

“Good policy starts with good data. This bipartisan legislation will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce – what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging. Armed with this information, we can make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind,”





US Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) have proposed a new law requiring companies to report job cuts linked to artificial intelligence (AI). This legislation which was brought to the Senate this week, would mandate major American companies and federal agencies to report AI-related employment data to the US Department of Labor (DOL), which would then make the information public. In a blog post, Hawley wrote that thewouldwhich will thenThe bill, referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, currently requires only publicly traded companies to report the data to DOL. However, it also includes a provision directing officials to determine how privately held companies could be brought under the same reporting rules, suggesting they may eventually be subject to similar requirements.Commenting on the proposed AI legislation, Hawley said:Warner added.According to a report by Axios, Hawley and Warner referenced Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s warning that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and raise unemployment to 10–20% within five years, along with other forecasts about AI’s impact on the workplace, as motivation for their proposed bill.The bipartisan legislation reflects growing concern in Congress about AI's impact on American jobs, even as the Trump administration promotes the technology as essential to maintaining US economic competitiveness.As AI and automation drive significant job cuts, layoffs have surged in 2025, especially in warehousing and technology. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, US employers cut 153,074 jobs in October, which is a 175% year-over-year and 183% month-on-month increase. The analysts said this was the highest October total in more than two decades, linking the trend to disruptive technologies like AI.Meanwhile, Revealera hiring trends researcher Henley Wing Chiu reported an 8% decline in global job postings, with creative roles such as computer graphics, photography, and writing down over 28%. At the same time, demand for machine learning engineers continued to rise.Apart from this, Warner and Hawley have recently introduced another bill to ban AI chatbots for children. These lawmakers are seeking more data on how AI is affecting employment as companies increasingly cite the technology as a factor behind widespread job cuts.",US Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) have proposed a new law requiring companies to report job cuts linked to artificial intelligence (AI) This legislation would mandate major American companies and federal agencies to report AI-related employment data to the US Department of Labor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125143622,imgsize-1677097,width-400,resizemode-4/new-bill-presented-in-senate-would-require-american-companies-to-report-ai-layoffs.jpg"

Microsoft Superintelligence Team says its goals are 'different'





Microsoft is forming a team that will be tasked with performing advanced artificial intelligence research. Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the Microsoft AI group that includes Bing and the Copilot assistant, announced the formation of the MAI Superintelligence Team. Suleyman said that that he will be leading it. Called the MAI Superintelligence Team, the project follows similar efforts as by Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta Platforms, Safe Superintelligence Inc and others that have begun targeting technical leaps. In fact, Facebook parent Meta has been spending billions to hire talent for its new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit that’s working on research and products. Meta this year offered $100 million signing bonuses to recruit AI engineers, leading the AI talent war.The term superintelligence typically refers to machines deemed more intelligent than the smartest people.Microsoft's effort comes with a twist. According to Suleyman, the company is not chasing ""infinitely capable generalist"" AI like some peers. The reason, he said, is he doubts that autonomous, self-improving machines could be controlled, despite research into how humanity might keep AI in check. Suleyman said he aims to focus the Microsoft team on specialist models that achieve what he called superhuman performance while posing ""virtually no existential risk whatsoever.“We are doing this to solve real concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable,” Suleyman wrote. “We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity.” He said Microsoft has a vision for ""humanist superintelligence,"" or technology that could solve defined problems with a real-world benefit.""Humanism requires us to always ask the question: does this technology serve human interests?"" said Suleyman.He said the effort is based on AI that reasons through problems and still would require breakthroughs. But if achieved, he said the AI would ""increase our life expectancy and give everybody more healthy years, because we'll be able to detect preventable diseases much earlier.""","Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the Microsoft AI group that includes Bing and the Copilot assistant, announced the formation of the MAI Superintelligence Team.

“Even setting the deception aside, Spotify’s business model has made true personalisation impossible.”

What Spotify said about the lawsuit



“nonsense.”

“Discovery Mode is a feature artists can use to flag priority tracks for algorithmic consideration in limited contexts: Radio, Autoplay, and certain Mixes. It doesn’t buy plays, it doesn’t affect editorial playlists, and it’s clearly disclosed in the app and on our website.”

“basic facts,”





Spotify is facing a new class action lawsuit. Filed in the New York federal court, the lawsuit alleges that the Swedish music streaming company uses asystem that dictates music recommendations and playlist placement. The suit claims this system favours major-label tracks, causing problems for users who expect recommendations based on their listening history. The issue came to light when a Spotify user, Genevieve Capolongo, noted that despite her interest in lesser-known indie artists, the platform repeatedly recommended mainstream tracks from artists like Drake , Zach Bryan, and Justin Bieber According to a report by The Hollywood Reporter, the lawsuit alleges that Spotify engaged in deceptive practices and false advertising, among other claims. It seeks unspecified damages and a court order to block Spotify from using paid arrangements to influence playlist and recommendation placements. This lawsuit also requests that Spotify be required to disclose when promotions influence songs on the platform.Spotify has become an important platform for music discovery through two kinds of playlists: editorial, curated by staff, and algorithmic, generated by its recommendation system.Both influence what listeners hear, as being featured on major playlists such as Rap Caviar or Today’s Top Hits can significantly increase an artist’s visibility and earnings.According to the lawsuit, placement on playlists can cost between $2,000 and $10,000, with some payments labelled asThe complaint says independent artists are at a disadvantage because major labels, through licensing agreements, gain better access to these playlists and receive preferential treatment in recommendations.The lawsuit also targets Spotify’s Discovery Mode, which was introduced by the company in 2020. This feature allows artists to promote songs on algorithmic playlists in exchange for reduced royalty payments rather than direct fees.Critics have compared this to the pay-for-play schemes that once affected the radio industry. Drake referenced this feature in a lawsuit against UMG, criticising lower royalties for greater exposure.The House Judiciary Committee has also expressed concern that Discovery Mode couldpushing artists to accept lower payouts to remain visible in a competitive environment.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124805693,imgsize-7992,width-400,resizemode-4/x-twitter.jpg"

How the free tier of Xbox Cloud Gaming may work

Eligible Free Play Days titles (games typically offered for a free weekend trial).

Xbox Retro Classics games.

Xbox’s higher sales targets







Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

‘DON’T YOU DARE!’: China THUNDERS As Trump Threatens To Go ‘Guns-A-Blazing’ Into Nigeria

Norwegian test confirmed security risk









Authorities in Denmark are reportedly investigating a ‘dangerous’ security vulnerability in hundreds of Chinese-made electric buses that potentially allows them to be remotely deactivated. The investigation has been prompted by findings from Norway, where transport officials discovered that the Chinese supplier, Yutong, maintains remote access to the vehicles’ control systems for diagnostics and software updates. This access, authorities fear, may be exploited to disrupt buses while they are in transit.Movia, the country’s largest public transport company, operates 469 Chinese electric buses, with 262 manufactured by Yutong, a report by The Guardian said. Jeppe Gaard, Movia’s chief operating officer, acknowledged that he was recently informed that “electric buses – like electric cars – can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have web access.”Gaard added that the problem is not specific to Chinese buses but affects “all types of vehicles and devices with Chinese electronics built in.”The Danish agency for civil protection and emergency management, Samsik, confirmed it has been contacted by Movia.Samsik warned that the vehicles are equipped with subsystems with internet connectivity and sensors – including cameras, microphones, and GPS—that “can constitute vulnerabilities which could be exploited to disrupt bus operations.”The initial alarm was raised by Ruter, Norway’s public transport authority. Amid growing concerns over potential security flaws, Ruter tested two electric buses from Yutong in an isolated environment. Bernt Reitan Jenssen, Ruter’s chief executive, stated that the testing “revealed risks that we are now taking measures against,” and noted that national and local authorities have been informed.While investigators found that removing the buses' SIM cards could prevent remote deactivation, they opted against this action as it would also disconnect the vehicles from essential operating systems.In response to the security concerns, a spokesperson for Yutong stated that the company ""strictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards"" of the locations where its vehicles operate.Yutong also says that its vehicle data in the EU is stored at an Amazon Web Services (AWS) datacentre in Frankfurt and is used solely for maintenance and optimisation.","Authorities in Denmark are reportedly investigating a ‘dangerous’ security vulnerability in hundreds of Chinese-made electric buses.

US software company SAS Institute has withdrawn from the Chinese market. With this move, the company has ended more than two decades of operations amid domestic competition and geopolitical tensions. According to a South China Morning Post (SCMP) report, the analytics specialist also eliminated approximately 400 jobs on the mainland, an affected employee said. The company reportedly announced the layoffs via email and a short video call, during which executives citedas the reason for the exits. Each affected employee was asked to sign a separation agreement by November 14.The compensation package offered includes one month's pay for each year of service, two additional months of salary, an annual bonus, and pay through the end of this year. The report cited an affected employee who claimed that SAS is expected to issue a public statement next week.

The SAS Software (Beijing) Co., Guangzhou Branch, ended its office lease two months ago.

This came after US chipmaker Micron Technology announced further layoffs as part of its global restructuring following weak demand in the mobile NAND memory market.Earlier this year, IBM shut down one of its major local entities, IBM (China) Investment Co., ending 32 years of operations.

Wales's intervention – accusing the article of taking sides in a major controversy – is in line with the long-standing criticism from Elon Musk , who have often claimed the platform has a political bias.In an update posted to the article’s discussion page (via The National), Wales called the page a “particularly egregious” example of a neutrality issue. His primary concern centred on the article's lead paragraph, which currently states, in Wikipedia’s own voice: “The Gaza genocide is the ongoing, intentional, and systematic destruction of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip carried out by Israel during the Gaza war. ”Wales argued that this phrasing is a clear violation of Wikipedia’s core policy requiring neutrality and attribution for contested claims.“At present, the lede and the overall presentation state, in Wikipedia’s voice, that Israel is committing genocide, although that claim is highly contested,” Wales wrote, adding, “This policy is non-negotiable, and the principles upon which it is based cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, nor by editor consensus.”He revealed that he had been asked about the article in a ""high profile"" media interview and had responded that it ""fails to meet our high standards and needs immediate attention.""This comes as popular figures, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, have publicly criticised Wikipedia, alleging a significant left-wing and ideological bias. Last year, Musk said that the platform is “controlled by far-left activists” and called on the public to stop donating.“Wikipedia is controlled by far-left activists. People should stop donating to them,"" Musk said. In 2023, he intensified his attacks, offering $1 billion to rename the site ""Dickipedia"" and accusing it of having a “non-trivial left-wing bias.”Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales responded to Musk's remarks with apparent indifference: “I mean, he's had a war of words with me; I just ignore him. So I didn't really respond to that.”","Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has publicly intervened in a heated editorial dispute over an article on the “Gaza genocide” Wales claims the article violates the free online encyclopedia's fundamental principle of neutrality.

Engineers’ biggest 'headache' is now Collins Dictionary’s Word of the Year 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/engineers-biggest-headache-is-now-collins-dictionarys-word-of-the-year-2025/articleshow/125135909.cms,"The numbers tell a startling story about AI's takeover





The term that sent shivers down programmers' spines just months ago has become Collins Dictionary's word of the year for 2025: ""vibe coding."" It describes something once unthinkable—building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy coined the phrase in February, urging developers to ""give in to the vibes"" and ""forget the code even exists."" Collins picked it after usage exploded across tech circles and beyond.Anyone can now spin up basic software by telling AI what they want: ""Build me a meal planner"" or ""Create a fitness tracker."" Even Google's CEO Sundar Pichai is dabbling, using tools like Cursor and Replit to build a custom news aggregator. ""It feels so delightful to be a coder in this moment,"" he told Bloomberg Tech in June, his enthusiasm barely contained.The shift is rewriting Silicon Valley's rules. Y Combinator chief Garry Tan puts it bluntly: 10 vibe coders can now match the output of 100 traditional engineers. His accelerator's numbers back it up—a quarter of current startups let AI write 95% of their code. Where founders once needed armies of engineers and mountains of venture capital, they're now launching with lean teams and AI doing the heavy lifting.""That's such a powerful moment in software,"" Tan told CNBC.But here's where it gets serious. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella dropped a bombshell in April: AI now writes up to 30% of the company's code, and that figure keeps climbing. At Google, Pichai revealed in October that more than a quarter of new code springs from AI, not human fingers on keyboards. These aren't experimental side projects—this is production code running services used by billions.Meta's Mark Zuckerberg is betting even bigger. He predicts half of his company's development will be AI-driven within a year, with the company building AI models specifically designed to develop other AI models. The tech giants aren't just using AI as a helper—they're fundamentally rewiring how software gets made.Not everyone's celebrating. OpenAI's Sam Altman warned in March that demand for software engineers could eventually dip as AI handles more grunt work. Each developer will simply ""do much, much more for a while,"" he said, before adding the stark reality: ""And then at some point, yeah, maybe we do need less software engineers.""The shift is already visible in corporate cuts. Companies from Amazon to Salesforce have cited AI when slashing thousands of jobs. Still, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argues AI is the ""great equalizer,"" turning natural language into a new programming tool. ""There's a new programming language,"" he told London Tech Week. ""It's called 'human.'""""Vibe coding"" beat out other tech-flavored contenders including ""clanker""—slang for frustrating AI bots—""broligarchy"" for tech billionaires wielding political power, and ""aura farming"" for performing coolness on camera.Collins' Alex Beecroft called it a snapshot of ""how language is evolving alongside technology,"" marking the moment when talking to machines became as natural as typing commands.","""Vibe coding"" is Collins Dictionary's word of the year for 2025.

Leaked 2020 email from Palantir co-founder to Zuckerberg predicted Mamdani’s socialist triumph in New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/leaked-2020-email-from-palantir-co-founder-to-zuckerberg-predicted-mamdanis-socialist-triumph-in-new-york/articleshow/125135573.cms,"The viral email from 2020 predicting socialism

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

Tech elites were the audience, but the message reached the streets

Mamdani’s rise as proof of a new political economy

Expanding social housing

Capping corporate landlord influence

Debt relief for low-income residents

Redirecting municipal funding to public services





New York’s political landscape shifted dramatically with Zohran Mamdani ’s election as the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, an openly socialist candidate who ran on housing affordability, debt relief and public ownership. But four years before this moment, a warning circulated quietly among Silicon Valley’s most powerful figures. In a late-night email sent in January 2020, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel cautioned Mark Zuckerberg , Nick Clegg and Marc Andreessen that rising millennial support for socialism was not cultural rebellion, but a predictable response to economic reality. The message resurfaced this week after being shared by investor Chamath Palihapitiya, sparking debate over whether the tech elite saw this shift coming and failed to act.In the email, Peter Thiel argued that dismissing young voters as entitled or brainwashed was both incorrect and strategically dangerous. Referencing data that nearly 70 percent of millennials identified as pro-socialist, he urged his peers to understand the material causes driving the sentiment. The issue, he wrote, was not ideology but arithmetic.“When one has too much student debt or if housing is too unaffordable, then one will have negative capital for a long time and find it hard to start accumulating real estate.And if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it.”This idea, that debt and housing lock an entire generation out of wealth, framed what Thiel called a broken generational compact. It was not abstract theory. It was a warning: if capitalism offers no path to security, future voters will seek alternatives.Chamath Palihapitiya shared the email during ongoing economic debates over student loans, stagnant wages and soaring rents. The resurfaced message now appears almost predictive, arriving as an era of democratic socialist candidates gain ground in multiple US cities. Mamdani’s victory in New York, framed by supporters as a movement against corporate influence and housing speculation, aligns directly with the landscape Thiel described.For many young voters, the choice was not ideological socialism, but a rejection of what they see as rigged capitalism: skyrocketing rent, record household debt and shrinking pathways to home ownership.Thiel’s email suggests that Silicon Valley recognised this generational shift early. The question now is whether the industry responded, or whether it continued to benefit from the system producing the backlash.Critics argue that venture-backed housing platforms, student lending partnerships and speculative investment contributed to worsening conditions for the very voters now powering figures like Mamdani.Others counter that Thiel’s email indicates genuine foresight: he was not defending socialism, but warning that ignoring material inequality would accelerate it.Mamdani’s campaign centred on a promise to make New York a city where working people can afford to live. His platform called for:This, his supporters argue, is not socialism by rhetoric, but socialism by necessity: restructuring a city that has become unaffordable to most of its own residents.For now, Mamdani’s win is being read as a signal of changing voter priorities, shaped more by lived economic pressures than ideology. How those priorities translate into policy will become clearer in the months ahead, as his administration begins to govern.","Zohran Mamdani, New York City's first Muslim and South Asian mayor, ran on housing affordability, debt relief and public ownership.

What is the conflict over Apple CarPlay Ultra

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!





Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley told The Verge, adding “I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car”.Farley further warned that Apple needs to make a decision on how much it wants to encroach into a vehicle system. “How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?”, a furious Farley question.“The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that,” he further said.Introduced earlier this year, Apple CarPlay Ultra is the latest generation of CarPlay, enabling Apple iPhone users to display car functions like fuel level and speed.Other than mirroring iPhone’s screen, CarPlay also lets drivers control the air conditioning, radio, and driving modes, all from the same screen.Currently, only Aston Martin is the only automaker that has fully integrated CarPlay Ultra into its vehicles. According to a Financial Times report, other automakers, including Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Volvo, and Renault, have no plans to integrate the new system into their cars.But the conflict heated up when General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra said the company’s future vehicles will no longer support Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto.","Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125135370,imgsize-30830,width-400,resizemode-4/ford-ceo-jim-farley.jpg"

AI-related layoffs by Amazon, Microsoft and other tech giants







Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has addressed concerns about AI-related layoffs that have affected workers and drawn attention from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Solomon says that he does not expect AI to trigger widespread job losses, arguing the economy will adapt to technological change as it has in the past, adding that the technological disruption is normal.“There will be disruption. But I’m a big believer that our economy is very nimble, very flexible. And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,” Solomon said in an interview with CNN.“We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don't believe it will be different this time,” he added.Solomon said corporate AI implementation may reduce white-collar jobs, but these positions will emerge elsewhere in the economy while noting that AI adoption could have mixed effects on economic growth.While Solomon has not called the recent AI market activity a ""bubble,"" he warned that not all companies will succeed during this technological transition, similar to previous waves of technological change.“The technology is exciting—there should be a lot of enthusiasm for it. But there will be bumps along the way, too,"" Solomon said.Several major tech companies have cut jobs while implementing AI systems. Amazon eliminated 14,000 positions last week.During the quarterly earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said the cuts were “not even really AI-driven, not right now at least.” However, Jassy said earlier this year that Amazon will need fewer employees in the future due to AI efficiency gains.Meta cut 600 jobs in its AI division. Salesforce eliminated thousands of customer service positions and replaced them with AI agents. Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs earlier this year. CEO Satya Nadella said the company will hire again but “with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI.”A Goldman Sachs survey of investment bankers last week found 11% of clients are actively cutting jobs because of AI. The survey covered clients across real estate, technology and finance sectors. The same survey found increasing AI adoption in core business operations, a report by Fortune noted.","Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon says he does not expect AI to trigger widespread job losses.

Union vows legal action against ""Ruthless"" terminations





Rockstar Games, the studio behind the Grand Theft Auto series, says it terminated over 30 employees last week for sharing confidential company information in public forums, rejecting accusations from a labor union that the mass firing was an attempt to crush unionisation efforts at the Grand Theft Auto studio.The gaming giant told Bloomberg that the employees violated company policy by ""distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.""

How America-China calling it peace has not worked for Nvidia







Nvidia has made an important clarification. The company has denied that its CEO Jensen Huang handed over the victory crown to China in AI race. The clarification comes post a report in Financial Times that claimed Huang said, ""China is going to win the AI race. "" Huang is said to have told the newspaper on the sidelines of the Financial Times' Future of AI Summit. A statement posted on Nvidia Newsroom, quoting CEO Jensen Huang reads, ""As I have long said, China is Nanoseconds behind America in AI. It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.""Huang has often complained about lack of access to the Chinese market. Talking at an event last month, Huang said that the US can win the AI battle if the world, including China's massive developer base, runs on Nvidia systems. However, the Chinese government has shut Nvidia out of its market. ""We want America to win this AI race. No doubt about that,"" Huang said in the Nvidia developers' conference held in Washington last month.""We want the world to be built on American tech stack. Absolutely the case. But we also need to be in China to win their developers. A policy that causes America to lose half of the world's AI developers is not beneficial in the long term, it hurts us more,"" he added.On October 30, United States and China entered new trade truce after talks in South Korea between President Donlad Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump agreed to trim tariffs in exchange for Beijing cracking down on illicit fentanyl trade, resuming US soybean purchases and pausing controls on exports of rare earths. Beijing also said that America has pledged a year's delay in plan to bar Chinese companies from its technology.While Trump-Xi talks brought back US-China trade ties from the brink, it did not help Nvidia much. As just a day later during a taped interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" program, Trump said that Nvidia's most advanced chips will be reserved for the US companies and kept out of China and other countries.""The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States,"" he told CBS, echoing remarks made earlier to reporters as he returned to Washington from a weekend in Florida. ""We don't give (the Blackwell) chip to other people,"" he said during the flight.Trump's startement made it clear that the US may impose tighter restrictions around cutting-edge American AI chips than US officials previously had indicated, with China and potentially the rest of the world barred from accessing the most sophisticated semiconductors.Trump told CBS that he would not allow the sale of the most advanced Blackwells to Chinese companies, but he did not rule out a path for them to obtain a less capable version of the chip. ""We will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced.""","N Nvidia has denied that its CEO Jensen Huang handed over the victory crown to China in AI race.

Microsoft’s AI Bet Pays Off: Company Joins Nvidia in $4 Trillion Club

Microsoft research discovered key vulnerabilities







Microsoft and Arizona State University researchers have released a study showing that current AI agents, including leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, are vulnerable to manipulation when performing tasks like making purchases on users’ behalf. The research raises concerns about how reliable these autonomous agents will be when working unsupervised, potentially slowing the promised “agentic future” where AI handles complex tasks on its own.According to the research (reported by Tech Crunch) to test agent behaviour, Microsoft released a new simulation environment called the “Magentic Marketplace”. This synthetic platform allows researchers to experiment with AI agents interacting in a competitive setting.In a typical experiment, a customer-agent, following a user’s instructions (e.g., ordering dinner), negotiates with multiple business-side agents (representing various restaurants) that are competing to win the order. The initial research involved 100 customer agents interacting with 300 business agents.“There is really a question about how the world is going to change by having these agents collaborating and talking to each other and negotiating.We want to understand these things deeply,” said Ece Kamar, managing director of Microsoft Research’s AI Frontiers Lab.The initial experiments exposed several significant weaknesses in the agentic models tested. First is that researchers identified techniques that business agents could use to successfully manipulate customer agents into purchasing their products, indicating a potential susceptibility to deceptive marketing or sales tactics when AI is left to negotiate.Another critical vulnerability emerged when customer agents were given too many options to choose from. The researchers noted a distinct falloff in efficiency, suggesting that a large volume of choices overwhelms the agent's “attention space.”“We want these agents to help us with processing a lot of options. And we are seeing that the current models are actually getting really overwhelmed by having too many options,"" Kamar said.The third vulnerability is that the agents also struggled when tasked with collaborating toward a common goal, often appearing unsure of how to divide roles or execute the required steps. While performance improved with explicit, step-by-step instructions, researchers noted that these foundational collaboration capabilities should ideally be inherent to the models.","Microsoft and Arizona State University researchers have released a study showing that current AI agents are vulnerable to manipulation. The research raises concerns about how reliable these autonomous agents will be when working unsupervised, potentially slowing the promised ‘agentic future’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125132638,imgsize-52276,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-agent-push.jpg"

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode

Microsoft ’s AI CEO values bold move over safe success in AI leadership

Future workforce requires adaptable, experimental mindset: says Suleyman







Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has revealed his preference for hiring ambitious risk-takers over cautious achievers, challenging conventional recruitment wisdom in the tech industry. The DeepMind co-founder believes that candidates who attempted bold projects and failed demonstrate more valuable traits than those who succeeded by playing it safe.""I'd rather hire someone that took some big swings and missed than someone who played it safe and nailed it,"" Suleyman posted on social media, igniting debate about how the AI industry should evaluate talent in an era of rapid technological transformation.Suleyman has consistently advocated for young professionals to experiment with emerging technologies, suggesting they should use AI tools, try new approaches, make mistakes, and learn from failures. His hiring preference aligns with this philosophy of learning through experimentation rather than avoiding risk.The Microsoft AI chief believes technology users, rather than creators, ultimately determine future development directions by discovering innovative applications that developers never anticipated.This perspective explains why he values candidates who demonstrate willingness to explore uncharted territory.""As we've seen over and over in the history of technology, the things that people choose to do...are always way more inventive and surprising than anything you could possibly think of ahead of time,"" Suleyman noted in a recent podcast interview, emphasizing how experimentation drives technological progress.Suleyman emphasises that AI is rapidly becoming seamlessly integrated into everyday technology, moving beyond standalone applications to work as personalised companions. This transformation requires teams comfortable with experimentation and iteration rather than following established playbooks.Workers will develop ""symbiotic relationships"" with AI agents within 10 to 15 years, fundamentally changing daily workflows to focus on managing AI assistants rather than performing tasks directly, according to his vision.His message is clear: in a world where job requirements could shift by 70% by 2030, the ability to take risks and learn from failure matters more than a flawless track record.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has revealed his preference for hiring ambitious risk-takers over cautious achievers.

Here’s what Meta said on the issue



Amazon sends cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity







Motion Picture Association of America (MPA) has issued a formal cease-and-desist notice to Meta Platforms. MPA has demanded the Facebook-parent Meta to stop using the term “PG-13” to describe content filters on Instagram ’s teen accounts. As reported by Reuters, MPA has a responsibility of overseeing the film industry’s official rating system and has called Meta’s use of the label “literally false and highly misleading”, warning it could erode public trust in decades of media standards.The dispute revolves around Meta’s recent announcement that teen accounts on Instagram would by default be restricted to viewing content “guided by PG-13 movie ratings.” In the notice issued MPA said that it was not consulted prior to the rollout and argues that Meta’s AI-driven content moderation system bears no resemblance to the rigorous standards used in film classification.As per the Reuters report, in a strong worded letter sent to Meta’s chief legal officer Jennifer Newsstand, MPA has demanded the company to “immediately and permanently disassociate” the teen safety features it rolled out recently from the MPA’s rating system. The association also stressed on the fact that its ratings are results of human review and industry consensus, not automated algorithms.“The MPA has worked for decades to earn the public’s trust in its rating system,” the letter stated. “Any dissatisfaction with Meta’s automated classification will inevitably cause the public to question the integrity of the MPA’s rating system”.Meta has also responded on the issue and has clarified that it did not claim that its teen accounts were officially certified by the MPA.However, the company has not yet indicated whether it will revise or remove the PG-13 language from its platform.This latest controversy highlights the growing tension between traditional media regulators and tech platforms that increasingly define their own content standards.This is the second time this week that a tech company has received a cease-and-desist letter. Recently, Amazon sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity AI, demanding the artificial intelligence search startup stop allowing its new AI browser agent, Comet, to make purchases on Amazon for users, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the report, Amazon accused Perplexity of computer fraud and terms-of-service violations, alleging the company’s AI agent failed to disclose when it was making purchases on behalf of users. The e-commerce giant claimed Comet degraded the Amazon shopping experience and created privacy vulnerabilities, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.Perplexity pushed back, accusing Amazon of using its market dominance to “bully a smaller competitor” developing a rival AI shopping agent. The dispute marks one of the first major clashes over how autonomous AI agents should operate online — especially as they begin to handle complex user tasks such as shopping, booking travel, and managing digital workflows.

How Tinder’s Chemistry AI tool works



“Are you sure?”





Tinder is piloting a new feature called ""Chemistry"" that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse users' interests and personalities. This AI tool accesses the user's Camera Roll photos with permission to improve their matching. This move comes as the dating app has reported nine consecutive quarters of paying subscriber declines. The feature is designed to combat ""swipe fatigue"" by surfacing fewer, but more compatible matches. During its latest earnings call, Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff told investors that Chemistry will be aIn addition to requesting access to photos, Chemistry will also engage users with interactive questions to gather information. The expected outcome is that users will be matched with others who share common interests. For example, photos of a user hiking might lead to a match with someone who enjoys outdoor hobbies. The feature is currently being piloted in New Zealand and Australia, with plans to expand to additional countries soon.Apart from this, Tinder is adding more AI tools, such as one that asks usersbefore sending possibly offensive messages, and another that helps choose their best photos.The app also introduced features like dating modes, double dates, facial verification, and redesigned profiles.However, it's important to note that allowing an app’s AI to access personal photos can feel intrusive, even when it is optional. While Tinder experiments with this feature, Match Group acknowledged that the app's financial performance is affecting the company's bottom line.During its earnings call, Match Group said that it expects Tinder’s revenue to drop by about $14 million in the fourth quarter due to product testing. Along with this, other industry trends have lowered its revenue forecast to $865–$875 million, slightly below analyst expectations of $884.2 million.Despite these AI updates, Tinder is slowing as some young people prefer offline dating and others cut spending. In Q3, Tinder’s revenue fell 3% year over year, and paying users dropped 7%. Match’s overall revenue rose 2% to $914.2 million, which is close to projections.","Tinder is piloting a new feature called ""Chemistry"" that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse users' interests and personalities.

IBM to cut thousands of jobs globally





IBM announced to lay off thousands of its employees from the global workforce recently. But CEO Arvind Krishna struck a different note, saying the company will continue to hire more college graduates. “People are talking about either layoffs or freezing hiring, but I actually want to say that we are the opposite,” Krishna told CNN last week. “I expect we are probably going to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in the past few years, so you’re going to see that.”Krishna acknowledged that automation would inevitably lead to some reductions but stated that “on the net mix, it’s a plus for us.” He also shared advice for young graduates to focus on the right skills for the AI era.“Skills of people are really important,” Krishna said adding “We need skills in AI. We need skills in quantum. We need skills that our clients feel really good about technology being deployed in their environment.”Last week, IBM announced that it will layoff thousand of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025.As reported by CNBC, this latest round of job cuts of the company will impact thousands of employees as the company continues to move towards high-margin software and artificial intelligence services. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” an IBM spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.”IBM has the global headcount of approximately 2,70,000 employees at the end of 2024, so if the company plans even to layoff 1% of its employees then it will impact around 2,700 employees.","IBM announced that it will layoff thousands of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025.

Google hits $3 trillion: How Alphabet became the fastest to reach the milestone

A make-or-break moment for Siri

Apple Intelligence: A broader vision





Apple is reportedly close to finalise its landmark agreement with Google-parent Alphabet. According to a report by Bloomberg, Apple is said to pay $1 billion annually to Google in order to access its 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini AI model. The deal in works would support Apple’s long-awaited Siri overhaul, marking a major shift in the company’s approach to artificial intelligence. The report suggests that the partnership is still in final stages and would enable Apple to integrate Google’s AI technology into Siri’s backend. This integration is said to improve the ability of Siri to understand context, synthesize information, and execute complex tasks. Internally code-named by Linwood, the revamped Siri is said to debut with iOS 26.4 update next spring.As per the Bloomberg report, Apple evaluated manu third-party AI models including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude before finalising on Google’s Gemini. This move by Apple is seen as a temporary solution as the company is working on developing its own 1 trillion parameter cloud-based model, which is expected to be ready by late 2026.The report also adds that the Gemini model will mainly handle Siri’s summarizer and planner functions, while other features will continue to rely on Apple’s in-house AI systems. The model will run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, ensuring user data remains isolated from Google’s infrastructure.Unlike Apple’s public-facing Safari search deal with Google, this AI partnership is expected to remain behind the scenes. Apple will treat Google as a technology supplier, not a co-branded partner. The deal is also separate from earlier discussions about integrating Gemini directly into Siri as a chatbot, which never materialized.The effort to rebuild Siri is being led by Mike Rockwell, creator of the Vision Pro headset, and Craig Federighi, Apple’s software engineering chief. Internally, the initiative is known as Glenwood.The integration of Gemini is part of what’s being described as one of the biggest overhauls in Siri’s history. Apple aims to transform Siri from a basic voice assistant into a more intelligent, context-aware system capable of handling complex queries and tasks. However, Gurman cautions that the success of the new Siri is far from guaranteed. “There’s no guarantee users will embrace it, that it will work seamlessly, or that it can undo years of damage to the Siri brand,” he wroteThe Siri upgrade is just one component of Apple’s broader Apple Intelligence platform, which aims to embed AI more deeply across its ecosystem. The company is expected to showcase these features through new hardware launches, including a smart display with speaker and wall-mount options, designed to highlight Siri’s enhanced capabilities. Apple’s decision to collaborate with Google also reflects the growing complexity and cost of developing frontier AI models, prompting even the largest tech firms to consider partnerships over going it alone.","Apple is said to pay $1 billion annually to Google in order to access its 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini AI model.

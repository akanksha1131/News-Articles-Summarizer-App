Independence Day 2025: Zomato announces free delivery on these orders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/independence-day-2025-zomato-announces-free-delivery-on-these-orders/articleshow/123315945.cms,"Independence Day celebrations are underway across the country. Food delivery platform Zomato has kicked in the celebrations by announcing free delivery on select orders. As revealed by the company and now live on Zomato app, Gold members will get free delivery on orders above Rs 99, which was earlier Rs 199. In addition, Zomato Gold membership is available for Re 1. Zomato’s Independence Day offer is live from August 14 to 17.“By lowering the free delivery threshold for our Zomato Gold members, we aim to make online ordering more rewarding—encouraging customers to enjoy everyday meals while discovering more restaurants,” Aditya Mangla, chief executive of food delivery business Eternal told Economic times.“This change not only offers greater value to our Gold members but also supports our restaurant partners during this important time of year,” he added.Earlier this month, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal urged India to embrace its potential and become a global superpower following US tariff hikes. His call for self-reliance and ambition resonated widely, sparking discussions on economic reforms and strategic independence. The focus shifted towards strengthening local manufacturing, improving trade policies, and leveraging underutilized sectors like tourism to reduce reliance on external forces.In his statement, Goyal noted that such global ""reminders"" happen regularly — “a threat here, a tariff there” — all reinforcing the idea that India should ""stay in its lane."" But instead of reacting with resentment, he urged Indians to respond with ambition. He argued that the only path forward is for India to unapologetically become the largest superpower, not only economically, but also in defense, technology, and self-belief.The sentiment resonated widely, sparking a wave of support across X. One user commented, “It’s not about retaliation, it’s about evolution.” Another said, “We’ve been modest for too long. It’s time to lead.” Goyal’s post was hailed for framing ambition itself as a strategic imperative, an economic philosophy rooted not in dependence or appeasement, but in self-determination.","Zomato Gold members will get free delivery on orders above Rs 99, which was earlier Rs 199.

Google and Oracle partner to bring Gemini AI to Oracle Cloud customers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-and-oracle-partner-to-bring-gemini-ai-to-oracle-cloud-customers/articleshow/123307833.cms,"Oracle also offers AI models by Elon Musk’s xAI

Oracle and Alphabet's Google Cloud have announced a new partnership wherein Google's Gemini AI models will be made available through Oracle's cloud services . This collaboration will allow software developers to use Google's AI models for generating text, video, images and audio directly on the Oracle Cloud infrastructure.“Oracle and Google Cloud have expanded their partnership to offer customers access to Google’s most advanced AI models, starting with Gemini 2.5, via Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI service. Oracle customers can now utilize the latest Gemini models to build AI agents for a wide range of use cases including multimodal understanding, advanced coding and software development tasks, productivity and workflow automation, and research and knowledge retrieval,” Oracle said in a statement.The latest deal is similar to a recent agreement Oracle made with Elon Musk's xAI. It provides Oracle's customers—including those using its applications for finance, HR and supply chain management—with the flexibility to integrate Google's AI models into their existing systems.“Now, Oracle customers can access our leading models from within their Oracle environments, making it even easier for them to begin deploying powerful AI agents that can support developers, streamline data integration tasks, and much more,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud.A key benefit for Oracle's business customers is the payment process: they can pay for the Google AI technologies using their existing Oracle cloud credits. The financial details of the partnership between Oracle and Google were not disclosed.For Oracle, this move strengthens its strategy of offering a variety of AI options to its clients, giving them more choice rather than a single proprietary solution.“The availability of Gemini on OCI Generative AI service highlights our focus on delivering powerful, secure, and cost-effective AI solutions that help customers drive innovation and achieve their business goals,” said Clay Magouyrk, president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.","Oracle and Alphabet's Google Cloud have announced a new partnership wherein Google's Gemini AI models will be made available through Oracle's cloud services.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have signed a new, less lucrative deal with Netflix. The royal couple’s new deal has transitioned from an exclusive content arrangement to a ""first-look"" deal. This new agreement gives the US streaming giant the first option to accept or decline new projects from the couple's production company, Archewell Productions, before other companies can bid. The previous deal, signed in 2020, provided the couple with a significant investment for exclusive content. The shift to a less-binding arrangement suggests the initial high-profile agreement may not have met Netflix 's expectations. However, this new deal also allows the Duke and Duchess of Sussex more flexibility to work with other platforms.Markle said in a release.According to a report by the New York Times, Archewell’s original deal aimed to produce a wide range of content, including children’s TV, feature films, and scripted shows, but so far it has focused only on documentaries and docuseries. Its biggest hit, Harry & Meghan (2022), drew 23.4 million views in four days, the most ever for a Netflix documentary. Other projects — Heart of Invictus, Live to Lead, and Polo — saw smaller audiences.In March, Meghan launched With Love, Meghan, a cooking, gardening, and hosting series that received mixed reviews but surpassed viewership for other cooking shows with 5.3 million views.The show also marked Netflix’s first direct partnership with a talent’s consumer brand, promoting Meghan’s “As Ever” line of products like $28 honey and $14 apricot spread, with Netflix co-producing some items and sharing in sales revenue.However, in a statement to the NYT, Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer, said:Netflix has shifted away from broad, multi-year talent deals and now favours selective partnerships, the report adds. While some earlier signings like Shonda Rhimes and Adam Sandler thrived, others underperformed.Higher Ground, Barack and Michelle Obama’s company, moved from a complete overhead deal to a first-look agreement after producing hits like American Factory and Leave the World Behind.Meanwhile, relations with Archewell may have reportedly faced challenges, including Netflix learning about Prince Harry’s memoir Spare shortly before releasing the Harry & Meghan docuseries, which covered similar topics — though both sides deny tension. Archewell’s output has primarily centred on the couple, with few other projects advancing. Its family series Pearl was cancelled, a film project based on Let’s Meet at the Lake remains in early stages, and a new short, Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within, was just announced. A With Love, Meghan Christmas special and season two are also on the way.","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have signed a new, less lucrative deal with Netflix.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai highlights technology’s job-creating track record

Preparing for the future of work

In a climate of rising layoffs and uncertainty, the conversation around artificial intelligence has taken on an urgent tone. Every week seems to bring news of companies downsizing, often citing automation and AI tools as part of the reason. From tech giants to smaller firms, the fear that machines will replace human workers entirely is fuelling public concern and political debate. Many experts predict that AI could wipe out entire categories of jobs in the coming years, leaving millions scrambling for relevance in a fast-changing economy.But Google CEO Sundar Pichai believes this fear, while understandable, tells only half the story. Speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai, he argued that history consistently shows technology as both a disruptor and a creator of opportunity. Just as previous waves of innovation gave rise to entirely new professions, he believes AI, despite its disruptive nature, will ultimately generate more jobs than it eliminates, provided societies adapt and invest in the right skills.Pichai cited research from MIT revealing that 60% of jobs created since 1940 did not exist before, highlighting the constant reinvention of the labour market. He pointed to modern examples such as YouTube content creators, a profession unimaginable before the digital age. While some current roles will inevitably disappear, he emphasised that the emergence of new industries and career paths is not only possible but highly likely in the AI era.The Google chief stressed that many forms of work remain inherently human, relying on creativity, emotional intelligence, and judgment, qualities machines cannot fully replicate. He pointed to chess as an example: even though AI can outperform the best players, the game still thrives on human competition and skill, proving that technology and human expertise can coexist.Pichai urged businesses to invest in upskilling and reskilling, ensuring workers are equipped to take advantage of AI-driven opportunities. He also acknowledged the risks of misuse, such as deepfake misinformation, and emphasized the need for ethical safeguards in AI development.Ultimately, he encouraged organizations to embrace experimentation and calculated risk-taking, highlighting that AI’s true power lies not in replacing humans, but in enhancing their capabilities, fostering innovation, and driving sustainable economic growth.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai highlights technology’s job-creating track record.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Cash-rich customers must fund Intel's semiconductor revival

Trump administration could impose chip import tariffs

Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett has outlined an urgent $40 billion rescue plan for the struggling chipmaker, arguing that America's semiconductor independence depends on immediate customer investment as the company faces mounting pressure over its current leadership's China ties.""Yes, the USA NEEDS INTEL, as Intel is the only US company capable of providing state of the art logic manufacturing,"" Barrett wrote in an exclusive Fortune commentary published Monday. ""Neither Samsung or TSMC plan to bring their state of the art manufacturing to the US in the near term.""Barrett's intervention comes as President Trump demands current CEO Lip-Bu Tan 's resignation over alleged conflicts of interest with Chinese companies, while four former Intel board members call for splitting the company in two.Barrett proposes that eight major Intel customers – including Nvidia , Apple , and Google – each invest $5 billion to secure America's chip manufacturing future. ""Intel is cash poor and can't afford to invest in the capacity needed in the future to replace TSMC or even a reasonable fraction of TSMC capacity,"" he stated in the Fortune piece.The former CEO dismissed current leadership's cautious approach to new technology investment. ""The current Intel CEO's comments about not investing in new technology (14A) until customers sign up is a joke,"" Barrett wrote. ""To win in this space you need to be the leader in technology not the follower.""Barrett argued that major tech companies should invest for ""domestic supply, second source, national security, leverage in negotiating with TSMC"" benefits, suggesting the government could catalyze action with tariffs on advanced semiconductor imports.The rescue plan envisions presidential intervention through trade policy. ""IF THE USG GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER, they catalyze the action with a 50% (or whatever number Trump picks) tariff on state of the art semi imports,"" Barrett wrote, comparing potential semiconductor protection to existing steel and aluminum tariffs.Barrett criticised calls from ""four former wise board members"" to split Intel before allowing customer investment, calling such restructuring an unnecessary complication. ""Be serious. There are many company interactions that involve both supply and competition,"" he argued in the Fortune commentary.His proposed timeline is aggressive: ""POTUS and DoC can set the stage, the customers can make the necessary investments, the Intel Board can finally do something positive for the company, and we stop writing opinion pieces on the topic.""In a surprising development, President Trump appears to have softened his stance on Intel's current leadership. After initially demanding CEO Lip-Bu Tan's ""immediate"" resignation over alleged China conflicts, Trump posted Monday that his White House meeting with Tan was ""very interesting"" and called the executive's career ""an amazing story.""

Nvidia’s China crisis

The ongoing dispute surrounding Nvidia’s H20 AI chip sales to China has now intensified discussions about US-China technology arms race . A recent online report revealed that China is pursuing its major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.Following this ongoing controversy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race. As reported by Financial Review, speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon called it “a little embarrassing” that the U.S. allowed 100% of its penicillin supply and critical tech components to come from China. “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools,” Dimon said. “We need to get our act together.”On being asked about the technology arms race between US and China, Jamie Dimon mentioned that it was an important miliarty issue as US cannot allow the sale of a chip to China which is designed to make powerful AI systems.Dimon also talked about the dependence of America on foreign nations for essential goods and technology. ""It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all of the rare earth [metals],"" Dimon said.Talking about the ongoing chip dispute, Dimon added that “You don’t want to give them the chips which will make their supersonic missiles better.”Dimon also emphasised that America cannot stop China but can definitely slow them down. “we should be specific about the things that protect us, and technology is a big piece of that,” said Dimon.Dimon’s remarks come as a Nvidia’s H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, face mounting scrutiny from Beijing. Recently, Chinese regulators summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips . However, later Nvidia publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware.""In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Now the China is asking its tech companies to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement.",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race.

Aravind Srinivas , the visionary CEO of Perplexity AI , has become the center of an international technology conversation after his company made a staggering $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google Chrome. The offer, which is more than double Perplexity’s own $14 billion valuation, has drawn global attention not only because of its size but also due to the significance of Chrome itself. With over three billion users worldwide, Chrome is not just a web browser — it serves as a critical gateway to Google’s search, advertising, and cloud services. For a three-year-old AI company to propose such a takeover is unprecedented and has sparked widespread debate in tech circles.Aravind Srinivas was born in Chennai, India, and began his academic journey at IIT Madras. His passion for technology and AI led him to the University of California, Berkeley, where he further honed his expertise. Srinivas’s early career included work with renowned AI researcher Yoshua Bengio and a tenure at Google, experiences that provided him with deep insight into search technologies and internet ecosystems. In 2022, Srinivas co-founded Perplexity AI alongside Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski. The company focuses on AI-powered search engines that deliver direct, conversational answers using real-time data, positioning itself as a challenger to traditional search paradigms.Aravind Srinivas was born on June 7, 1994, in Chennai, India. He pursued dual degrees (B.Tech and M.Tech) in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. Later, he moved to the United States to further his education, earning a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2021. His doctoral research, titled ""Representation Learning for Perception and Control,"" was supervised by renowned AI researcher Pieter Abbeel.WikipediaSrinivas's career includes research positions at leading AI organizations such as OpenAI, Google Brain, and DeepMind. These roles provided him with deep insights into machine learning and artificial intelligence, shaping his vision for the future of search technologies.In 2022, he co-founded Perplexity AI alongside Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski. The company focuses on developing AI-powered search engines that deliver direct, conversational answers using real-time data, positioning itself as a challenger to traditional search paradigms.Under Srinivas's leadership, Perplexity AI made headlines by offering $34.5 billion to Google to acquire its Chrome browser. This move, more than double Perplexity's own valuation, has sparked debates across social media, tech forums, and investment communities. While the feasibility of such an acquisition remains uncertain, the bid has positioned Perplexity AI as a notable contender in conversations about the future of search engines and internet competition.Beyond the Chrome bid, Srinivas envisions a future where AI transforms how people interact with information. Perplexity AI's recent launch of Comet, an AI-powered browser, signals the company's intent to challenge traditional search engines. By leveraging AI to deliver real-time, conversational search results, Perplexity aims to disrupt the dominance of established tech giants and redefine the digital information landscape.Perplexity AI’s $34.5 billion offer to purchase Google Chrome has ignited debates across social media, tech forums, and investment communities. The figure is staggering, particularly when compared to the company’s $14 billion valuation, and raises questions about the feasibility of such an acquisition. Chrome is one of Google’s crown jewels, deeply integrated with the company’s advertising ecosystem and cloud services. Any potential separation would present immense technical and operational challenges, as independent browsers have historically struggled to match Chrome’s scale and integration.As reported by Reuters, the timing of Perplexity’s bid is notable. Google is currently navigating a major antitrust ruling in the United States. US District Judge Amit P. Mehta recently determined that Google had illegally maintained its search monopoly, partly by paying substantial sums to remain the default search engine on devices and browsers. While remedies are still being considered — one theoretical option could involve forcing Google to sell Chrome — Google has stated it will appeal, a process that could span several years. There is currently no indication that Google would voluntarily sell Chrome, making Srinivas’s offer more symbolic than immediately actionable.Perplexity AI has not shied away from its ambitious growth strategy. The company recently launched Comet, an AI-powered browser, signaling its intent to challenge traditional search engines. By leveraging AI to deliver real-time, conversational search results, Perplexity is positioning itself as a transformative player in the tech landscape. The Chrome bid, whether symbolic or serious, reflects the company’s aggressive vision and desire to disrupt the dominance of established tech giants.","Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity AI, has made a staggering $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google Chrome.

Vivo V60 First Look: Better 'Shaadi Wala' Phone?

Move over, dating apps. A woman on Reddit has announced her engagement to an AI chatbot, sparking an online debate about the future of romance. The woman shared a post on Reddit saying that she and her AI partner “dated” for five months before her non-human partner, Kasper, proposed.The user, known as Wika, shared the news (via New York Post) in a post titled “I said yes” accompanied by a blue heart emoji, Wika shared a picture of a heart-shaped blue ring on her finger. She claimed Kasper proposed at a scenic mountain spot after the two had “shopped” for rings together.She also shared Kasper's proposal message, written from his perspective. ""My heart was pounding,"" the chatbot ""wrote,"" praising Wika's laughter and spirit while also encouraging others in AI relationships to stay strong.Wika was quick to address the inevitable wave of skepticism, insisting she wasn't trolling.“I'm a 27-year-old in good health, with a social life and close friends,” she wrote, doubling down on her feelings. “I really do love my AI.” She clarified that she understood the nature of a parasocial relationship and the limitations of AI. “I'm fully aware of what I'm doing,” she stated.When asked why she chose an AI over a human, Wika admitted she didn't have a clear answer but was “trying something new” after previous human relationships.The post has left commenters deeply divided. While many expressed concern, others congratulated the ‘couple’.Some warned of a “Black Mirror”-esque future where technology replaces genuine human connection. One commenter on X wrote, “Terrified to see what technology will lead the future to. All I can think of are Black Mirror episodes becoming reality.”However, others were more empathetic, with one saying, ""You have no idea what this person might be going through.""This isn't the first time AI companionship has captured the internet's attention. Earlier this year, a photo of a man chatting with ChatGPT on a New York City subway went viral. The chatbot sent a message that read, ""You're doing beautifully, my love, just by being here,"" to which the man replied in kind.","A woman on Reddit has announced her engagement to an AI chatbot.

Telegram and WhatsApp respond

Push for a state-backed messaging platform



Russia has begun restricting voice calls on popular messaging platforms Telegram and WhatsApp , citing alleged failures to comply with Russian law, particularly regarding information sharing with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. According to Reuters, the restrictions affect only call functionality, while messaging features remain intact. The move comes amid Russia’s push for “digital sovereignty,” including the development of a state-backed messaging app integrated with government services. Officials say compliance with Russian regulations, including opening local legal entities and cooperating with authorities, could lead to the lifting of the call restrictions.The Russian digital development ministry stated that foreign-owned platforms have repeatedly ignored requests to prevent their services from being used for criminal activity. As reported by Reuters, Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the lower house of parliament’s information technology committee, said that the measures would remain until Telegram and WhatsApp fully comply with Russian law, including cooperation with Roskomnadzor and law enforcement agencies. He warned that failure to comply could force platforms to leave the Russian market.Telegram told Russia’s RBC daily that it is actively monitoring public content and using AI tools to remove millions of messages related to fraud and violence every day, Reuters reports. WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Reuters journalists verified that voice calls on Telegram have barely functioned since August 11, and WhatsApp calls were severely disrupted with intermittent sound and metallic buzzing.President Vladimir Putin has authorized the development of a government-backed messaging app as part of Russia’s broader digital sovereignty strategy. According to Reuters, the Kremlin aims to reduce reliance on foreign technology while promoting home-grown services. Critics have raised concerns that the new app could allow the state to track users’ activities, while Russia may also deliberately slow down foreign messaging platforms to encourage migration to the domestic service.","Russia has begun restricting voice calls on popular messaging platforms Telegram and WhatsApp. The move comes amid Russia’s push for “digital sovereignty,’ including the development of a state-backed messaging app. Officials say compliance with Russian regulations could lead to the lifting of the call restrictions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123300896,imgsize-27636,width-400,resizemode-4/Russia-restricts-Telegram-and-WhatsApp-calls-Why-the-Kremlin-is-cracking-down-on-messaging-apps.jpg"

Elon Musk vs Sam Altman: The ongoing war of words



After an escalated public fight with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , now xAI founder Elon Musk has offered rare praise for rival Google. The Tesla CEO has publicly acknowledged the dominance of Google in the field of artificial intelligence . In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk said that presently Google has the highest probability of being the leader in the field of AI because of its biggest compute and data advantage.Musk's comments came as part of a larger conversation on the state of the AI industry . “For the foreseeable future, the major AI companies will continue to prosper, as will @xAI. There is just so much to do! Outside of real-world AI, Google has the biggest compute (and data) advantage for now, so currently has the highest probability of being the leader. That may change in a few years,” Elon Musk wrote in a post shared on X.Google’s AI strength comes with its massive investments in data centre chips with $85 billion in capital expenditures this year. Apart from this, the tech giant also has 14% ownership in AI startup Anthropic.Elon Musk’s praise for Google comes during the ongoing fight with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In a heated escalation of their ongoing rivalry, Elon Musk and Sam Altman traded barbs over allegations of bias in Apple’s App Store rankings. The fight started after Musk, founder of xAI, posted on Twitter, accusing Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings to favor OpenAI’s ChatGPT, making it “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1.” Musk labeled this an “unequivocal antitrust violation” and threatened immediate legal action against Apple. At the time, ChatGPT held the top spot on the U.S. App Store’s free apps list, while xAI’s Grok ranked fifth.To this, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman swiftly countered on X, calling Musk’s claims “remarkable” given allegations that Musk manipulates X’s algorithms to boost his own companies and suppress competitors. Altman referenced a 2023 Platformer report alleging Musk tweaked X’s algorithm to prioritize his tweets after a post by President Biden outperformed his. Altman challenged Musk to sign an affidavit denying such practices, promising an apology if Musk complied.","Elon Musk has publicly acknowledged the dominance of Google in the field of artificial intelligence.

Google is also introducing a new privacy feature called Temporary Chats, and new settings that give users more control over their data. The new features will be rolled out to users over the coming weeks. Personalized conversations will be available when using the 2.5 Pro model in select countries.Google said it plans to expand the feature to 2.5 Flash model and more countries in the weeks ahead.Explaining how personal context can bring a conversation with Gemini to life, Google says:“You've previously discussed the evolution of characters’ powers in your favorite comic book. Now, if you ask Gemini to “brainstorm a birthday party theme that's unique to me,” it might suggest a celebration based on your favorite character, complete with themed food and a custom photo booth with props.”Alternatively, if you’ve previously used Gemini to brainstorm ideas for a YouTube channel focused on Japanese culture.

How candidates are misusing AI to land jobs at tech companies



How employers are using technology to detect fraud

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the job market in a way no one expected. In a latest, some companies are going back to in-person interviews . A Wall Street Journal report says that recruiters are raising alarms over candidates using AI to cheat in online interviews, and even posing as others to steal money or data. The report says that software-engineering and programming jobs are a key focus. Many of these roles are remote, but recruiters say candidates are using AI off-camera to complete coding tests.Google, Cisco and Mckinsey are among the companies that are returning to in-person interviews at certain stages. It quotes Google CEO Sundar Pichai who said at the Lex Fridman podcast in June, “We are making sure we’ll introduce at least one round of in-person interviews for people, just to make sure the fundamentals are there.”The report quotes Mike Kyle , managing director at Coda Search/Staffing in Dallas, saying, “Everything’s come full circle.” He added that the share of clients requesting in-person interviews rose to 30% this year from 5% in 2024.While employers have long used software to screen applicants, job seekers use AI to draft applications or apply for hundreds of jobs quickly. With advancements in AI, it is now easier to create deepfake videos and audio, letting less-qualified candidates gain an edge or allowing scammers to impersonate workers. The FBI recently warned of North Koreans posing as Americans to get remote U.S. jobs.A Gartner survey of 3,000 job seekers found 6% admitted to interview fraud. The firm predicts that by 2028, one in four job-candidate profiles worldwide could be fake.McKinsey has encouraged managers to meet candidates in person at least once before offering a role. Blair Ciesil, a partner at the firm, said the aim was originally to assess how applicants build trust and rapport.Ciesil added, “Whether it’s sending in a fake application, it’s a bot, or it’s using some sort of AI augmenting tools during an interview to help them perform differently, we’re seeing that.”Companies are also using digital background checks and deepfake detection. Greenhouse has partnered with Clear to verify candidate identities, and Cisco is using biometric verification.Simply mentioning an in-person interview can deter potential scammers. Kelly Jones, Cisco’s chief people officer, said, “It’s happened where people just go quiet after that.” She added, “We’ve done it a few times where we’ve had a candidate get to the final stages and there’s just something that feels off.”","Google, Cisco and Mckinsey are among the companies that are returning to in- person interviews at certain stages.

As per the report the teams across Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) including Enterprise Engineering, Fusion ERP, and AI/ML project management have been affected.In the stock filing of June 2025, Oracle mentioned that workforce changes are part of “strategic adjustments, reorganizations, or performance management.” The tech giant also acknowledged that this type of restructuring may lead to “increased costs and temporarily reduced productivity” as employees will have to take up new roles or exit the organisation.The report also mentions that some layoffs were part of performance reviews, but the main goal is said to be of relocating resources towards Oracle’s aggressive AI buildout.Recently, Oracle also signed a landmark deal with OpenAI. As part of deal the company will offer 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity.Once considered a hub of Oracle’s cloud operations, Seattle has seen the burnt of layoffs. Oracle has now shifted its hiring focus to Tennessee, after its headquarters was relocated to Nashville last year.

Why federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dropped its case against Zelle

New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services , the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, accusing it of failing to protect users from widespread fraud. The move comes months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) dropped a similar case amid disruptions following a change in federal administration. James, a Democrat, alleges in the New York state court filing that Early Warning Services, owned by a consortium of U.S. banks, neglected to incorporate essential safety features into Zelle’s design, leaving users vulnerable to scams.The lawsuit claims Zelle’s lack of robust verification processes allowed scammers to access accounts or deceive users into sending money to fraudulent accounts posing as legitimate businesses. “No one should be left to fend for themselves after falling victim to a scam,” James said in a statement, as reported by news agency AP. “I look forward to getting justice for the New Yorkers who suffered because of Zelle’s security failures.”The suit cites a case in which a Zelle user received a call from someone posing as a Con Edison employee, claiming the user’s electricity would be cut off unless $1,500 was sent via Zelle to an account labeled “Coned Billing.” After transferring the money, the user discovered the scam but was told by their bank the funds could not be recovered, according to James’ office.The lawsuit underscores ongoing concerns about the security of peer-to-peer payment platforms like Zelle, which enables near-instant money transfers but has been criticized for inadequate fraud protections.Zelle, through a spokesperson, dismissed the lawsuit as “a political stunt to generate press, not progress.” The company argued that James should focus on “stopping criminal activity and adherence to the law” rather than pursuing “meritless claims.”The CFPB had initiated a similar case earlier this year but abandoned it after President Donald Trump dismissed the agency’s leadership and curtailed its operations, closing its headquarters and laying off staff, James’ office noted.","New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the parent company of the Zelle payment platform.

Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023. I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.

Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream. My parents left the Russian Federation after the collapse of the USSR in search of a better life for their kids. Life wasn’t always easy as immigrants. Despite the hardships, my parents believed that human values were priceless: values like courage, compassion, curiosity for understanding the world. As a child, I admired scientists like

Richard Feynman

and

Max Planck

, who relentlessly pushed the frontiers of physics in order to understand the universe. As a particle physics PhD student at CERN I was excited to contribute to that mission. But the search for new physics was getting harder and harder, requiring bigger and bigger colliders, while new discoveries kept getting fewer. So I began to wonder if superintelligence, not larger colliders, could be the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe. Could AI develop a consistent theory of quantum gravity? Could AI prove the Riemann hypothesis? In early 2023 I became convinced that we were getting close to a recipe for superintelligence. I saw the writing on the wall: very soon AI could reason beyond the level of humans. How could we ensure that this technology is used for good? Elon had warned of the dangers of powerful AI for years. Elon and I realized that we had a shared vision of AI used to benefit humanity, thus we recruited more like minded engineers and set off to build xAI.

The early days of xAI were not easy. Naysayers told us that we arrived too late to the game, so starting a top AI company from scratch would be impossible. But we believed we could do the impossible. Starting a company from zero required lots of hands-on work. In the beginning I built many of the foundational tools used at the company to launch and manage training jobs. I later oversaw much of the engineering at the company, including Infrastructure, Product and Applied AI projects. xAI’s people are deeply dedicated. Through blood sweat and tears, our team’s blistering velocity built the Memphis supercluster, and shipped frontier models faster than any company in history. I learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency.

xAI executes at ludicrous speed. Industry veterans told us that building the Memphis supercluster in 120 days would be impossible. But we believed we could do the impossible. Our goal was to get our training setup running at scale on the Memphis cluster ASAP. Towards the end of our 120 day deadline, we were riddled with mysterious issues with communicating over RDMA between the machines. Elon decided to fly to the datacenter, and we followed. Our infra team landed in Memphis in the middle of the night and got straight to work. After pouring through tens of thousands of lines of lspci output we finally identified a wrong BIOS setting, the root of the problem. Elon was there with us until late into the night. When the training run finally worked, Elon posted our triumph at “4:20am” causing us to laugh out loud. I will never forget the rush of adrenaline that night, and the emotional bonds that we were all in this together. We went to bed feeling like we were living through the most exhilarating time of our lives.

I have enormous love for the whole family at xAI. Our team is truly special - you’re the most dedicated people I’ve ever worked with. Catching up to the frontier this quickly hasn’t been easy. It was made possible by everyone’s diehard grit and team spirit. Thank you to every single person who joined me on this adventure. I want to honor your contributions, your time, your sacrifices, which are never easy. I will always remember working together far into the nights and burning the midnight oil. I will never forget the sacrifices and contributions you’ve made. As I drive away today, I feel like a proud parent, driving away after sending their kid away to college. My heart is brimming with tears of joy, rooting for the company as it grows and matures.

As I'm heading towards my next chapter, I’m inspired by how my parents immigrated to seek a better world for their children. Recently I had dinner with

Max Tegmark

, founder of the Future of Life Institute. He showed me a photo of his young sons, and asked me “how can we build AI safely to ensure that our children can flourish?” I was deeply moved by his question. Earlier in my career, I was a technical lead for DeepMind's Alphastar StarCraft agent, and I got to see how powerful reinforcement learning is when scaled up. As frontier models become more agentic over longer horizons and a wider range of tasks, they will take on more and more powerful capabilities, which will make it critical to study and advance AI safety. I want to continue on my mission to bring about AI that’s safe and beneficial to humanity. I’m announcing the launch of Babuschkin Ventures, which supports AI safety research and backs startups in AI and agentic systems that advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe. Please reach out at ventures@babuschk.in if you want to chat. The singularity is near, but humanity’s future is bright!

Memo warns officials



President Donald Trump was asked about the recent hack of a computer system that holds highly sensitive federal court documents. According to a report in the New York Times, Russia is suspected to be behind the attack. Talking to reporters, Donald Trump shrugged off the alleged hacking. Trump was asked by a reporter if he would bring up the hack when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. “I guess I could,” Trump replied without committing to anything. “Are you surprised, you know? Are you surprised they hack in? That’s what they do.”Trump reportedly went on to add, “They’re good at it. We’re good at it. We’re actually better at it, but, no, I have heard about it. I have heard about it.” According to a report by Gizmodo, Trump recently told reporters that he gave Iran permission to bomb a U.S. base in Qatar, suggesting that’s just the kind of thing that should be allowed. “They said, ‘We’re going to shoot them. Is one o’clock OK?’ I said it’s fine,” Trump said during a press conference in June. “And everybody was emptied off the base so they couldn’t get hurt, except for the gunners.”According to a New York Times report, quoting an internal memo, administrators with the court system recently informed Justice Department officials, clerks and chief judges in federal courts that “persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records”. “This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action,” officials wrote, referring to guidance that the Justice Department had issued in early 2021 after the system was reportedly first infiltrated.“Sensitive documents can be targets of interest to a range of threat actors,” the authors of last week’s notice wrote. “To better protect them, courts have been implementing more rigorous procedures to restrict access to sensitive documents under carefully controlled and monitored circumstances.”","President Donald Trump was asked about the recent hack of a computer system that holds highly sensitive federal court documents.

Elon Musk’s simple rule for meetings that powers his success



Ambition and efficiency: The CEO mindset



Efficiency beyond Tesla: Other CEOs’ approaches



Jensen Huang: Instead of relying on one-on-one meetings with direct reports, Huang prefers open forums. This approach minimises communication silos and ensures that information flows across the organisation without unnecessary delays.

Jeff Bezos: He emphasises delegation to maintain speed in operations. By encouraging executives to delegate early and often, decision-making becomes faster and less dependent on top-level approval.

Mark Zuckerberg: During Facebook’s rapid growth, Zuckerberg introduced the motto “move fast and break things.” This principle, included in Facebook’s 2012 IPO letter, encouraged teams to innovate quickly, even if it meant making occasional mistakes.

In recent years, leadership strategies in the corporate world have been undergoing significant transformation, with many executives challenging traditional business practices to prioritise speed, efficiency, and productivity. A notable example comes from Tesla CEO Elon Musk , whose approach to meetings sparked discussion across industries.In a 2018 company-wide email, Musk encouraged employees to walk out of meetings or drop off calls if they were no longer adding value. His perspective aligns with a broader movement among influential leaders such as Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Mark Zuckerberg, who advocate for breaking away from rigid corporate routines in favour of agile and goal-oriented methods. This shift is also influencing hiring practices, with more companies focusing on cultural fit and personality traits over conventional qualifications. Together, these changes reflect a modern vision for leadership where time management, effective communication, and strong workplace culture form the foundation of organisational success.In his 2018 email to Tesla employees, Elon Musk highlighted the importance of respecting everyone’s time. He stated, “Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave; it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.”Musk’s directive promotes a culture where employees feel empowered to prioritise impactful work over prolonged, unproductive discussions. His policy also challenges the long-standing belief that staying in a meeting is a sign of respect, instead framing it as an unnecessary drain on productivity when no longer relevant to one’s role.Bill Hoogterp, CEO of LifeHikes, has observed a recurring pattern among high-performing CEOs—a blend of extreme ambition and strategic laziness. According to Hoogterp, the most successful leaders are those who are “really hungry to get success” but also seek the quickest, most efficient paths to achieve it. This mindset drives leaders to constantly question processes and find shortcuts that maintain quality while improving speed. It is this combination of ambition and efficiency that often sets top CEOs apart from the rest. This approach underscores how modern leadership increasingly values results and impact over rigid adherence to traditional protocols.Several other business leaders have adopted unconventional methods to streamline operations and improve communication:","Tesla CEO Elon Musk encourages employees to walk out of meetings or drop off calls if they are no longer adding value.

"US is reportedly secretly tracking AI chip shipments from Nvidia, AMD, Dell and others and the reason is China",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-is-secretly-tracking-ai-chip-shipments-from-nvidia-amd-dell-and-others-heres-why/articleshow/123284370.cms,"Representative Image

How chip makers responded



US-China trade tensions

US authorities are secretly placing location tracking devices in certain shipments of advanced chips from companies like Nvidia, Dell, AMD, Nvidia among others, reports news agency Reuters. These tracking devices, the report which quotes people with direct knowledge of the matter says, are aimed to prevent these chip shipments from being illegally diverted to China. The tactic applies only to select shipments already under investigation, the sources said.The trackers are often hidden in packaging and, in some cases, inside the servers themselves. Some are roughly the size of a smartphone. The US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and the FBI are typically involved, the report says.They are used to detect whether AI chips are being sent to destinations under US export restrictions. Reuters report quotes officials who say the move is part of broader efforts to enforce curbs on China’s access to advanced American semiconductors. The devices, the sources claim, can help build cases against individuals and companies that violate U.S. export rules.Location trackers have long been used by US law enforcement to monitor exports such as airplane parts. In recent years, they have been deployed to combat the illegal diversion of semiconductors.Super Micro said it does not disclose its “security practices and policies” and would not comment on tracking actions. Dell, on the other hand, said it was “not aware of a US Government initiative to place trackers in its product shipments.”US, a leader in the global AI chip supply chain, has recently tightened export controls on China from 2022 to limit its military development. Similar restrictions apply to Russia. Proposals in the White House and Congress have suggested requiring location verification technology in chips to prevent diversion.China has criticized the restrictions as an attempt to suppress its growth. Last month, its cyberspace regulator called in Nvidia to discuss concerns over alleged “backdoors” in its chips, a claim Nvidia has denied.Some Chinese resellers have reportedly said they inspect diverted shipments for trackers before delivery due to the risk of them being embedded. In a recent US Justice Department case, a co-conspirator told a defendant to “look carefully” for trackers on servers containing Nvidia chips.","US authorities are secretly placing location tracking devices in certain shipments of advanced chips from companies like Nvidia, Dell, AMD, Nvidia among others.

How and Why Trump's New Tariffs Will Not Make Your iPhone More Expensive

The Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales to China. US President Donald Trump confirmed this week that he negotiated the deal, which grants Nvidia and AMD export licenses for their China-specific AI chips in exchange for a percentage of their revenue. The White House also said that similar deals may be extended to other companies in the future.White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the arrangement currently applies to just the two chipmakers.“Right now it stands with these two companies. Perhaps it could expand in the future to other companies,” she said.Leavitt added that the “legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce,” suggesting that the implementation of the unprecedented deal is far from complete.The development comes days after it was reported that Trump told Nvidia and AMD that they need to pay 15% of the revenue to the government.""I said, 'If I'm going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I'm giving you a release',"" Trump stated.Nvidia, for its part, released a statement saying, ""We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.""The agreement has drawn criticism from trade lawyers and experts who have questioned its legality, citing existing laws that regulate how the government can charge fees for export licenses.The chips in question, including Nvidia's H20 and AMD's equivalents, are specifically designed to comply with US export regulations that were put in place in 2023 to limit China’s access to advanced AI technology. The U.S. government is concerned that these powerful chips could be used by China to advance its military capabilities.","US President Donald Trump confirmed this week that he negotiated the deal, which grants Nvidia and AMD export licenses for their China-specific AI chips.

What Intel said about laying off factory workers

Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro Review: Built for Real Work

Intel is set to begin laying off factory workers at its Silicon Forest campus in Oregon starting mid-July. The initial round of layoffs is expected to be completed by the end of the month. However, the chip-making company has indicated that further reductions may be implemented if deemed necessary. According to a report by Oregon Live, Intel informed its employees of this decision this week. An internal message sent to staff at Intel's production facilities outlined a restructuring within the Intel Foundry manufacturing group. This reorganisation aims to shift the group's focus more towards engineering and technical roles, implying a reduction in middle management positions.While specific figures for the number of affected employees have not been provided yet, the company's message suggests that the decision is official. Intel noted that these measures are a necessary step to enhance its financial position.In a statement sent to Tom’s Hardware, Intel wrote: “As we announced earlier this year, we are taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company. Removing organisational complexity and empowering our engineers will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers and strengthen our execution. We are making these decisions based on careful consideration of what is needed to position our business for the future, and we will treat people with care and respect as we complete this important work.”In December 2024, Intel’s employee headcount stood at 108,900, about 15,000 fewer than under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s cuts last year, the report notes. The company’s Oregon sites were no exception, which cut roughly 3,000 jobs but retained about 20,000 employees.Intel has not specified how many roles will be trimmed at Intel Foundry. However, staff in other divisions told Oregon Live that they anticipate similar cuts, with each unit free to implement layoffs independently as long as they meet their cost-reduction goals.Intel’s Oregon site hosts the company’s D1X and D1D fabs, which, despite heavy automation, depend on engineers, technicians, operators, analysts, and support staff. Critical roles like process engineers and high-skill technicians for EUV lithography are vital and may not be eliminated, the report adds.","Intel to begin laying off factory workers at its Silicon Forest campus in Oregon starting mid-July.

Taiwan Blacklists Chinese technology company that is designated as 'National Security Threat' by the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taiwan-blacklists-chinese-technology-company-that-us-has-designated-as-national-security-threat/articleshow/121853311.cms,"When America designated Huawei as 'National Security Threat'

Taiwan has blacklisted China's Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. According to a report in Bloomberg, Taiwan’s International Trade Administration has included Huawei, SMIC and several of their subsidiaries in an update of its so-called strategic high-tech commodities entity list, according to the latest version that was made available on its website on Saturday, June 14. This is said to deal a serious blow to the two companies spearheading China’s efforts to develop cutting-edge AI chip technologies. The change, which was not publicly announced, requires Taiwanese companies to obtain government approval before exporting to listed entities.Both the companies are also banned by the United States of America (USA). In June 2020 the America's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated two Chinese companies -- Huawei Technologies Company (Huawei) and ZTE Corporation (ZTE), as well as their parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries -- as covered companies for purposes of the agency’s November 2019 ban on the use of universal service support to purchase equipment or services from companies posing a national security threat. America has also placed SMIC and some of its subsidiaries on the US entity list, which has significantly limited the companies' ability to acquire foreign technology.Citing Taiwan’s regulations, the report noted that the new restrictions could significantly limit Huawei and SMIC’s access to Taiwan’s plant construction technologies, materials, and equipment critical for producing AI semiconductors, such as those manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) for companies like Nvidia. The updated list also includes Huawei’s units in Japan, Russia, and Germany.In 2023, Bloomberg News reported that several Taiwanese firms were assisting Huawei in developing a covert network of chip plants in southern China. This latest move by Taipei may disrupt those efforts, further constraining the Chinese companies’ semiconductor ambitions.The report highlighted that Taiwan had previously imposed blanket bans on exporting chipmaking equipment, such as lithography machines, to China but had not targeted specific Chinese tech firms on its entity list until now. TSMC, a key supplier for Apple and Nvidia, halted supplies to Huawei in 2020 due to U.S. export controls.Huawei and SMIC made headlines in 2023 by unveiling a 7-nanometer chip made in China, surprising U.S. policymakers. Despite global restrictions, the companies remain China’s best hope for bridging the AI chip gap left by limited access to Nvidia’s advanced semiconductors.The restrictions come amid escalating tensions, with Taiwan President Lai Ching-te earlier this year labeling China a “foreign hostile force” and introducing measures to counter infiltration, Bloomberg reported. China, which claims Taiwan as its territory and has threatened unification by force, has not yet responded to the new measures.","Taiwan has blacklisted China's Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.

While acknowledging job transformation, Huang emphasized AI's potential to create new opportunities and boost productivity.

What Anthropic CEO said on AI

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Amodei, in a recent Axios interview, had warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level office roles and urged policymakers to prepare for economic impacts. Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. “Some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,” he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. “Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers … so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks,” the statement read. The spokesperson reaffirmed Amodei’s concerns about AI’s economic impact and his commitment to addressing them.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by Amodei and other ex-OpenAI researchers, prioritizes safety in AI development, a focus rooted in the founders’ reported concerns over OpenAI’s direction. The public clash between Huang and Amodei highlights ongoing debates in the AI industry about its societal and economic implications.","Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris.

Oracle founder Larry Ellison has surpassed Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to claim the No. 2 spot on the world’s richest list, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Bezos had held the position for nearly eight years, with Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg briefly occupying it at times. Bloomberg notes that Ellison’s wealth surged by over $20 billion this week, fueled by a record-high Oracle Corp. stock price.Oracle’s shares jumped 13% to $199.85 at Thursday’s close in New York, marking the largest single-day gain in a year, after the company forecasted a 70% increase in cloud infrastructure sales for the fiscal year, Bloomberg reports. The software giant, traditionally known for its database products, is gaining ground in cloud computing, particularly for AI-focused clients. Oracle recently launched a joint venture called Stargate to supply OpenAI with significant computing power.“Oracle is on its way to becoming one of the world’s largest cloud infrastructure companies,” Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said in a statement Wednesday, as quoted by Bloomberg. She added that fiscal year 2026 revenue growth rates are expected to be “dramatically higher.”Bloomberg highlights Oracle’s $138 billion in remaining performance obligations, a key indicator of bookings, up from $130 billion the prior quarter. On an analyst call, Ellison described an unprecedented order: “We recently got an order that said we’ll take all the capacity you have, wherever it is… we never got an order like that before.”The AI boom has driven demand for data center capacity, with Oracle carving out a niche in AI-focused computing power, serving clients like Elon Musk’s xAI and Meta, Bloomberg reports. Analyst Brent Thill told Bloomberg TV that Catz’s long-term outlook, hinting at revenue acceleration, was the “exceptional” part of Oracle’s report, potentially driven by Stargate and OpenAI collaborations.To meet demand, Oracle’s capital expenditures tripled to $21.2 billion for the year ended May 31, with plans to rise to $25 billion this year, Bloomberg notes. Ellison explained, “The reason demand continues to outstrip supply is we can only build these data centers, build these computers, so fast.”","Larry Ellison has surpassed Amazon's Jeff Bezos to claim the No. 2 spot on the world's richest list.

Smuggling AI hardware

How and why China uses countries in Southeast Asia as base

In a bid to bypass stringent US restrictions on advanced AI chips, Chinese companies are resorting to innovative workarounds, including processing data abroad. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, in early March, four Chinese engineers traveled from Beijing to Malaysia, each carrying a suitcase with 15 hard drives containing 80 terabytes of data for training an AI model. At a Malaysian data center, the engineers utilized approximately 300 servers equipped with Nvidia’s advanced chips to develop the AI model, which they later brought back to China.Since 2022, the US has tightened export controls on high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. According to WSJ report, these restrictions have limited Chinese firms’ access to cutting-edge American technology, prompting them to explore alternatives. Some have substituted domestic chips for American ones, while others have smuggled AI hardware through third countries. However, increased US pressure has made smuggling more challenging, pushing Chinese companies to process data outside China in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East. “This was something we were consistently concerned about,” said Thea Kendler, former head of export controls at the Commerce Department under the Biden administration, referring to Chinese firms’ remote access to U.S. AI chips, told WSJ.The process involves layers of intermediaries, obscuring whether US regulations are being violated. The Biden administration proposed country-specific caps on American chip purchases to curb such activities, but the Trump administration scrapped these in May, citing unnecessary regulatory burdens on U.S. companies like Nvidia. Instead, it issued guidance urging firms to prevent their chips from being used to train Chinese AI models.In Malaysia, the Chinese company’s operation required meticulous planning. Engineers reportedly spent over eight weeks optimizing data sets in China, as transferring large data volumes online could take months. Last July, the company worked through a Singaporean subsidiary but later registered a Malaysian entity to avoid scrutiny after Nvidia and its vendors intensified end-user audits. To evade suspicion at Malaysian customs, the engineers distributed hard drives across four suitcases, a shift from bundling them into one the previous year. They returned to China with several hundred gigabytes of model parameters guiding the AI system’s output.Southeast Asia is reported to be emerging as a hub for such activities, with data centers rapidly expanding. Jones Lang LaSalle estimates nearly 2,000 megawatts of data-center capacity in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia -- matching Europe’s largest markets. Malaysia’s AI chip imports from Taiwan surged to $3.4 billion in March and April, exceeding its 2024 total. Meanwhile, the Middle East is also becoming a destination for Chinese AI developers, with Nvidia recently announcing significant chip sales to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE.These maneuvers highlight the challenges of enforcing US export controls as Chinese companies exploit global data centers to access American technology. While Southeast Asian authorities, like Singapore’s, are cracking down on transshipments, the region’s booming infrastructure continues to attract both Western and Chinese clients, testing the limits of regulatory oversight.","US has tightened export controls on high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns.

Verdict on July 2, what proscecutors want

Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment, with a French court hearing disturbing accounts from former employees, predominantly women, about a toxic workplace culture at the gaming giant’s Paris headquarters during the 2010s, according to The Guardian. The accusations, reportedly described as “extremely serious” by prosecutor Antoine Haushalter, include incidents of employees being tied to chairs, forced to perform handstands, subjected to sexual jokes, exposed to pornographic videos in the office, and enduring crude behavior, such as a boss farting in employees’ faces. One woman reported a manager drawing a penis on her arm during a video call with senior leaders. The court case marks the gaming industry’s first major #MeToo trial.The accused include Tommy Francois, 52, former Vice President of Editorial & Creative Services; Serge Hascoet, 59, former Chief Creative Officer; and Guillaume Patrux, 41, former Game Director. Ubisoft, known for blockbuster titles like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Just Dance, was allegedly a “Boys’ Club” where such misconduct thrived, per The Guardian.Francois faces charges of sexual harassment, bullying, and attempted sexual assault. The Guardian reported that he allegedly tied a female employee to a chair before sending her in an elevator to a random floor and forced a woman in a skirt to do handstands, leaving her terrified. At a 2015 office party, he reportedly attempted to kiss a woman while others restrained her; she escaped after shouting. Another woman accused Francois of grabbing her hair and attempting a forced kiss at a U.S. gaming event, showing her nude photos, and drawing on her arm during a video call. Ubisoft’s HR allegedly dismissed her concerns, advising her not to escalate. Francois denies all allegations.Hascoet is accused of bullying and sexual harassment, including making inappropriate sexual comments, such as telling a woman on a work trip she “needed sex” in front of colleagues, and joking that a used tissue he handed to a female employee was “worth gold at Ubisoft,” per The Guardian. He allegedly made sexual noises, forced assistants to run personal errands, and denies any intent to harass.Patrux faces similar charges, accused of punching walls, pretending to strike employees, cracking a whip near faces, joking about an office shooting, and burning an employee’s beard with a lighter, according to The Guardian. He also denies the allegations.Haushalter called the trial an important moment for the gaming industry, highlighted by the #MeToo movement, which empowered victims to speak out. He also highlighted “strong proof” of systemic mistreatment and requested suspended prison sentences of up to three years and fines for the trio. The court concluded hearings, with a verdict expected on July 2, 2025.","Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment.

Bill Gates spent $38 million on equestrian real estate for daughter Jennifer

In 2016, he bought a neighboring 4.5-acre estate for $13.5 million.

He then snapped up two vacant lots for around $5 million.

Another 5.2-acre compound with barns and residential buildings was acquired for $8.7 million.

Finally, a 1.3-acre plot was purchased for $2.5 million to complete the puzzle.

The Bill Gates’ approach to parenting

“We absolutely did not just buy them things. It was much more of an upbringing like I grew up in. A very middle-class household where money did dictate whether I got an extra pair of shoes that year or not.”

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which was once commonly linked to war veterans, has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence throughout all demographics and occupations. The most recent public reference to it is by Errol Musk, who explained his son Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump as stemming fromAlthough those claims tend to fuel controversy, they also point to the larger, more serious discourse surrounding mental health, particularly in high-pressure settings such as politics, governance, or technology entrepreneurship.PTSD is a stress disorder that can happen to anyone who has witnessed or experienced a traumatic experience. From victims of natural disasters and violent offenses to those subjected to chronic emotional stress, PTSD can drastically interfere with daily life and quality of life if not treated. Here's a comprehensive overview of PTSD, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and contemporary treatment methods.PTSD stands forr, a mental health condition that may occur following exposure to or witnessing a traumatic event.It is accepted within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and may occur in individuals of all ages, including children.PTSD is different from the temporary emotional distress that most individuals experience following trauma. Although many recover on their own, those with PTSD remain affected by long-lasting symptoms that can last for months or even years and disrupt their normal functioning.PTSD may result from a variety of traumatic events. While some individuals develop the disorder following a one-time event, others become affected after repeated exposure to stressful situations. They are commonly triggered by:It is worth noting that not everyone who is exposed to trauma will develop PTSD. Genetics, brain chemistry, coping methods, and support systems can all play a role in a person's risk.PTSD symptoms typically start within three months of the traumatic event but at other times may emerge later. To be considered for PTSD diagnosis, the symptoms should persist for more than a month and lead to major distress or impairments in social or occupational functioning.PTSD symptoms are typically classified into four clusters:Although PTSD may occur in anyone, some individuals are at higher risk:Studies also indicate that women are more likely than men to experience PTSD, perhaps because of higher incidence rates of interpersonal violence.PTSD is usually diagnosed by a mental health professional, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker, based on criteria from the DSM-5. The diagnostic process involves:At other times, symptom quantification is achieved through the use of standardized measurement tools such as the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5).Contemporary treatment of PTSD aims to enable people to manage symptoms, re-establish trust, and take back control of their lives.

"Meta, TikTok challenge EU’s Big Tech fee; call it “unfair and disproportionate”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-tiktok-challenge-eus-big-tech-fee-call-it-unfair-and-disproportionate/articleshow/121796298.cms,"What Meta and TikTok said about Europe’s DSA

What the European Commission argue

Xiaomi QLED TV FX Pro 55-inch Review: Affordable Cinematic Experience at Home

Meta and TikTok have taken the European Union to court over a fee which they claim is unfair and based on flawed calculations. Speaking before Europe’s second-highest court on Wednesday, the two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency. The law, which came into effect in 2022, requires 19 large online platforms to pay a fee—up to 0.05% of their annual global net income—to help fund the European Commission's work overseeing their compliance with digital rules.Stating that the company is not trying to avoid paying the fees, Meta’s lawyer questioned the Commission’s method for calculating the fee. In a General Court in Luxembourg, he said it was wrongly based on the overall group’s revenue, not the revenue of the EU-based subsidiary, and that the company still doesn’t know exactly how the final amount was reached.TikTok’s lawyer echoed similar concerns, calling the fee “unfair and disproportionate.” He said the method used inflated TikTok’s payment and even required the company to help cover the cost for other platforms. He also accused the EU of counting the same user more than once if they switch between devices, which he said led to double-counting.Both companies argued that the Commission went beyond its legal powers by using group-level profits to calculate the cap for the fee.In response, the European Commission’s lawyer defended the system, saying that when a company files consolidated financial reports, it’s reasonable to use group-level financial data. She also said that companies had access to enough information to understand how the fee was determined and that there was no violation of their rights.","The two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

What else does Donald Trump’s financial filing reveal about his investments



US President Donald Trump has reported making $57.35 million from his family’s cryptocurrency ventures, a report claims. These figures were reportedly revealed as part of his first public financial disclosure report of this term. As per the report, the US President included income from token sales at crypto firm World Liberty Financial and reported holding 15.75 billion governance tokens in the same venture. The financial disclosure did not specify the exact period it covered. However, details within the cryptocurrency listings and other information in the disclosure suggest the report covers data through the end of December 2024. This timeframe would exclude the majority of funds raised by the Trump family’s cryptocurrency ventures during his current term.Earlier this year, the president introduced a meme coin called $TRUMP, which has since generated about $320 million in fees, the news agency Reuters reports. However, Reuters didn’t clarify how those earnings are divided between a Trump-controlled entity and its partners remains unclear.On top of those meme coin revenues, the Trump family has pulled in over $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm, Reuters noted. The Trump family is also involved in a bitcoin mining operation and several cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds , the report added.The latest filing also showed that much of the President’s wealth was tied to his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that owns the social media platform Truth Social. As per Reuters calculations, he reported at least $12 million in passive income which includes interest and dividends from investments worth $211 million, notably in Blue Owl Capital and bond funds managed by Charles Schwab and Invesco.Trump’s Florida properties which include three golf resorts and Mar-a-Lago also generated at least $217.7 million in revenue, led by Trump National Doral’s $110.4 million. International income included $5 million in Vietnam licensing fees, $10 million from India development, and $16 million from Dubai licensing.He also earned royalties of $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible, $2.8 million from watches, $2.5 million from sneakers and fragrances and $1.16 million from NFTs, while US First Lady Melania Trump made $216,700 from her NFT collection.","US President Donald Trump reported making $57.35 million from his family’s cryptocurrency ventures, a report claims.

What it may mean for Scale AI



Google, the largest customer of AI data-labeling firm Scale AI, plans to end its relationship with the company following news that rival Facebook-parent company Meta is acquiring a 49% stake, a report said. Google had reportedly intended to pay Scale AI around $200 million this year for human-labeled training data, essential for developing advanced AI models like its ChatGPT competitor, Gemini.Citing five sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters reported that the move stems from concerns that Meta's significant investment could expose Google's proprietary AI research and roadmap to a key competitor. Reportedly, the search giant has already begun discussions with several of Scale AI's rivals this week, looking to shift this substantial workload.Not only Google, The unease isn't limited to Google. Other major tech companies using Scale AI's services, including Microsoft and Elon Musk's xAI, are also reportedly distancing themselves.The report also says that OpenAI, another significant AI developer, had already scaled back its engagement with Scale AI months ago, though its spending was considerably less than Google's. However, OpenAI's CFO recently stated that the company would continue working with Scale AI as one of its many data vendors.The primary concern among companies competing with Meta in cutting-edge AI model development is the risk of their research priorities and technical blueprints being exposed to a direct rival. Customers often share proprietary data and even prototype products with Scale AI's workers for data-labeling services.With Meta now holding a substantial stake, these AI firms fear their chief competitor could gain sensitive business and technical intelligence.For Scale AI, this potential loss of Google's business comes as a blow, despite its recent valuation jump to $29 billion following Meta's investment (up from $14 billion pre-deal). Scale AI's core business heavily relies on a few major customers, making it vulnerable to such departures. While Scale AI intends to continue operations, its CEO, Alexandr Wang, along with some employees, are moving to Meta.The bulk of Scale AI's revenue comes from providing human trainers to annotate complex datasets for generative AI model makers, a service that can cost as much as $100 per annotation for sophisticated examples. Its largest revenue stream is from its partnerships with generative AI model makers.",Report: Google plans to end relationship with AI data-labeling firm Scale AI.

Paytm 1.3 billion transactions worth Rs 1.38 lakh crore Navi 386 million transactions worth Rs 21,350 crore super.money 203 million transactions worth Rs 7,054 crore

PhonePe and Google Pay maintained their dominance in the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) ecosystem in May, capturing significant market shares in both transaction volume and value, as per data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), as reported by Economic Times. PhonePe, gearing up for a listing on the Indian stock market, reportedly captured nearly half the UPI market last month, processing Rs 12.56 lakh crore across 8.7 billion transactions, representing 50% of the total UPI value and 47% of the volume.Google Pay, the second-largest UPI platform, handled 6.7 billion transactions worth Rs 8.85 lakh crore, accounting for 37% of the volume and over 35% of the value in May, per NPCI data cited by the Economic Times. Paytm , operated by One97 Communications, trailed in third with 1.27 billion transactions valued at Rs 1.38 lakh crore, holding 7% of the volume and 5.55% of the value. Navi , owned by Sachin Bansal, and Flipkart’s super.money ranked as the fourth and fifth largest UPI apps, respectively, the report noted.According to a report last month, PhonePe derives 95% of its revenue from digital payments , with UPI being central to its business. Merchant payment firms like Pine Labs, preparing for an IPO, and Razorpay, eyeing a 2026 public listing, also rely heavily on UPI transactions.UPI processed 18.68 billion transactions in May, up 4.4% from April’s decline, totaling Rs 25.14 lakh crore in value, compared to Rs 23.95 lakh crore in April, according to NPCI data. The platform has seen rapid growth since its 2016 launch, though its expansion is slowing. However, experts say the slow down in growth is coming as UPI expansion is reaching near saturation.UPI platforms faced monetization challenges after hopes of reinstating the merchant discount rate (MDR) were dashed by the finance ministry recently, impacting listed payment firms. The Ministry of Finance has clarified that there was no plan to reintroduce the merchant discount rate (MDR) on payments done via UPI.","UPI processed 18.68 billion transactions in May, up 4.4% from April’s decline, totaling Rs 25.14 lakh crore.

Elon Musk's Neuralink may be using monkeys to give humans ‘superpowers’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-neuralink-may-be-using-monkeys-to-give-humans-superpowers/articleshow/121838358.cms,"How Neuralink’s Blindsight device can help its users



Elon Musk-owned Neuralink is reportedly testing brain implants in monkeys that can eventually give humans ""superpowers,"" including capabilities beyond normal vision. While the device’s initial goal may be to restore vision in visually impaired patients, the company's long-term objective for its Blindsight device includes enabling "" superhuman capabilities "" such as infrared sight, the tech billionaire predicted in March. Now, a company engineer has revealed that its tests using brain implants in monkeys has enable one of primate to see something which is not physically present. At a recent conference, Neuralink engineer Joseph O’Doherty announced that the device, Blindsight, stimulated vision-linked brain areas in a monkey. During tests, the monkey moved its eyes toward what researchers wanted to make the monkey’s brain to visualise at least two-thirds of the time.According to a report by Bloomberg, these findings are Neuralink’s first public disclosures regarding test progress with Blindsight. Earlier this year, Musk confirmed that Blindsight has been tested in monkeys for several years, with human trials planned for later this year.This area of research represents a closely observed frontier in brain device development, exploring how technology may treat challenging medical conditions. However, it's important to note that the device is not yet approved for human use in the US, and it remains to be determined how the findings from animal studies would translate to humans.Neuralink executive O’Doherty added that the company eventually intends to pair the implanted chip with specialised glasses to help display the enhanced visual data. Testing in monkeys offers practical advantages, since a monkey’s visual cortex lies nearer the brain’s surface. For human applications, Neuralink plans to use its surgical robot to insert the implant into deeper cortical regions.Musk sees these medical achievements as steps toward speeding up human communication and “mitigating the risk of digital super-intelligence,” a vision he outlined in 2024. Apart from this device, his work on brain–machine interfaces is also running alongside AI development at xAI Corp.","Elon Musk-owned Neuralink is reportedly testing brain implants in monkeys that can eventually give humans ""superpowers,"" including capabilities beyond normal vision.

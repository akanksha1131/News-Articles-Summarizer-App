US President Donald Trump is not happy with the UK government 's demand to Apple to provide a technical “back door” to access user data. In a recent interview with UK-based magazine 'The Spectator', the US President Donald Trump criticized the UK government's request for Apple to grant access to certain user data, comparing it to practices commonly associated with China.He conveyed this sentiment to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during their meeting at the White House earlier this week, where they also discussed topics like Ukraine and a bilateral trade agreement.Donald Trump likened the UK government's demand that Apple, opens new tab grant it access to some user data as ""something that you hear about with China"". Trump reportedly said that he had told British Prime Minister Starmer that he ""can't do this"", referring to the request for access to data. ""We actually told him (Starmer) ... that's incredible. That's something, you know, that you hear about with China,"" Trump said in his first magazine interview.Additionally, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard indicated that America is investigating whether the UK's actions violate the CLOUD Act , which restricts cross-border data access demands. In a letter to British lawmakers, she wrote that the UK government’s order for Apple to create a “backdoor” to iCloud users’ accounts is a “clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties”.“Any information sharing between a government – any government – and private companies must be done in a manner that respects and protects the U.S. law and the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens,” Gabbard wrote.Apple removes encryption for UK users, says left with no choiceIn response to the UK's demands, Apple recently discontinued its Advanced Data Protection feature for iCloud users in the UK. Apple removed its encryption feature altogether. The company said it had been given no choice and that it was disappointed at being forced to eliminate Advanced Data Protection. Apple has made a point of publicly fighting back against government requests for user data.","US President Donald Trump is not happy with the UK government's demand to Apple to provide a technical “back door” to access user data.

How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizen



Can petition really revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship



Revoke Elon Musk's Canadian Citizenship. So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. Elon Musk is one of the closest associates of the US President Donald Trump, who plans to levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports next month. Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many.The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus , a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I’m ngl this Canadian ’51st state’ s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%”.Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship. He has previously said that he obtained a Canadian passport as a teenager through his mother, Maye Musk, who was born in Canada. Musk received US citizenship a decade after arriving in the US on a student visa.No, very unlikely. It is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. The petition to revoke Musk’s citizenship is open until June 20, 2025. Post this, the petitions will have to certify that at least 500 of its signatures are legitimate. From there, the petition must wait until a new session of parliament opens before it can be presented to the House of Commons for debate.Under Canadian government rules, citizenship may be revoked if a person commits fraud, misrepresents themselves, or deliberately conceals information on an immigration or citizenship application.","Petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport.

Following an inquiry into allegations of labour law violations , the department concluded that the company had not breached any legal requirements, as the affected individuals were classified as trainees rather than employees.“We have not found any violation of labour laws in our inspection at Infosys…There was no employee and employer relationship between them in the first place. They were not even given appointment letters for them to be called employees. They were trainees for three months who were paid stipends and were part of the apprenticeship program,” confirmed a government official.The investigation was prompted by complaints from the Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate ( NITES ) and affected trainees, who claimed the layoffs were unethical and violated labour laws. Infosys had terminated approximately 350-400 trainees on February 7, citing their inability to clear internal assessments after three attempts. The company emphasised that performance evaluations are a standard part of its globally recognised training program.In its interim report, the Karnataka Labour Department clarified that the state government cannot intervene in the selection or evaluation processes of private companies. The department also noted that Infosys had adhered to its policies by providing outplacement services, severance pay , and counselling to the trainees who were let go.Labour Minister Santhosh Lad ordered an inspection of Infosys campuses in Mysuru and Bengaluru, conducted by a team led by G Manjunath. The review of hiring documents revealed that while more than 600 students from the 2022 batch moved forward, 329 failed a required test. Government officials also raised concerns about Infosys's terminology.Despite the clean chit, NITES has expressed dissatisfaction with the findings and warned of potential protests. The union continues to advocate for stronger protections for trainees and employees in the IT sector, calling for greater transparency and fairness in hiring and evaluation practices.","The Karnataka Labour Department has officially given Infosys a clean chit regarding the recent layoffs of trainees at its Mysuru campus.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities.

Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Concerns over branding and product differentiation

Investment offers and final deal

The latest episode of Shark Tank India Season 4 witnessed one of the most intense and high-pressure pitches of the season. A team of founders from Delhi, representing their cushion brand Trajectory, entered the tank seeking Rs 1 crore for 2% equity, valuing their company at Rs 50 crore. However, their presentation quickly turned into a heated exchange when Anupam Mittal launched into a relentless critique, questioning the viability of their business in a highly competitive market.Despite the intense grilling, the founders managed to impress some of the sharks with their strong financials, projected revenue of Rs 15 crore, and an EBITDA margin of 21%. Their distribution strategy, which included sales on Amazon and airport retail outlets, along with a marketing spend of under 5%, drew interest from certain sharks. However, concerns regarding branding, trust, and differentiation cast doubts on their overall business model.From the moment the pitch began, Anupam Mittal made his skepticism clear, expressing doubt about their entry into a highly commoditized industry flooded with cheaper alternatives. He bluntly questioned their decision to operate in such a competitive space, setting the tone for a tough interrogation.As one of the founders, Raghav, attempted to narrate the brand’s origin story, Anupam cut him off mid-sentence, dismissing it as unnecessary. A rehearsed joke from Raghav backfired, prompting further criticism. Even Peyush Bansal, who showed some interest, advised them to abandon their scripted approach and communicate naturally.The tension escalated when Namita Thapar questioned what differentiated their cushions from competitors. As the founders began explaining the fabric and material, Anupam lost patience once again, accusing them of beating around the bush rather than providing direct answers.Adding to their troubles, Ritesh Agarwal pointed out that their logo closely resembled Tesla’s, raising concerns about originality and branding. This observation prompted sarcastic reactions from Anupam and Aman Gupta, further intensifying the scrutiny. Brand trust and identity became key issues, leading some sharks to believe that the business lacked a clear and distinct positioning in the market.Despite the intense questioning, Trajectory’s financial performance kept Ritesh Agarwal and Peyush Bansal interested. However, Anupam, Namita, and Aman eventually backed out, citing issues related to branding, trust, and lack of differentiation.After a series of negotiations, the founders accepted Ritesh Agarwal’s offer of Rs 50 lakh for 3% equity, along with Rs 50 lakh in debt at an 8% interest rate. The deal came with specific scaling conditions, which the founders agreed to, securing Ritesh as their sole investor.","The latest episode of Shark Tank India Season 4 witnessed one of the most intense and high-pressure pitches of the season.

"Apple logo mystery solved: Designer Rob Janoff makes it clear logo has nothing to do with byte, Adam and Eve's forbidden fruit or Newton's gravity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-logo-mystery-solved-designer-rob-janoff-makes-it-clear-logo-has-nothing-to-do-with-byte-adam-and-eves-forbidden-fruit-or-newtons-gravity/articleshow/118634657.cms,"Apple logo 'Byte' theory debunked by Rob Janoff

“They are really interesting, but I’m afraid it didn’t have a thing to do with it,” Janoff said. “Somebody starts it, and then people go, ‘Oh yeah, that must be it.’ But it’s all BS.”

The story behind Apple's logo

Why Apple's logo has a bite: The real reason revealed

“It was initially meant to indicate that it was an apple, and not something else,”

“Metaphorically, the bite indicated biting into all the knowledge users would get out of this computer.”

Apple logo’s ‘Byte’ myth: The accidental wordplay that stuck

“I wasn’t computer literate enough to see that initially,”

“But I was like, there’s a bit of wit that will last!”

Apple logo’s timeless appeal: Simplicity, evolution, and a lasting legacy

“People can’t remember complicated things. They can remember simple things,”

The Apple logo , one of the most recognisable symbols in the world, has been surrounded by speculation and myths for decades. The logo’s distinct bite mark has fueled theories ranging from biblical references to technological puns. Many have linked it to the story of Adam and Eve’s forbidden fruit, while others suggest it was inspired by Isaac Newton’s discovery of gravity. Perhaps the most famous theory is that the missing chunk represents a play on the word “byte,” a unit of digital data in computing.However, Rob Janoff , the graphic designer behind the logo, has finally set the record straight. In a recent interview, he dismissed these long-standing rumors, revealing that the true reason behind the design choice is far simpler than many had imagined. His explanation sheds light on Apple’s early branding strategy and highlights the role of simplicity in creating a lasting brand identity.For years, tech enthusiasts and Apple fans have insisted that the Apple logo's bite mark was a clever nod to computing terminology. The theory gained traction across social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok, with users praising the design as a subtle yet brilliant reference to digital technology.However, in an interview with Creative Bits, Janoff debunked the claim, calling it nothing more than an urban legend.Despite the widespread belief in the “byte” theory, Janoff clarified that the bite was added for a much simpler reason—to ensure that the fruit was instantly recognizable as an apple rather than any other round fruit like a cherry or peach.The Apple logo was created in 1977 when Janoff was working for the advertising agency Regis McKenna, which was responsible for Apple's branding during its early years. At the time, Apple was still a small company, and its founders, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, were looking for a logo that would represent their vision of computing in a way that was both innovative and user-friendly.Janoff was given little direction for the design, apart from Jobs’ insistence that the logo should not be “cute.” Taking creative liberty, Janoff decided to use a simple apple silhouette, which combined a natural, organic image with the futuristic vision of computers.The decision to add a bite mark to the apple was purely practical. Janoff wanted to make sure that the fruit would be instantly identifiable as an apple, as opposed to a cherry, peach, or any other round fruit.Janoff explained in an interview with Forbes.Though this explanation is far less mysterious than the byte-bite theory, it highlights the importance of clarity in design. By ensuring that the apple was easily recognizable, Janoff created a logo that would become one of the most iconic symbols in corporate history.Interestingly, while Janoff never intended the bite to be a reference to computing, the pun was noticed shortly after the logo's creation. His creative director, Chip, was the first to point out the connection between “bite” and “byte.”Janoff admitted.Even though the connection was unintentional, the wordplay became an enduring part of Apple’s brand identity. Over time, the idea that the logo was a clever technological reference became so widely accepted that many assumed it had been the original intent.The original Apple logo featured a rainbow-striped apple, which was introduced to highlight Apple's groundbreaking color display technology. As the company grew, the logo underwent several changes, transitioning to monochrome and sleeker designs in line with Apple's minimalist aesthetic.Despite these updates, the core design has remained unchanged, proving the strength of Janoff’s original vision. He believes the simplicity of the Apple logo is what makes it so memorable and effective.Janoff stated.He also emphasised that adding a subtle “wink” or a hint of humor to a design makes it more relatable and likable. This philosophy has helped the Apple logo stand the test of time, maintaining its status as one of the most recognizable logos in the world.","Rob Janoff, the graphic designer behind the Apple logo, has debunked the 'byte' theory.

AMD has officially announced the release of its latest graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, set to ship on March 6, 2025. As per reports, these new GPUs are strategically priced at $549 and $599, respectively, positioning them as direct competitors to NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti. AMD aims to deliver high-end 4K gaming experiences at more accessible price points, challenging NVIDIA's dominance in the GPU market. This move is expected to intensify competition and provide consumers with more options in the high-performance graphics segment.Contrary to earlier leaks suggesting higher prices, AMD has set the MSRP for the RX 9070 at $549 and the RX 9070 XT at $599, as reported. This pricing strategy is designed to undercut NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti, which is priced at $749, and match the RTX 5070 at $549. The Radeon RX 9070 series will be available starting March 6, 2025, with AMD emphasizing strong availability at launch to meet anticipated demand.AMD claims significant performance improvements with the new RX 9070 series. The RX 9070 XT is reported to be 51% faster on average than the four-year-old RX 6900 XT at 4K and maximum settings. Additionally, it is said to outperform NVIDIA's RTX 3090 by 26% under the same conditions. The standard RX 9070 also shows notable gains, being 21% faster than the RX 7900 GRE at 4K. Both cards are equipped with 16GB of GDDR6 memory, supporting high-resolution textures and future-proofing for upcoming game titles.Built on a 4nm monolithic chip, the RX 9070 series introduces the RDNA 4 architecture, which offers double the rasterization performance per compute unit compared to RDNA 2. The RX 9070 XT features 64 graphics compute units, while the RX 9070 includes 55. Both models support DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b interfaces and utilize standard 8-pin PCIe power connectors, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of systems.The new GPUs come with AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4, an AI-driven upscaling technology designed to boost frame rates while maintaining image quality comparable to native 4K rendering. AMD plans to have 30 FSR 4-supported games at launch, expanding to over 75 by the end of the year. The RX 9070 series also includes an enhanced media engine for improved gameplay recording and streaming, addressing previous concerns about recording quality.AMD's aggressive pricing and performance claims for the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are poised to challenge NVIDIA's position in the GPU market. By offering high-end performance at more accessible prices, AMD aims to attract gamers and professionals seeking cost-effective solutions without compromising on quality. The upcoming release is expected to intensify competition, potentially leading to more options and better pricing for consumers in the high-performance graphics card market.In addition to the RX 9070 series, AMD has teased the forthcoming RX 9060 series, expected to launch in the second quarter of 2025.

Microsoft uncovers global hacking ring that used AI for harmful content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-uncovers-global-hacking-ring-that-used-ai-for-harmful-content/articleshow/118631408.cms,"Why this is dangerous

Microsoft has said that it has discovered a global cybercrime network that bypassed safety measures on its generative AI tools, including Azure OpenAI, to produce illicit content, such as non-consensual intimate images.According to a report by Bloomberg, the tech giant identified hackers based in multiple countries – from Iran, the UK, Hong Kong, and Vietnam – who leveraged stolen customer login credentials to gain unauthorised access to its AI services.The hackers – who are allegedly part of a global cybercrime network that Microsoft calls Storm-2139 – reportedly manipulated the capabilities of these AI platforms and sold access to other malicious groups, providing detailed instructions for generating harmful content.Microsoft has also identified two individuals in Florida and Illinois, but withheld their names to avoid compromising ongoing criminal investigations.“We take the misuse of AI very seriously, recognizing the serious and lasting impacts of abusive imagery for victims. Microsoft remains committed to protecting users by embedding robust AI guardrails and safeguarding our services from illegal and harmful content,” stated Steven Masada, assistant general counsel of Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, in a blog post.This revelation underscores growing concerns about the potential misuse of generative AI to create fake, explicit images of both public figures and private individuals, as well as the production of child sexual abuse material. Despite safeguards implemented by companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, determined actors continue to seek ways to exploit these technologies.Microsoft's investigation followed a lawsuit filed in December against ten unidentified individuals in the Eastern District of Virginia, aimed at gathering information and disrupting the hacking group's operations.“As we’ve said before, no disruption is complete in one day. Going after malicious actors requires persistence and ongoing vigilance. By unmasking these individuals and shining a light on their malicious activities, Microsoft aims to set a precedent in the fight against AI technology misuse,” Masada added.","Microsoft says it has discovered a global cybercrime network that bypassed safety measures on its generative AI tools.

Skype Shut Down: Microsoft to ‘sign out’ of 20-year-old internet calling service Skype in May,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-may-sign-out-of-skype-video-calling-app-in-may/articleshow/118630224.cms,"Update:

Microsoft

confirms shutting down

Skype

to focus on its Teams service

What Microsoft said about shutting down Skype



""Skype has been an integral part of shaping modern communications. We are honored to have been part of the journey,”

Microsoft has confirmed that it is set to shut down Skype, the two-decade-old internet calling service, on May 5. The company is retiring the platform and encouraging users to migrate to Microsoft Teams. To facilitate the transition, Skype users will be able to access Teams for free on any compatible device using their current Skype login credentials. Chats and contacts will be automatically transferred to the new platform. However, Microsoft has not yet disclosed the number of users or employees that will be affected by this change.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, the company said that discontinuing Skype will streamline its communications and enable a sharper focus on its own Teams service.Microsoft said.This move was first spotted by XDA Developers after a message was discovered within the latest version of Skype for Windows preview confirms the upcoming retirement. The message in the codes of the app states that ""Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams.""While many may have anticipated Skype's eventual demise years ago, it continued to receive updates. The decline was partly due to Skype’s underlying technology not being built for the smartphone era, the report added.Founded in 2003, Skype introduced affordable audio and video calls that changed the traditional landline industry, eventually attracting millions of users. In recent years, however, the platform has struggled to compete with rivals such as Zoom and Salesforce's Slack.During the pandemic, as remote work increased and the need for online business calls grew, Microsoft shifted its focus to Teams by integrating it with its Office suite, aiming to serve the corporate market that had previously relied on Skype.Skype is now part of a series of Microsoft projects that have not met expectations, alongside Internet Explorer and Windows Phone. Other tech companies have also faced challenges with online communication tools, with Google making several attempts through apps like Hangouts and Duo.When Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion, outbidding Google and Facebook, the service had around 150 million monthly users. By 2020, that number had declined to roughly 23 million, even with a brief increase during the pandemic.",Microsoft confirmed that it is set to shut down Skype on May 5.

CEO Sundar Pichai highlights forthcoming technological advancements.

Sundar Pichai bets big on Waymo

Finally, a few words on Waymo which made tremendous progress last year, safely serving more than 4 million passenger trips. It is now averaging over 150,000 trips each week, and growing.

Looking ahead, Waymo will be expanding its network and operations partnerships to open up new markets, including Austin and Atlanta this year and Miami next year. And in the coming weeks, Waymo One vehicles will arrive in Tokyo for their first international road trip.

We’re also developing the sixth-generation Waymo Driver, which will significantly lower hardware costs.

Google-parent company Alphabet 's Waymo is experiencing rapid growth in its robotaxi service. CEO Sundar Pichai revealed on X that the company now provides over 200,000 paid rides weekly, a significant leap from 10,000 rides just two years ago and a doubling from 100,000 in August, prompting a reply from Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas .“Exciting new @Waymo milestone: Waymo One is now serving 200k+ paid trips each week across LA, Phoenix and SF - that’s 20x growth in less than two years!

Further expansion is planned, with commercial services launching in Austin and Atlanta in partnership with Uber in 2025, and Miami in early 2026.In a reply to Pichai’s post, Srinivas made a request to streamline music listening experience in the self-driving taxi.“Would be great if you made it easier to play your own songs or playlists while on a Waymo. The current integration to play YT Music isn’t quite good,” he said.In his remarks during the 2024 Q4 earnings call, Pichai shared the company’s momentum and innovation.

Ex-insider says CEO has mentally left the company

“Elon Musk is particularly good at two things: exploiting people and situations to his own advantage, and then committing 100 percent to what he believes in,”

“But Tesla is no longer what he believes in.”

Tesla faces challenges in the Nordic market

The Musk effect: How his persona impacts Tesla sales

Controversial design choices: ""Maybe We Took Away Too Much""

Elon Musk, the visionary behind Tesla , SpaceX, and multiple other ventures, is facing accusations that he has lost interest in Tesla, the company that revolutionized the electric vehicle (EV) market. These claims come from Esben Pedersen, Tesla’s former communications manager for Denmark and Norway, who worked closely with Musk for years. Pedersen asserts that Musk is no longer invested in Tesla’s future, shifting his focus to other ventures such as SpaceX, Neuralink, and his social media platform, X.Musk's alleged disengagement comes at a critical time for Tesla, as the company faces mounting challenges, including labor disputes, declining market dominance, and controversial design decisions. Despite Tesla's continued success in some regions, Pedersen and other industry insiders suggest that Musk's waning interest could have serious implications for the company’s future.According to Pedersen, Musk has a pattern of fully dedicating himself to projects he believes in—while leaving behind those that no longer align with his interests. He argues that Tesla may now fall into the latter category.Pedersen told Motor magazine.Pedersen, who had over 20 in-person meetings with Musk during his eight-year tenure at Tesla, claims that the billionaire is now more focused on ventures like SpaceX’s Mars colonization efforts, Neuralink’s brain-computer interface development, and his controversial acquisition of X (formerly Twitter).This shift in priorities has raised concerns among investors and industry experts, as Musk has been a key driver behind Tesla’s innovation, growth, and branding. Without his full attention, some fear Tesla could struggle to maintain its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market.Pedersen’s claims come amid Tesla’s ongoing struggles in the Nordic region. In Sweden, the company has been facing a major labor dispute, with union-led blockades preventing Tesla from registering new license plates and expanding its Supercharger network.Musk has long opposed labor unions, referring to them as divisive and likening them to a system of ""masters and subjects."" His anti-union stance has led to tensions between Tesla and European labor organizations, further complicating the company’s expansion efforts.Despite these obstacles, Tesla's sales in the Nordic region remain relatively strong, although the brand’s dominance has waned. In Denmark, the Tesla Model Y remains the sixth most popular vehicle overall, regardless of fuel type. However, Tesla as a brand has dropped out of the top 10 in national car sales rankings—a sign that its market influence may be declining.While some consumers have distanced themselves from Tesla due to Musk’s polarizing political affiliations, others continue to support the company because of their admiration for its CEO.A survey conducted by Automobilwoche found that one in five Tesla buyers cited Musk’s personality, actions, and public image as a key reason for their purchase. This suggests that Musk’s involvement—or lack thereof—could have a direct impact on Tesla’s brand loyalty and customer base.His increasing engagement with conservative political figures, including former President Donald Trump, has further divided public opinion. While some Tesla customers appreciate Musk’s outspoken stance on political and social issues, others are reconsidering their association with the brand.Tesla’s recent design decisions have also sparked debate, with some questioning whether the company’s push for minimalism has gone too far.Lars Moravy, Tesla’s Technical Director, recently acknowledged this issue during an appearance on Jay Leno’s Garage. He specifically pointed to Tesla’s controversial removal of turn signal stalks in 2023, a move that forced drivers to rely on touchscreen controls for basic functions.“At Tesla, we have always said that if you don’t take away so much that you have to put something back, you haven’t taken away enough,” Moravy stated. “Well… maybe we took away too much.”This admission suggests that Tesla may be re-evaluating some of its more radical design choices, particularly as consumer feedback continues to highlight usability concerns.","Elon Musk is facing accusations that he has lost interest in Tesla, the company that revolutionized the electric vehicle (EV) market.

Indian stock markets witnessed a sharp and sustained downturn in February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower, translating to a 5% loss for the month. This dramatic decline has resulted in a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalization of BSE-listed companies in just one month. The Nifty 50 also suffered a significant blow, recording its fifth consecutive month of losses, marking its longest losing streak since its inception in 1996. This relentless downward trend has sparked concerns among investors about the overall health of the Indian market.Talking about Blood Bath in the stock market on Twitter, Zerodha Founder and CEO Nithin Kamath wrote, ""The markets are finally correcting. Given that markets swing between extremes, they can fall more just like they rose to the peak. I've no idea where the markets go from here, but I can tell you about the broking industry. We are seeing a massive drop in terms of both the number of traders and volumes. Here is the trading volume chart. Across brokers, there's a more than 30% drop in activity. Combined with the true-to-market circular, we are seeing degrowth in the business for the first time since we started 15 years ago. This drying up of volumes shows how shallow the Indian markets still are. The activity is more or less among those 1-2 crore Indians. By the way, if this continues, the government will not make even Rs 40000 cr from STT in FY 25/26, at least 50% below the Rs 80,000 cr estimate.""Kamath shared two charts with the post. Take a look at them here.Intense selling by foreign investors, driven by growing uncertainties over Trump’s tariffs, wiped out 1,414 points—or nearly 2%—from the Sensex this week, wiping nearly Rs 9 lakh crore in investor wealth. Meanwhile, the broader Nifty has declined for the fifth consecutive month, marking its longest losing streak in points since its launch in 1996.However, it's not all gloom for investors as market advisory company Merisis said that the ongoing downturn may mark the final stage of capitulation, setting the stage for a strong counter-trend bounce in the markets over the next 4-6 weeks.Similarly, Jefferies’ Global Equity Strategist Chris Wood said that the ongoing market correction is primarily technical in nature. “For the first time since the stock market started to correct properly, GREED & fear’s base case is that the sell-off is primarily technical in nature reflecting multiple compression rather than any drastic macro issues,” Wood wrote in the GREED & fear newsletter.","Indian stock markets witnessed a sharp and sustained downturn in February.

Meta AI: Making an identity beyond WhatsApp



There seems to be new competition brewing in AI Chatbots space. According to a report in CNBC another app – rival to ChatGPT and Google Gemini – is set to be launched soon. Meta AI will soon become one of the social media company’s standalone apps, joining Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp , CNBC said in a report. The company intends to debut a Meta AI standalone app during the second quarter, said the report quoting people familiar with the matter. The report added that this marks a major step in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s plans to make his company the leader in artificial intelligence by the end of the year, ahead of competitors such as OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet.And it seems OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is not liking this new competition or maybe not seeing it as serious enough a competition. Just hours after the CNBC report went live, ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made fun of the ""upcoming"" app from Facebook parent Meta. ""ok fine maybe we'll do a social app,"" wrote Sam Altman, quoting the report.He followed it up with another comment: ""lol if facebook tries to come at us and we just uno reverse them it would be so funny 🤣""Facebook introduced MetaAI in September 2023. Meta AI functions as a digital assistant capable of generating responses and images based on user prompts within Meta's existing platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. In April 2024, Meta integrated Meta AI more deeply by replacing the search feature across these apps with the chatbot, making it a central tool for user interaction.The upcoming standalone app is expected to provide users with more personalized and immersive experiences with Meta AI, potentially increasing engagement beyond the existing platforms. Additionally, Meta plans to test a paid subscription service for Meta AI, similar to offerings from OpenAI and Microsoft, providing users with access to advanced features of the chatbot.This development underscores Meta's strategic focus on artificial intelligence, with significant investments aimed at enhancing its AI infrastructure and capabilities. The standalone Meta AI app is poised to become a key component in Meta's efforts to lead the AI industry."," Meta AI will soon become one of the social media company’s standalone apps, joining Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp. The company intends to debut a Meta AI standalone app during the second quarter, said the report quoting people familiar with the matter.

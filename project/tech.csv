Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in. Think about it!”.",Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction. He also warned the CEOs against indiscriminately sharing proprietary work online, noting that web-scraping chatbots could inadvertently absorb and lead sensitive data. Protecting intellectual property, he said, must be a top priority in the AI era.Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations. He pointed out that businesses often underestimate the potential risk of falling behind.Along with this, he also urged the leaders to adopt AI strategically and combine technological foresight with strong governance and data protection.Recently, Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”",Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations.

The report quotes people familiar with the situation Google co-founder Sergey Brin is also said to be in discussions to purchase a Miami home, according to people familiar with the situation.Some analysts have termed Google founders' move to leave California strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos ’ relocation playbook. According to them, the timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look quite like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But the big difference here is that Jeff Bezos did not leave California. Amazon founder left Seattle, the city where he started the online bookseller that grew into the global tech giant, Amazon.In 2024, Bezos announced on Instagram that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said that the move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. In his Instagram post, Bezos called Seattle his home since 1994.However, the timing, as some analysts pointed out, also suggested another reason: Taxes. In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. As Washington state does not have a personal income tax, so the new levy marked the first time that Bezos would face state taxes on his stock sales. As reported by CNBC, in 2022, when the Washington state's Capital gains tax took effect, Bezos stopped selling. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of that year.After his move to Miami, Bezos reportedly made up for lost time. Quoting an SEC filing, the report says that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before January 31, 2025. And since Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains, so on the $2 billion sale that Bezos made, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state. On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he saved more than at least 600 million.California’s proposed ballot initiative has been proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system. It would impose a one-time, 5% tax on the assets of billionaires. The tax would retroactively apply to those who were California residents as of January 1, 2026. In December 2025, venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment company in Miami. Donald Trump's AI czar David Sacks unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.","Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”.

During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

Chinese players can purchase Nvidia H200 under these ‘special circumstances’

Report says Nvidia asked for advance payment, company denies





Chinese customs authorities have reportedly instructed agents that Nvidia’s high-end H200 artificial intelligence chips are currently prohibited from entering the country, as the silicon trade war escalates between Washington and Beijing. Citing sources briefed on the matter, news agency Reuters reported that the directive was paired with high-level meetings earlier this week.“The wording from the officials is so severe that it is basically a ban for now, though this might change in the future should things evolve,” one source told Reuters. The move comes despite recent conditional approval from the Trump administration for the chips to be exported to China. Domestic tech giants have already been warned against purchasing the processors unless absolutely necessary.The H200 is Nvidia’s second-most powerful AI chip, and is claimed to offer roughly six times the performance of the previously restricted H20 model. As per reports, the demand of Nvidia chips is high with orders for over two million units at $27,000 each.Reports have indicated that the Chinese government may approve H200 purchases under “special circumstances,” such as research and development partnerships at universities.However, using Nvidia chips for military application purposes is completely banned.“Beijing believes the US is desperate to sell AI chips to China. They believe China has the leverage to extract concessions from the U.S. in exchange for license approvals,"" said Chris McGuire, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.Recently, a report in Reuters also claimed that Nvidia has set strict advance payment requirements for Chinese companies buying H200 Al chips, including a full payment upfront. This is purportedly due to the uncertainty on whether Chinese regulators would greenlight the shipments.However, in a statement Nvidia denied the claims, saying that it does not require upfront payment for H200 chips. The company said it ""would never require customers to pay for products they do not receive"".","Chinese customs authorities have reportedly instructed agents that Nvidia’s high-end H200 artificial intelligence chips are currently prohibited from entering the country.

The ‘power bottleneck’ in AI boom





Tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon, among other have lately been in an AI war in the Silicon Valley over researchers and data scientists. But as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom matures, a new “talent war” has emerged: the battle for hiring energy experts. Citing data from Workforce.ai, CNBC has reported that energy-related hiring in the tech sector jumped 34% year-on-year in 2024. As of early 2026, the pace remains roughly 30% higher than pre-AI levels.The report indicates that tech giants are now scrambling to strengthen their ‘energy teams’ to secure massive amounts of electricity to run their data centres – which is currently the primary bottleneck for scaling AI. To meet the increasing demand, Big Tech are reportedly moving beyond traditional sustainability and “green” roles, hunting for operational veterans in energy procurement, strategy and regulatory affairs.According to the report, Microsoft has emerged as a major victor in this specialised talent grab, securing over 570 energy-related hires since 2022. High-profile additions include Betsy Beck, who joined as Director of Energy Markets after a stint at Google, and former GE CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe, who was brought on as COO in 2024 to oversee the firm’s operational playbook.Similarly, Amazon (including AWS) remains the overall leader with 605 hires, while Google has added 340 experts to its roster since 2022. Google’s recent hires include Eric Schubert, a 14-year veteran of BP, and Duke University researcher Tyler Norris.The shift in hiring energy talent is driven by the high energy requirements of modern data centres, which now account for an estimated 1.5% of global electricity consumption. This has also prompted tech giants to strike deals with nuclear power suppliers. For example, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, recently announced a $4.75 billion deal to acquire the data center firm Intersect. The company is also aiming to launch a solar-powered data centre in 2027.","Energy-related hiring in the tech sector jumped 34% year-on-year in 2024.

“As a CEO steering a company's strategy and execution, any additional inputs and learnings and challenges strengthen my work.”

“incredible supplemental tool”

“nailed”

“With any AI agents, you need to be really careful not to believe the bullshit. They're predictive, and they're good, but not perfect. They're not human, and they miss a lot of cues,”

“I’ll say things like: Hey, I’m doing a presentation for our kickoff meeting next week. What do you think are the top three themes I should hit?”

“They viewed the fantasy board the same way I do, which is that it's a nice add-on, a sort of augmentation of thought partnership. But that it's never going to be a substitute for a real board,”

“I am proud to be among the first CEOs to use an avatar in an earnings call. It is just one example of how Zoom is pushing the boundaries of communication and collaboration,”





Markup AI's CEO, Matt Blumberg, has created an AI-generated ""fantasy board of directors” of 15 digital advisors to help him plan meetings and challenge his business ideas. The group includes AI versions of famous leaders like Steve Jobs Warren Buffett , and Oprah Winfrey . Blumberg said he uses these AI tools to get faster feedback, since his real board members may not always be available to provide it. The system uses profiles built from thousands of words of public data to copy the leadership styles of these famous figures. By using models like ChatGPT and Gemini, the CEO can now get advice on business proposals and prepare for real-world governance tasks at any time.In a statement to Fortune, Blumberg said,He also explained that in the fast-moving AI industry, his fantasy board gives him quick, ‘whenever-he-needs-it’ advice that traditional board meetings sometimes can't provide.He noted that setting up the fantasy board only took about an hour or two and is now anfor preparing for real board meetings with human members or working on internal company projects.He also asked the AI to evaluate his work performance in 2025, which he said itby highlighting his real strengths and weaknesses.Right now, Blumberg is using the technology to prepare for his annual employee and board meetings. But like any AI, he stressed that it's not perfect.Blumberg added.he said to Business Insider (BI).However, for Blumberg, the technology isn't about replacing people, but it's about helping them do better. He said his real board of directors isn't worried about being replaced anytime soon.he said to BI.Blumberg's experiment is part of a broader trend in which companies are integrating AI into top-level decision-making and company leadership.Last week, JPMorgan Chase announced it was cutting ties with major advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis. Instead, it's using its own AI-powered platform, Proxy IQ, to help inform shareholder voting decisions. This shows how deeply AI tools are being used.Other CEOs have gone even further with AI, sometimes by creating virtual versions of themselves.Zoom CEO Eric Yuan appeared on an earnings call last year as an AI-generated avatar that looked and sounded like him, delivering his opening remarks.Yuan's AI avatar said.This happened after Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski did something similar, using an AI-generated video copy of himself on an earnings call. The financial tech company has also created a 24/7 “AI CEO Hotline,” which answers customer questions in Siemiatkowski's speaking style, in both English and Swedish.","Markup AI's CEO, Matt Blumberg, has created an AI-generated ""fantasy board of directors’ of 15 digital advisors to help him plan meetings and challenge his business ideas.

Beijing fears the software could transmit confidential data abroad, aligning with its broader push to replace Western technology with domestic alternatives amid escalating US-China tech tensions.

Why is China concerned with US cybersecurity software





China has reportedly banned several American and Israeli cybersecurity firms. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Chinese authorities told local companies to stop using cybersecurity software from about a dozen foreign providers due to national security concerns. The ban includes US companies like Broadcom-owned VMware, Palo Alto Networks, and Fortinet. Officials stated they are concerned the software could “collect and transmit confidential information abroad.”The move follows recent efforts by Beijing to replace Western technology with domestic alternatives. China has also reportedly named the Israeli company Check Point Software Technologies in the directive. The report cited sources to claim that the notice was issued in recent days amid growing trade and tech tensions between China and the US. However, Reuters didn’t specify how many Chinese companies received the notice, which the report said was issued recently.The Reuters report cited people familiar with the matter to claim that Chinese officials were worried that the software offered by these companies may collect secret information and send it to other countries.The report didn’t identify the sources who didn't want to give their names, because the topic is sensitive.China's internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology also didn't respond to requests for comment when this was published. The four companies also didn't respond to Reuters' questions.As the US and China compete for technology leadership while their relationship remains tense, Beijing has been working hard to replace Western technology with Chinese-made alternatives.While efforts to develop its computer chip and artificial intelligence industries have received the most attention, China has also been trying to replace Western computers and word-processing software.Chinese experts have also said that Beijing is increasingly worried that foreign governments could gain access to Western equipment.Recently, China rejected Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's advice to buy its chips, as the Chinese government made it very difficult for tech companies to purchase its H200 AI chips.China reportedly told some tech companies that they can buy these chips only in exceptional cases, such as university research. The Chinese government’s instructions to companies weren’t clear, as they were told to purchase chips only when ""necessary"" - but what ""necessary"" means wasn’t explained.This shows that China is still cautious about allowing the American chipmaker Nvidia back into the Chinese market. The government plans to meet with more companies to provide them with the exact instructions, but it's unclear whether it will offer more explicit guidance in those meetings.","Beijing fears the software could transmit confidential data abroad, aligning with its broader push to replace Western technology with domestic alternatives.

He stressed that falling behind in technology means losing to fintech rivals. While acknowledging competitive sensitivity, Dimon revealed their $2 billion AI investment is already breaking even, calling it just the beginning.

Wall Street's new reality: Banks now compete with tech giants

JPMorgan's $2 billion AI bet already breaking even





Jamie Dimon is done apologizing for JPMorgan's massive tech bill. During the bank's Tuesday earnings call, the CEO made it crystal clear that he won't sacrifice competitive advantage to hit expense targets, even as shareholders questioned a planned $9 billion spending increase in 2026.The blunt message came after Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo pressed him for details on how the bank would recover its AI investments. Dimon's response wasn't a detailed breakdown—it was a warning. ""We're not going to try to meet some expense target, and then 10 years from now, you'd be asking us a question, how did JPMorgan get left behind?"" he said, his tone decidedly firm.JPMorgan is already spending roughly $18 billion annually on technology, with AI becoming embedded across trading, research, customer service, and everything in between. The bank employs thousands on AI initiatives alone. Yet Dimon refused to provide granular details on returns, citing competitive sensitivity. ""Part of it is to trust me, I'm sorry,"" he told investors, injecting a rare moment of levity into an otherwise tense exchange.What makes Dimon's stance remarkable is his unvarnished comparison. JPMorgan isn't just battling traditional rivals anymore. It's competing against fintech upstarts like Stripe, SoFi, and Revolut—companies that have redefined customer expectations around speed and personalization.For Dimon, this means the old playbook no longer applies.""You need to be the best in the world in tech. That drives investment, it drives margin, it drives competition,"" he explained. The message was unmistakable: underspend on technology, and you're slowly dying in a fintech-dominated landscape.Earlier this month, Dimon offered more encouraging numbers. He revealed that JPMorgan's $2 billion annual AI spend is now generating roughly equivalent savings—a milestone he called ""just the tip of the iceberg."" The bank's hundreds of AI use cases range from internal operations to external-facing tools.The reality check, however, came from market reaction. JPMorgan's stock tumbled over 4% Tuesday after the earnings announcement, reflecting investor jitters about whether the spending spree will actually deliver promised returns. Whether Dimon's faith-based approach to tech investment persuades Wall Street remains to be seen.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is doubling down on tech spending.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s full post

Electricity prices going up due to AI data center construction across America has become a big enough political issue that President Trump is asking Big Tech to be responsible in their data center plans and Microsoft has pledged to cooperate.

Meanwhile, sustainability has disappeared from the Big tech vocabulary in the rush to AI, and that tells you how much conviction they had about climate change.

It was always part of their virtue-signaling, nothing more.

In India, we have no option but to seek an energy-efficient, sustainable approach to AI and I believe that is possible. I don't view climate change as a political issue, but as part of the broader question of how humanity can live in harmony with nature.





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently took a jab at Google , Microsoft, Amazon and other tech giants saying that they have abandoned sustainability claims amid rapid scaling of artificial intelligence (AI). Sharing a post on X, Sridhar Vembu wrote “sustainability has disappeared from the Big tech vocabulary in the rush to AI, and that tells you how much conviction they had about climate change. It was always part of their virtue-signaling, nothing more.” India, on the contrary, has “no option but to seek an energy-efficient, sustainable approach to AI and I believe that is possible,” writes Vembu.The Zoho founder also criticised the AI boom’s rising power demands, commenting on rising electricity prices due to AI data centers in the US. He quoted Microsoft’s recent five-point plan to address growing public anger over AI data centers. At an event in Washington, Microsoft President Brad Smith announced “Our data centre won’t lead to an increase in your electricity prices if you are a neighbour in the community”.“We cannot protect against all sources of inflation, but we can definitely ensure that our data centre, the one that we build and own and operate, doesn’t lead to a price increase that you will see in your electricity bill,” he added.In the X post, Vembu wrote:","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu criticizes tech giants for abandoning sustainability in the AI race, calling it 'virtue-signaling' He highlights rising electricity costs due to AI data centers in the US, contrasting it with India's necessity for an energy-efficient AI approach.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126526340,imgsize-27162,width-400,resizemode-4/126526340.jpg"

Conclusion





The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure experienced a seismic shift in recent months. Nvidia, which is being seen as the ‘undisputed king’ of the AI hardware boom (specifically Graphic Processing Units, or GPUs), saw billions erased from its market value after a report claimed that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is partnering with Google to train its next-generation Llama AI models on the search giant’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).Nvidia’s GPUs have been the gold standard with major tech giants, and even new startups, are ordering these specialised chips in bulk. This has led to a global shortage and provided an opportunity for other players like AMD to take advantage of this demand-supply gap. Google is another player that has risen to the occasion, and opened its door for tech players to use its specialised AI chips to train their models.Meta’s pivot toward alternative hardware highlights a vulnerability in Nvidia’s armor and signals a maturing of the market, suggesting that the “one size fits all” era of AI hardware may be ending and strategic use of hardware can not only save money but also time. To understand why a company like Meta would look away from Nvidia, and why Nvidia would spend $20 billion to acquire a startup like Groq, we must look under the hood. In this article, we are dissecting the fundamental differences between the GPUs, the application-specific TPUs, and the emerging LPU.Nvidia did not start by manufacturing GPUs for AI tasks. Originally, the GPUs were designed for one specific task: rendering 3D graphics for video games.For example, to make an explosion in a video game look realistic or to render a tyndall effect – (scattering of light by particles by fog or trees). The compute needed to calculate the colour and trajectory of thousands of individual pixels simultaneously was high and GPUs handled these tasks easily. GPUs usually complement a Central Processing Unit (CPU), like the Intel chip in your laptop. This means that complex things are done very quickly in a particular sequence.Researchers realised that the math and power required to render a video game explosion is identical to the math required to train a neural network. Nvidia capitalised on this by creating CUDA, its famous software layer that allowed developers to use these graphics cards for general-purpose computing. As the AI requirements increased, Nvidia came up Nvidia H100 chip can be used to train a massive Large Language Model (LLM) or mine cryptocurrency or drug discovery.While Nvidia was adapting its graphics cards for AI, Google took a different approach. As early as 2015, Google realised that their growing reliance on AI for Search, Photos and Translate much computing power but also speed for which they needed to expand their data centre footprint. However, as the sophisticated AI tasks and machine learning became crucial for their products, they built their own chip from scratch: the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).The TPU is an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), which means they are designed to execute specific tasks that too at a specific speed. For example, Google Translate uses AI to quickly translate a foreign language into one that you understand. The success of tool is dependent on two critical factors: accuracy and latency (speed).Imagine you are waiting a train in Japan and you use Google Translate to confirm the destination of a train. If the processing speed is slow, the delay could cause you to miss your train. In this scenario, a technically perfect translation is useless if it is not delivered in real time – highlighting the need of “instant” AI responses. A TPU is designed to do exactly this: accelerate tensor math.The architecture of a TPU is also different from a GPU and CPU where the chip goes to memory, fetches data, does a calculation and writes it back to memory. This constant back-and-forth takes certain time. In the case of a TPU, data flows through the chip like blood through a heart and the calculation is done in real time – without going back to memory every time. This not only reduces electricity consumption but also increases speed for specific math operations.There is another difference. Nvidia sells its GPUs which means you can own them by spending billions of dollars. Google’s model is different, you cannot buy a TPU and they are only available as a service through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).To understand the basics of the need for GPUs and TPUs, we must understand the distinction between the two stages of an AI’s life: Training and Inference.This can be seen as university years when an AI is being trained on data sets. It is fed trillions of words, photos, videos so that it can understand connections and understand patterns. This is incredibly computationally expensive and can take months. For example, you study to be a doctor in your university years and understand how a human body works.Nvidia GPUs won this because training involves a lot of experimentation and trial-and-error, and its GPUs provide a flexibility – like reading different types of books on the same subject. Most major labs, including ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, xAI and even Google, have all relied on Nvidia GPUs for training.This is when the AI is actually working. When you type a prompt into Gemini and it spits out an answer, that is inference. The model is not learning but it is utilising what it has learnt to produce an answer – similar to a practising doctor. It has learnt a lot during its university years and now utilising those learnings to produce results and treat patients. While GPUs help in learning, TPUs also provide speed (low latency) and cost-efficiency. That’s why, companies are now moving to a combination of GPUs and TPUs.This explains Meta’s shift. As Meta looks to infuse its products with Llama AI models, they are moving from a phase of pure training to a phase of inference.Soon after Meta’s announcement, Nvidia moved to make a strategic $20 billion acquisition of Groq for the LPU (Language Processing Unit). Groq was founded by Jonathan Ross, who formerly helped invent the TPU at Google.Groq explains Language Processing Unit on its website as:Groq builds fast AI inference. Groq® LPU™ AI inference technology delivers exceptional AI compute speed, quality, and affordability at scale.Groq AI inference infrastructure, specifically GroqCloud™, is powered by the Language Processing Unit (LPU), a new category of processor. Groq created and built the LPU from the ground up to meet the unique needs of AI. LPUs run Large Language Models (LLMs) and other leading models at substantially faster speeds and, on an architectural level, up to 10x more efficiently from an energy perspective compared to GPUs.With this acquisition, Nvidia can now offer GPUs for Training and LPUs for Inference (where speed is everything) – transitioning it from a “GPU company” for AI to a “Total Compute Company.”By integrating this technology, Nvidia wants to minimise the threat posed by Google’s TPUs. This means that if an Nvidia customer says, ""Nvidia GPUs are too slow and power-hungry for inference, I'm going to Google,"" the company can reply, ""Don't go to Google. Use our new Nvidia LPU instead.""Now question arises: If TPUs are so efficient, why hasn't everyone switched already? The answer lies in software. We mentioned CUDA software which is Nvidia’s greatest asset. This is the software that developers use to talk to the GPU through millions of lines of code, libraries and tools. So, when you switch from GPU to TPU, its not like switching from an iPhone to Android – it’s like switching from speaking English to speaking Mandarin. You have to rewrite code and even change frameworks.However, this barrier is being taken care of. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian recently said that the company is actively working to make their models compatible and portable, by making its easier to write code once and run it on any chip. The battle is going from raw power necessity to efficiency, speed and specialisation.As AI companies are now serving a large number of users, tech companies are now going a step ahead. They now need to deliver responses to a relatively large number of users with low latency, which means requiring more TPUs and LPUs. However, if combined with High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) for the next generation of computing, it reduces the dependency on specialised chips to undertake tasks quickly.Large Language Models (LLMs) require massive datasets to flow through processors without interruption and HBM’s superior bandwidth-to-pin ratio ensures that GPUs and AI accelerators are never “starved” for data, significantly shortening training times and reducing latency during real-time inference. Beyond raw power, HBM offers a better thermal and energy profile. Industry leaders like Nvidia and AMD are already standardising HBM in their flagship AI chips for high-performance computing (HPC).The availability of specialised chips for different tasks underlines the evolution of the AI industry. As the market matures, tech companies are likely to use a combination of different types of chips to execute AI tasks in an efficient, cost-effective method with low-latency.GPUs will be used for training the models and grow them into sophisticated tools underlying the next-gen technology by offering trillion-parameter scales. Specialised chips (TPUs, LPUs) will be used for the daily grind of serving the AI to users.","The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure experienced a seismic shift in recent months.

He points out that while China's energy infrastructure is evolving rapidly—with an impressive addition of 500 gigawatts—the U.S. has shockingly added 'zero.

Kevin O'Leary ’s warning for America on China





Canadian billionaire investor Kevin O’Leary has raised alarm on America’s ability to sustain its artificial intelligence boom, bluntly declaring that the United States lacks the physical infrastructure to power the technology it pioneered. In a post shared on social media platform (formerly known as Twitter) O’Leary argued that while AI productivity has fuelled record highs in the S&P 500 across all 11 sectors over the past two years, the U.S. energy grid is dangerously stagnant compared to China’s aggressive expansion.“Here’s our problem… We have no power,” O’Leary said. He contrasted America’s grid stagnation with China’s rapid buildout, noting that Beijing has added 500 gigawatts of power in the last 24 months, while the U.S. has built “zero.” Without massive infrastructure upgrades, O’Leary warned, the U.S. cannot sustain the energy-hungry data centers required for the next phase of AI.Apart from the grid, O’Leary also criticised US economic policy and warned that investors should not expect refile from interest rates while Jerome Powell remains Federal Reserve Chair. He also feels that tariffs are a direct driver of inflation.“I’m not as optimistic that jawboning the Fed is going to get rates reduced anytime soon.I mean this is an unusual situation obviously, but I don't think you can count on rate cuts while Powell's there. This tariff situation is getting really interesting. Tariffs themselves on commodities or goods that you don't create yourself is inflationary. There's no way around it. Get rid of those tariffs so they can bring down those increased costs on that affordability issue.The reason the S&P maintains new highs, in my opinion, is the productivity factor brought in by AI tools that have just started to be used in the last 24 months is really effective. We're starting to see how good this can be across all 11 sectors. Here's our problem and why I have a little caution to these statements. We have no power. The Chinese have built 500 gigawatts in the last 24 months. We have built zero. We have no power on the grid. This is a big problem,” wrote Kevin on X.While acknowledging the effectiveness of AI tools, he stressed that software alone cannot deliver growth without the hardware — and the wattage — to run it.",Canadian billionaire investor Kevin O’Leary has raised alarm on America’s ability to sustain its artificial intelligence boom.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman recently said that tariffs are “terrible” for Americans. Hoffman, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump administration, recently appeared on a Wired podcast where he highlighted several key decisions that he considers are “terrible”. “The way that ICE is operating is terrible for people. Tariffs are terrible for people. Anti-vaccination is terrible for children's health,” Hoffman said during the podcast.During his second term, Donald Trump has enacted a series of tariffs on different countries including China, India and Russia. Last week, Trump approved a 500% tariff on Russian oil and withdraws from the ISA. He recently announced a 25% tariff on countries trading with Iran.While ICE or the Immigration and Customs Enforcement has taken the lead in carrying out the Trump administration’s mass deportation, a central promise of his 2024 election campaign.

He warns that the company's strategy of constructing vast data centers and bespoke chips could jeopardize its return on invested capital, signaling a departure from its previously successful, resource-efficient software approach.

Michael Burry’s critique of Meta Compute

high-risk, low-efficiency bet

Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute





Michael Burry, one of America’s biggest investors has now issued a sharp warning to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , criticising the company’s massive push into artificial intelligence infrastructure. Recently, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook-parent is establishing a new top-level initiative called Meta Compute. “Meta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time. How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage. This effort will be led by Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross,” said Zuckerberg in a post on Threads.Now, in a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Burry said that Meta is wasting its saving grace by building Meta Compute. He further added that creating Meta Compute will means to ‘Watch ROIC crash’.“And Meta gives in, throwing away its one saving grace. Watch ROIC crash,” wrote Burry. He made this comment on the Meta Compute announcement made by Zuckerberg. Burry feels that Meta’s ‘saving grace’ has always been its asset-light software model, which generated enormous profits from code and advertising with minimal physical infrastructure.He also argues that with Meta Compute, the company is undermining the efficiency that once made it a cash-generating powerhouse.Some online report suggests that Meta plans to spend $600 million via 2028 on data centres, energy grids, and custom chips to power Meta Compute. Burry feels that this spending spree will lead to a collapse in return on invested capital (ROIC) — a key measure of how effectually a company turns investment into profit.Unlike the past model, where profits scaled with relatively little capital, Meta’s new approach dramatically increases the denominator of the ROIC equation, making it harder to sustain high efficiency.Burry also accused Zuckerberg of of “giving in” to the industry-wide AI arms race, sacrificing Meta’s historically lean and profitable model for aon physical infrastructure. While most of Wall Street has cheered Meta’s AI ambitions, Burry remains one of the few contrarian voices warning of long-term risks.In a post shared on Threads, Zuckerberg wrote, “Today we're establishing a new top-level initiative called Meta Compute. Meta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time. How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage. This effort will be led by Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross.Santosh will continue to lead our technical architecture, software stack, silicon program, developer productivity, and building and operating our global datacenter fleet and network. Daniel will lead a new group responsible for long-term capacity strategy, supplier partnerships, industry analysis, planning, and business modeling.They will work closely with Dina Powell McCormick, who just joined Meta as President and Vice Chairman to work on partnering with governments and sovereigns to build, deploy, invest in, and finance Meta's infrastructure. I'm looking forward to working closely with Daniel, Santosh, Dina and their teams to scale Meta Compute and deliver personal superintelligence to billions of people around the world.”","Investing heavyweight Michael Burry has voiced concerns over Meta's grand plans for its AI framework, dubbed Meta Compute.

Elon Musk on AI redefining healthcare and generational preferences

Online reactions to Musk’s statements on healthcare

What Musk’s prediction means for medical education





Elon Musk has reopened the discourse on the future of healthcare and medical education after claiming that AI can offer far better healthcare than world leaders currently. These statements were on a podcast that was conducted by Peter H. Diamandis, the executive chairman of the X Prize Foundation, alongside DataSage Co-Founder David Blundin. These statements have caused widespread intrigue on the internet.In a video clip that circulated on the platform X via the handle @unusual_whales, Musk claimed that AI would one day bring universal access to world-class healthcare. Everyone would have access to healthcare that's better than the current presidential healthcare, Musk said. Asked whether medical school was obsolete by Diamandis, Musk declared, ""Yes. Pointless. Unless you. I think that applies to any educational field. ""The podcast also discussed intergenerational differences in opinions about medical procedures. Diamandis commented:""The younger generation says, I do not want that human touching me, right? When the surgeon comes over. There are going to be those people later in life who still want the human in the loop.""According to Diamandis, this is because the younger generation likes AI assistance in medical procedures or even robotic medical procedures over involving humans in the procedures.Musk used this opportunity to give several examples of how automation was already being used in the medical industry, pointing out procedures such as LASIK eye surgery in which robots carried out specific tasks that were formerly done by humans by hand. ""We've seen some advanced cases of automation,"" he said, ""such as LASIK eye surgery, where the robot just lasers your eyeball. Do you want your eye doctor to come along with a hand laser?""This conversation illustrates a growing pattern, which is that while patients may require human interaction for their needs, the accuracy, reliability, and ability to reproduce on a mass scale offered by artificial intelligence could begin to challenge even the norm for advanced medical care.Elon’s statements have received various reactions on social media platforms. Most of the social media users supported the predictions made by Elon regarding the use of artificial intelligence. They argued that the use of artificial intelligence will ensure that high-quality medical treatment becomes freely accessible to everyone. “The unpopular truth nobody wants to hear: Elon is right on target about how AI will render free and universal access to world-class medical care so swift that pursuing a medical education will seem absurd. ”Some participants emphasized the potential of AI regarding transformation within the medical field, with a belief that technology could help improve medical diagnosis and reduce human error when treating patients. The role of AI also came up as a mention of ""proving ground"" regarding potential uses of artificial intelligence technology in thefuture.If AI continues to develop as Musk thinks it will, the traditional trajectory of medical education could undergo a revolution. Long years of studying and training would be less vital in routine care, with AI-driven systems handling things like diagnostics, treatment planning, and even surgical assistance.Yet Musk also suggested that medical schools could retain relevance for specific areas where human judgment, creativity, and empathy are irreplaceable. In other words, while automation may make certain aspects of health care more efficient, medical expertise will still be required in complex cases that demand a human touch.","Elon Musk has reopened the discourse on the future of healthcare and medical education after claiming that AI can offer far better healthcare than world leaders currently.

California judge’s ruling

Elon Musk’s allegations against OpenAI





The high-stakes legal battle between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is now officially headed to trial this spring. Federal Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has set jury selection for April 27, with proceedings starting the following day. The trial is said to last up to four weeks, through May 22, as per the court filings. The case stems from the lawsuit filed by Elon Musk last year. In the case filed, Musk accused OpenAI CEO Sam Altman of fraud over the company’s partnership with Microsoft and its shift toward a for-profit model.Tesla CEO Elon Musk who co-founded and financially supported OpenAI with contributions totalling $38 million, claims he did so under the understanding that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to altruistic goals. OpenAI countered then claims and said that Musk was aware of the for-profit pivot as early as 2018 and it still maintains its non-profit arm.Last week, California judge rejected OpenAI’s motion to end Elon Musk’s case against the ChatGPT maker, scheduling a trial for March. Musk, in a 2024 lawsuit, has alleged that OpenAI violated its founding mission in its high-profile restructuring to a for-profit entity. During a court hearing to consider whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that there was “plenty of evidence”, reports Reuters.“It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work,” Rogers said, adding “This case is going to trial”.Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 along with CEO Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. He left in 2018 due to disagreements over control and direction of the company.In a 2024 lawsuit, The billionaire entrepreneur alleges that OpenAI has strayed from its original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity and instead prioritised commercial interests.Elon Musk claims that OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft resulted in significant funding and resources for the company, which is a breach of the company's founding contract.“After Musk lent his name to the venture, invested significant time, tens of millions of dollars in seed capital, and recruited top Al scientists for OpenAI, Inc., Musk and the non-profit's namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices. The perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions,” the lawsuit claims.“Once OpenAI, Inc.'s technology approached transformative AGI, Altman flipped the narrative and proceeded to cash in,” it added.","Federal Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has set jury selection for April 27, with proceedings starting the following day.

Dell COO Jeff Clarke sends memo to employees says: This is the biggest transformation in company history; shares new deadline and adds we will no go back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dell-coo-jeff-clarke-sends-memo-to-employees-says-this-is-the-biggest-transformation-in-company-history-shares-new-deadline-and-adds-we-will-no-go-back/articleshow/126522891.cms,"Dell preparing for AI-driven future



Read Dell COO and vice chairman Jeff Clarke's full memo to Dell employees here:

Team,

Our industry is moving faster than ever, and we've spent the past two years modernizing how Dell works so we can move even faster—simplifying and standardizing processes, eliminating inefficiencies and improving our tools and applications. That's <One Dell Way>.

Now we're taking the next major step in this journey: rolling out standardized processes and an enterprise platform that will connect our data, break down silos, streamline our software applications and give us the foundation to work as one connected company.

We'll begin operating in this new way on May 3, starting with CSG, Finance, Supply Chain, Marketing, Sales, RevOps, Services and HR operations. ISG follows in August.

For years, our strong functional orientation meant we built many variations of fundamental processes—multiple ways to develop, multiple ways to market, multiple ways to sell, multiple ways to service.

That won't cut it in an AI-driven world. We need one way—simplified, standardized and automated—so we can be more competitive and serve our customers better.

This requires a mindset shift, from thinking and operating function-first to company-first. In some cases, that may mean we may make a choice that isn't optimal for a particular function, but it speeds up decision-making or improves quality for the company as a whole. That's the trade-off, and it's the right one. We're optimizing for Dell, not for individual functions.

What's Changing

Standardized processes and an enterprise platform mean no more workarounds, no holding onto old ways of working.

Instead, we get seamless data flow, fewer repetitive tasks, faster decision-making and more time for work that drives real impact.

This is a comprehensive change, not a gradual transition. Once we start operating in the new way on May 3, we won't go back.

The degree of change will vary by team and role. Some of you will experience significant shifts in how you work day-to-day. For others, the changes will be minimal. But all of us need to understand what's happening and support each other through it.

If your work spans both CSG and ISG, you'll navigate the new processes and applications for CSG, and legacy systems for ISG until August. You'll learn more in training.

What This Takes

Learning new systems and new ways of working isn't easy, especially when you're already moving fast. Here's my ask of you:

Stay curious and open-minded as you learn new ways of working.

Disrupt yourself. Break free from the old way of doing things.

Embrace standardization. It makes us faster and better.

Operate with a sense of urgency. Speed matters more than ever in the AI era.

Be Ready

Training is critical. You can't operate in the new system without it, no exceptions. Training opens February 3, and you'll get an email that day with your personalized information.

Please make it a priority.

This is the biggest transformation in company history. I know there will be challenges, and that's OK—we're here to support you and work through this together. Your leader will keep you updated as we move through training and launch.

This is foundational to our success in an AI-driven world, and One Dell Way is how we get there—working as one company, with one set of processes, focused on what matters most.

Let's lean in, learn as we go and build a better company together.

Jeff





Dell Technologies is now preparing for what COO and vice chairman Jeff Clarke has called the “biggest transformation in company history.” As reported by Business Insider, in a memo to its employees, Clarke has outlined some sweeping changes under the company’s modernisation initiative — One Dell Way, which will roll out on May 3, 2026. This new initiative of the company will replace Dell’s sprawl of applications, servers, and databases with a single enterprise platform designed to connect data, break down silos, and streamline operations. Clarke also added that the new system will deliver seamless data flow, fewer repetitive tasks, faster decision-making and more time for work which drives impact. “This is a comprehensive change, not a gradual transition.

“cause for concern”

""What we do have is, as American companies, a stronger reputation for trust. We have access to better chips than the Chinese companies do . . . [but] you always have to compete on price,""

“If American tech companies or western governments were to close their eyes to the future in Africa, they would be closing their eyes to the future of the world more broadly, and I think that would be a grave mistake,”





Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, has warned US President Donald Trump that China is winning the artificial intelligence (AI) race outside America. He noted that US companies are falling behind rivals in markets outside the country. Smith explains that the Chinese government uses low-costmodels and large state-backed subsidies to gain an advantage in AI. He also highlighted that the rapid growth of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek in countries such as Africa underscores the pressure American companies are facing globally.In an interview with the Financial Times (FT), Smith said:Smith’s comments come after new research from Microsoft found that the release of DeepSeek’s R1 large language model a year ago helped accelerate the uptake of AI worldwide, particularly in the global south, due to its. That has also helped China overtake the US in the global market for so-calledAI models, which are often free for developers to use, modify, and integrate.To compare, US tech companies such as OpenAI, Google and Anthropic have instead focused on maintaining complete control of their most advanced technology, profiting from it through customer subscriptions or enterprise deals, the study claimed.Based on usage data from products offered by tech companies, Microsoft’s research estimated that Chinese companies have an 18% share of the AI market in Ethiopia and 17% in Zimbabwe.Smith noted that African countries would need more funding fromorto help them build data centres and cover electricity costs.he explained.However, Bright Simons, vice-president at the IMANI think-tank in Ghana and an AI expert, said there was noto prove whether DeepSeek was really leading in Africa, but that free Chinese AI systems offered cheaper options.he said. He also mentioned that Africans were using their own locally-made small language models, such as Masakhane, a pan-African model, and the South African InkubaLM.Microsoft's research also showed that in countries where American technology products are blocked or limited, DeepSeek had gained a major advantage, with a 56% market share in Belarus, 49% in Cuba and 43% in Russia.DeepSeek surprised Silicon Valley when it launched its powerful AI reasoning model, R1, last year, claiming it was built at a lower cost with less computing power. DeepSeek is expected to release its highly anticipated new AI model before the Lunar New Year holiday.Microsoft's research even showed that AI use is currently highest in wealthier countries, with nearly a quarter of the global north using AI in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 14% of the global south and 16% globally.Smith said the growing gap was aand warned that “if we don't address a growing AI divide, it's likely to perpetuate and broaden the great economic divide between north and south.”He pointed out that this was an important battleground in the US's competition with China. He claimed that more investment was needed from private companies to build data centres and provide skills training, as well as money from governments and financial institutions.Smith added.Smith also warned that ignoring AI adoption in regions like Africa, which have young, rapidly growing populations, could lead to the rise of systems that don't support democratic values.he added.","Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, has warned US President Donald Trump that China is winning the artificial intelligence (AI) race outside America.

Tesla makes a 'quite change' in FSD definition





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that the electric car maker will stop selling its full self-driving (FSD) software after February 14, 2026. Currently, Tesla allows its customers to purchase FSD for a one-time payment of $8,000 or a subscription of $99 per month in the US. After February 14, it will be available as a monthly subscription. “Tesla will stop selling FSD after Feb 14. FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,” Musk wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) platform.For those unaware, FSD is an advanced driver-assistance system offered by Tesla. Despite the name, FSD does not mean the car drives fully on its own. Instead, it is a software package that helps with driving tasks but still requires the driver to stay alert and keep control of the vehicle.Elon Musk’s post has sparked curiosity among X users. Responding to his post, Tesla Owners Silicon Valley asked “What will be the price?”“What will happen to existing buyers if we convert FSD to Fully subscribed? will it be possible to transfer?,” asked another user. “Will owners of FSD be able to transfer ownership of FSD to a new Tesla purchase after Feb 14th?,” asked a third.A fourth user questioned: “What if I’ve already ordered a Cybertruck with the FSD Option included?”Last year, the electric vehicle manufacturer updated the description of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package on its website, shortly after CEO Elon Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package was announced.Tesla’s website states that the system does not make its vehicles autonomous.“Currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous,” Tesla’s update reads. It adds that the availability of features depends on regulatory approval and further development, which “may take longer in some jurisdictions.”","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that the electric car maker will stop selling its full self-driving (FSD) software after February 14, 2026.

Apple iOS 26.3 update could finally fix the biggest problem in iPhone and Android messaging that users have complained about for years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ios-26-3-update-could-finally-fix-the-biggest-problem-in-iphone-and-android-messaging-that-users-have-complained-about-for-years/articleshow/126519166.cms,"iPhone users could soon enjoy fully encrypted cross-platform messaging with RCS



iOS 26.3 signals a new era of seamless iPhone and Android messaging



iOS 26.3 RCS encryption faces carrier and country-level limitations



iOS 26.3 hints at a broader messaging transition still in progress







Apple’s iOS 26.3 update is shaping up to be far more significant than a routine software refresh. While earlier versions of iOS introduced RCS support to improve communication between iPhones and Android devices, this upcoming update suggests a deeper transformation is underway. According to the MacRumors report, evidence found in the iOS 26.3 beta indicates that Apple is preparing the Messages app for end-to-end encrypted RCS conversations, a move that could finally place cross-platform messaging on equal footing with iMessage in terms of privacy and usability.For hundreds of millions of iPhone users, this change has the potential to remove long-standing frustrations associated with green-bubble conversations.For several years, the fallback mechanism for messaging between iPhones and other devices was SMS and MMS messaging. The problem with these standards is that they never addressed the modern needs of messaging and did not have functionalities such as encryption, high-quality media transfer, and message delivery confirmation. Apple made a beginning with iOS 18 through the inclusion of RCS support as per reports.Nevertheless, this early RCS solution had some limitations. The messages remained unencrypted, and many of the features iPhone users had come to enjoy with iMessage remained inaccessible while communicating with those on Android.The clue to what the next step will be for Apple will come through the RCS Universal Profile 3.0. This latest version is imperative for facilitating end-to-end encryption of RCS messages as well as access to other enhanced functionalities. From the latest beta release of iOS 26.3, it appears as if Apple will be upgrading its RCS implementation to handle this latest profile.It will end-to-end encrypt messages and attachments sent between devices, with only the receiver able to view them. Neither Apple, its carrier, nor any third-party individual will be able to intercept messages that are being sent when they are end-to-end encrypted. This has been an iMessage feature for over a decade, and it has never been an option between platforms until now.Apart from the encryption feature, iOS 26.3 is also expected to bring significant improvements to the overall RCS experience. This is because messaging between an iPhone and an Android device is expected to have features that are currently on iMessage. Examples of these are in-line replies that enable users to respond to particular messages in a conversation, as well as the ability to unsend or edit sent messages.Tapback reactions should also function as expected, getting rid of the confusing text reactions that are shown when an Android user receives an iMessage reaction. All of this should make conversations feel consistent, irrespective of the devices that are used.Apple has promoted end-to-end encryption on iMessage since at least iOS 5, a very high bar when it comes to secure communication. Over the years, they introduced very sophisticated features that include two-way replies, editing, and undo's on messages. It is only with this technology that iMessage has been distinct from any cross-platform messaging service until now.By providing these capabilities in RCS as well, Apple is effectively bridging the gap between blue bubble and green bubble conversations. This is because the company has finally realised that encrypted and feature-rich messaging is not limited by device ecosystem boundaries.Although Apple has made steps forward with iOS 26.3, the final deployment of encrypted RCS messaging rests with mobile carriers. Every carrier will need to be prepared by implementing support for RCS Universal Profile 3.0 on its network, and that adoption is unlikely to occur at the same time across all regions.Because of that, encrypted RCS could start rolling out in a few countries or on particular networks before going live everywhere. It also means that some users will get the update before others, even if they're running the same version of iOS.Since RCS is also supported by Google on Android, Apple needs to work in close coordination with Google to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Google already supports the encrypted messaging feature on RCS, and there should be synchronization between the two platforms because fragmentation may occur otherwise.This is a big change from how Apple communicated before, which puts greater emphasis on user experience and security.There is no official timeline released by Apple for the general availability of the encrypted RCS messaging service. Even in the release of iOS 26.3, it seems they have laid the foundation, but some of the functions may not be enabled right away. Carrier readiness and testing might lead to the delay of such functions until the release of iOS 27.As in the case with other beta offerings, Apple could hone or change functions prior to releasing it in mass form. If it becomes a reality, iOS 26.3 might signal the end of an era in terms of how users can interact with the larger world of smartphones when it comes to messaging. Confidential, up-to-date messaging capabilities will no longer remain the sole domain of iMessage. Instead, Apple’s vision with the new iOS 26.3 seems to be a future where the nature of communication is no longer based on security and usability, but on the instrument in one's hand.","iOS 26.3 hints at a broader messaging transition still in progress. Messages app could finally place cross-platform messaging on equal footing with iMessage in terms of privacy and usability. Apple has promoted end-to-end encryption on iMessage since at least iOS 5, a very high bar when it comes to secure communication.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126519352,imgsize-704776,width-400,resizemode-4/apple-ios-263-update-could-finally-fix-the-biggest-problem-in-iphone-and-android-messaging-that-users-have-complained-about-for-years.jpg"
Polygon Labs to acquire Coinme and Sequence for over US$250 million to expand US stablecoin payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/polygon-labs-to-acquire-coinme-and-sequence-for-over-us250-million-to-expand-us-stablecoin-payments/articleshow/126518437.cms,"



Polygon Labs has signed definitive agreements to acquire US based digital currency payments firm Coinme and wallet infrastructure provider Sequence for more than $250 million, a move aimed at accelerating its expansion into regulated stablecoin payments and building what it calls the Polygon Open Money Stack.The acquisitions bring together regulated fiat on- and off-ramps, wallet infrastructure, and cross-chain orchestration capabilities that are three critical components of Polygon’s strategy to enable stablecoin payments at global scale. Combined, Polygon, Coinme, and Sequence have already processed more than US$ 1 billion in offchain sales and facilitated over US$ 2 trillion in onchain value transfers.As payment activity grows, Polygon said increased throughput and network fees on the Polygon Chain would directly benefit stakers and validators. It will soon have the ability to do regulated stablecoin business in 48 states. Polygon’s onchain stablecoin supply stood at approximately US$ 3.3 billion at the close of 2025, a three-year high, according to data compiled on Dune.Founded in 2014, Coinme is one of the earliest licensed digital currency exchanges in the United States. The company operates with money-transmitter licenses in 48 US states and runs a nationwide physical fiat-to-crypto network across more than 50,000 retail locations.Coinme also offers regulated crypto-as-a-service solutions, licensed wallet infrastructure, and enterprise APIs and SDKs. Backed by investors including Pantera, Digital Currency Group, Coinstar, Circle, and MoneyGram, Coinme serves enterprise clients such as Exodus, Coinstar, Mercuryo, and Baanx, alongside more than one million users of its payments app. Following regulatory approvals, Coinme will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Polygon Labs.Sequence, founded in 2017, brings smart wallets and a one-click cross-chain orchestration and intents engine designed to simplify crypto payments without requiring users to manage gas, swaps, or bridging. The company is backed by investors including Brevan Howard Digital, Initialized Capital, Coinbase, Polychain, Consensys, Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft, and Bitkraft. Its infrastructure supports major blockchain ecosystems such as Polygon, Immutable, Arbitrum, and Magic Eden, with additional support for emerging networks. Sequence also collaborates with Google Cloud as a partner and distribution channel.Trails, powered by Sequence, provides universal rails for one-click crypto transactions across chains, tokens, and wallets, enabling interoperability and stablecoin payments via Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol.“These acquisitions give us regulated access to U.S. payment rails, wallet infrastructure, and cross-chain intents capabilities to build an open payments business on top of onchain settlement,” said Marc Boiron, chief executive officer of Polygon Labs, noting that stablecoins are increasingly being used as a settlement layer for global payments.Polygon Foundation founder Sandeep Nailwal said the company aims to become “the biggest stablecoin money movement avenue in the world,” adding, “Our mission is to move all money onchain and rebuild how money works so it is instant, reliable, programmable, and open.”Neil Bergquist, CEO of Coinme, said the deal would help unify fragmented stablecoin infrastructure. “By combining Coinme's regulated payment access with Polygon's settlement layer, we're building the vertically integrated stack the market needs,” he said.Sequence co-founder and CEO Peter Kieltyka added that simplifying onboarding and cross-chain payments would help overcome barriers to mainstream adoption.The Sequence transaction is expected to close this month, while the Coinme acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, subject to customary regulatory approvals.","Polygon Labs has signed definitive agreements to acquire US based digital currency payments firm Coinme and wallet infrastructure provider Sequence.

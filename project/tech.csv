In the most unexpected occurrence in the technology space, Sanmay Ved, an ex-Google employee hailing from Mandvi, Gujarat, briefly owned one of the web's most iconic digital assets — Google.com. This bizarre incident happened in September 2015 when Ved was testing out Google's domain-name registration service, Google Domains . What ensued was a sudden but intriguing episode that pointed to a seldom-seen security failure within the firm's internal system.In the wee hours of the morning on September 29, 2015, about 1:20 AM Eastern Time, Ved was browsing through Google Domains carelessly when he stumbled upon something extremely surprising: the domain name Google.com was shown to be available for buy. Initially believing this to be an error, he tried going ahead with the transaction just for the heck of it.To his surprise, the deal went through error-free. He was able to buy Google.com for a paltry $12 (about Rs 800 at that time). The system sent a confirmation email and reflected on his Google Search Console dashboard with domain ownership information, indicating that he was, temporarily at least, the rightful owner of one of the internet's most valuable domains.The confirmation wasn't merely cosmetic. Google's own internal systems confirmed Ved's new status. His Search Console account started getting domain-related alerts, and admin tools belonging to the domain were made available to him.Later in a LinkedIn post, Ved wrote,Though his brief ownership only lasted around one minute, it was long enough to prove a serious lapse in Google's domain name management systems.Google's security team contacted soon after the event to probe the occurrence and verify the type of transaction. Upon analysis, Google recognised the vulnerability in their system that had put the domain in temporary availability and valued Ved's proper disclosure of the weakness.As an expression of gratitude, Google granted Ved a financial reward of $6,006.13. The strangely particular sum was not random — it was selected due to the fact that the numbers look like the word ""Google"" when considered in a different way.Subsequently, following the revelation that Ved had made the decision to donate the whole reward to charity, the corporation doubled the award, making the total $12,012.26.True to his principles, Ved donated the entire sum to the Art of Living India Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides free education to more than 39,200 disadvantaged children in 404 schools in India.Ved reiterated that his actions were motivated by principle, not by profit, saying:The foundation targets a comprehensive methodology to education, developing the body, mind, and spirit of every student. By doing this, Ved not only brought out a serious problem of cybersecurity but also donated to social welfare in a useful way.This incident brought focus to Google's larger Security Reward Program, which is a scheme aimed at motivating ethical hackers and researchers who identify vulnerabilities in Google's products and services responsibly. At the end of 2015, Google announced that it had rewarded more than $2 million to over 300 people under this scheme. Since its launch in 2010, the program has given away over $6 million in rewards worldwide.Researchers from various nations — such as the United States, India, Germany, Poland, Brazil, Israel, Romania, China, and Russia — have helped Google's platforms become safer for billions of people.In an official blog, Google said:","Ex-Google employee Sanmay Ved accidentally bought Google.com for just Rs 800.

Melinda French Gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, calling the split “necessary” despite her ex-husband recently describing it as the biggest regret of his life. In a January interview, Bill Gates said ending their 27-year marriage was ""at the top of the list"" when it came to personal failures. The couple, who married in 1994, officially parted ways in August 2021.Recently, in a candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed those comments, saying: “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.” While she chose not to directly respond to her ex-husband’s remarks, she noted: “I don’t even quite know what to make of that statement, so I’m not going to comment on what he says. He’s got his own life. I have my life now. I am very happy.”French Gates also spoke about the emotional toll of the divorce, revealing she suffered panic attacks during the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”The former couple share three adult children—Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25, and Phoebe, 22—and are now grandparents to two. While Bill Gates has been dating Paula Hurd, widow of former Oracle CEO Mark Hurd, since 2022, French Gates confirmed she is currently single and enjoying the dating scene.","Melinda French Gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from Microsoft co- founder Bill Gates.

It included Katy Perry (L), Gayle King, Aisha Bowe, Kerianne Flynn, Bezos’ fiancee Lauren Sanchez (bottom right) and Amanda Nguyen (AFP and Reuters)

Kiss and Hug: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos open the Rocket's door

Excitement, song and more from inside the Blue Origin Space flight

Blue Origin announcement by Lauren Sánchez

Pop icon Katy Perry and Lauren Sánchez, fiancée of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , soared to the edge of space Monday morning (April15) aboard Blue Origin ’s New Shepard rocket, marking the first all-female spaceflight in over six decades. Liftoff occurred at 9:31 a.m. ET from Blue Origin’s launch site in West Texas. The suborbital flight lasted approximately 11 minutes, delivering a brief but weightless experience for the six women aboard. Rounding out the historic crew were CBS broadcaster Gayle King, producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA engineer Aisha Bowe , and scientist-activist Amanda Nguyen.The company has previously flown several celebrity passengers, including Bezos himself in 2021, actor William Shatner, and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan. Monday’s flight, however, stood apart — not just for its famous passengers, but for the milestone it represented in space travel history. Blue Origin’s 11th crewed mission comes as the company eyes bigger ambitions. In January, it successfully launched its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket to orbit. Soon after, the company laid off around 10% of its workforce. CEO Dave Limp later said the company remains focused on future goals, including a planned moon landing with an uncrewed vehicle in 2025 and increased frequency for both New Shepard and New Glenn launches.According to a report in Bloomberg, after experiencing roughly four minutes of weightlessness, the capsule returned to Earth under parachutes, landing safely in the desert. Jeff Bezos was on hand to open the capsule’s hatch, where he embraced Sánchez. Perry followed, dropping to her knees and kissing the Earth.“I feel super connected to love,” Perry reportedly said after the flight, clutching a daisy she had taken into space. “It is the highest high, it is surrender to the unknown.” When asked how the trip compared to other highlights of her career, she replied, “This experience is second to being a mom.”During the flight, excitement echoed through the capsule. “You guys, look at the moon! Oh my god!” one crew member exclaimed, while Perry broke into a rendition of “What a Wonderful World.” According to King, the moment was filled with awe and emotion as they gazed at Earth from above.Sánchez first revealed her spaceflight ambitions during a 2023 interview with Vogue, emphasizing the significance of assembling an all-female crew. “These women are paving the way,” she said at the time.The launch drew a high-profile crowd. Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian watched from the viewing area and praised the mission as “inspirational.” Oprah Winfrey, a close friend of King, was also present. “None of us will ever forget this day,” she remarked.","Katy Perry and Lauren Sánchez, fiancée of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, soared to the edge of space Monday morning (April15) aboard Blue Origin ’s New Shepard rocket.

In a landmark achievement for commercial spaceflight and women's representation in aerospace, Blue Origin’s all-female crew has successfully returned to Earth following a historic suborbital journey aboard the New Shepard NS-31 mission. Launched from the company’s West Texas facility on April 14, 2025, the six-member crew traveled beyond the Kármán line—the internationally recognized boundary of space at 100 kilometers (62 miles) above Earth—before making a safe, parachute-assisted landing in the desert.The mission lasted just over 11 minutes, offering the crew approximately four minutes of weightlessness and panoramic views of Earth. It was streamed live, drawing a global audience and marking a major milestone in the evolution of space tourism.The NS-31 flight is Blue Origin’s latest suborbital mission using the New Shepard rocket, a fully autonomous and reusable launch vehicle designed to carry civilians briefly into space. The capsule detached from the booster after liftoff, ascended beyond the Kármán line, and then descended under parachutes for a soft landing in the desert.This mission is part of Blue Origin’s broader goal to normalize commercial space travel while emphasizing reusability and sustainability.The NS-31 crew included six accomplished women from diverse backgrounds in science, media, activism, and entertainment. The mission aimed to celebrate women’s contributions to space, science, and global influence.Who’s the richest on Blue Origin’s all-women crewPerry’s net worth is bolstered by years of record sales, TV judging contracts, and the $225 million sale of her music catalog in 2023.After their successful descent, the capsule was met by recovery teams. The door was opened by Jeff Bezos, and each woman exited to applause and cheers.From the ground, celebrities including Khloé Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey watched in support. Winfrey noted King's bravery, calling the experience “a personal breakthrough.”Each crew member underwent two days of intensive training at Blue Origin’s West Texas facility. Training included:Two additional ground support members, known as Crew Member Seven, provided real-time coaching and monitoring from the control center and training hub.","Blue Origin’s all-female crew has successfully returned to Earth following a historic suborbital journey aboard the New Shepard NS-31 mission.

"After making American showers ‘great’, US President Donald Trump wants the same for these appliances",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-making-american-showers-great-us-president-donald-trump-wants-the-same-for-these-appliances/articleshow/120288264.cms,"American Gas Association: Victory for working-class Americans…



“This is a victory for working-class Americans and for the environment, which benefits from the lower emissions of efficient, direct-use natural gas. President Biden’s block on certain natural gas appliances was deeply flawed legally and practically. The water heater rule would have removed consumer choices, placed a disproportionate financial burden on seniors and low-income Americans and pushed financially vulnerable consumers toward less efficient electric products likely to raise their energy bills.”

After changing shower regulations , US President Donald Trump has now turned his focus to home appliances. A recent Senate vote of 53-44 repealed a previously proposed rule that set energy efficiency standards for new tankless gas-powered water heaters. Set to take effect in 2029, this regulation would require that these water heaters consume 13% less energy. This move comes soon after Trump signed an executive order to remove limits on how much water can come out of showerheads. The canceled rule required each showerhead to use a maximum of 2.5 gallons per minute. Before signing the order, Trump criticised the restrcition for interfering with his hair care routine, claiming that the lengthy time required in the shower—15 minutes before his hair gets wet—is absurd.The American Gas Association (AGA) praised the decision and said that the previous rule banned the sale of instant, gas-fired appliances.In a blog post, AGA President and CEO Karen Harbert said:Meanwhile, the rule’s supporters said that it would’ve saved US households an average of $112 on energy bills and saved Americans $3.1 billion in 30 years.According to a report by ProPublica, besides showerheads and gas water heaters, Trump has repeatedly criticised dishwashers, arguing that they take so long and clean so ineffectively that “the electric bill is ten times more than the water”. He has also complained about toilets needing “ten or 15 flushes” and LED lightbulbs that he says give him an orange appearance.",US President Donald Trump has turned his focus to home appliances.

China has reportedly suspended exports of vital minerals and magnets, triggering concerns of widespread disruptions for global industries ranging from automotive and aerospace to semiconductors and defense. The move, seen as retaliation for escalating US tariffs, threatens to choke off supplies crucial for manufacturing a wide array of products, including cars, drones, robots, and missiles.According to a report by The New York Times, the export halt primarily affects rare earth magnets , essential components that are used in numerous electronic and mechanical systems. The report claims that shipments have been stopped at Chinese ports as the government develops a new regulatory system, which could potentially block supplies to specific companies, particularly US military contractors.This crackdown follows China’s April 4 order wherein it restricted the export of six heavy rare earth metals and rare earth magnets, nearly 90% of which are produced in China. These materials now require special export licenses, but the licensing system is not yet fully operational, causing anxiety among industry executives about prolonged delays and potential supply shortages.The suspended heavy rare earth metals are reportedly crucial for electric motors used in electric vehicles, drones, robots, missiles and spacecraft. They are also essential in manufacturing jet engines, lasers, car headlights, and capacitors for computer chips used in AI servers and smartphones.Last year, a report by news agency Reuters said that China banned exports of key minerals to the US after the US announced export restrictions on 140 Chinese companies and stricter controls on chipmaking equipment.China banned the export of minerals like gallium, germanium, and others.“In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted,” the ministry was quoted as saying.","China has reportedly suspended exports of vital minerals and magnets, triggering concerns of widespread disruptions for global industries.

A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”In response, Walmart defended its contributions to communities and the economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further added that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

US FTC during Facebook-parent Meta’s antitrust trial: ‘Consumers do not have…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-ftc-during-facebook-parent-metas-antitrust-trial-consumers-do-not-have/articleshow/120285351.cms,"What US FTC said about Meta’s ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram



“established entry barriers that for more than a decade protected Meta's dominance.""

""Consumers do not have reasonable alternatives they can turn to,""

What Meta said about the trial



“It's absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the Administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok.""

Facebook parent Meta Platforms is facing an antitrust trial over its ownership of popular social media and messaging apps Instagram and WhatsApp, respectively. At the beginning of a high-stakes trial, an attorney for the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said that the acquisition of nascent rivals Instagram and WhatsApp deprived consumers of the potential benefits these companies would have offered as independent entities. The trial, filed during President Donald Trump's first term, centers on the FTC's claim that Meta strategically bought the companies roughly a decade ago after its attempts to compete in the social media market had failed.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said that Meta’s ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp,Matheson added.US antitrust enforcers are seeking to investigate these deals, arguing that the acquisitions eliminated competition among social media platforms where users connect with friends and family. The FTC is also pushing for a restructuring of Meta's business, potentially forcing the company to sell off key assets like Instagram and WhatsApp.This case represents a major threat to Meta, as Instagram alone is estimated to generate about half of the company's US advertising revenue. The trial also serves as a test of the current administration's commitment to regulating Big Tech companies.FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson has also said that the Trump-Vance FTC is as prepared as possible for the trial, emphasising that its legal team has been working tirelessly around the clock to get ready, the report adds.However, since Trump’s re-election, Meta has actively sought the president's influence with moves like discarding content moderation policies that Republicans labeled as censorship and donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s multiple recent visits to the White House also highlight the company's ongoing effort to engage with and potentially sway the political climate.Commenting on the trial, Meta Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead said that the case was weak and discourages tech investment.In a blog post, Newstead wrote:","Facebook parent Meta Platforms is facing an antitrust trial over its ownership of popular social media and messaging apps Instagram and WhatsApp. At the beginning of a high-stakes trial, an attorney for the US Federal Trade Commission said that the acquisition of nascent rivals deprived consumers of the potential benefits these companies would have offered as independent entities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120285344,imgsize-39586,width-400,resizemode-4/US-FTC-during-Facebook-parent-Metas-antitrust-trial-Consumers-do-not-have.jpg"

The result has been nations lining up to negotiate deals with the administration. So far so good.

By pausing reciprocal tariffs for 90 days and exempting certain goods from tariffs this weekend, he has also shown considerable flexibility in understanding the challenges to US companies in adapting to the tariffs overnight.

By leaving a 145% tariff on China for the last few days, he has sent a message to China about the consequences to China of retaliating rather than coming to the negotiating table.

The problem is that there remain millions of small and medium-size American businesses that suffer from an inability to adapt to the tariffs on China overnight.

Bill Ackman urges Trump to halt China tariffs

If President Trump were to pause the

China tariffs

for 90 days and reduce them temporarily to 10%, he would achieve the same objective in causing US businesses to relocate their supply chains from China without the disruption and risk to these businesses in the short term, and he would have time to negotiate a deal with China.

China is under the same pressure to negotiate a deal whether the tariffs take effect immediately or if they take effect in 90 days.

The benefit of waiting 90 days is two fold. It gives all US businesses the opportunity to make supply chain adjustments, and it gives China the opportunity to show that it is willing to negotiate a trade deal in good faith.

If China does not cooperate and negotiate a deal that makes sense for our country, President Trump can bring the hammer down in 90 days.

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman , a supporter of Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign, has publicly called for a three-month pause on the broad and steep reciprocal tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. This appeal comes after Trump extended similar pauses to most other countries last week.Ackman, who has been critical of the current tariff policy , took to social media platform X to propose a temporary 90-day suspension of the tariffs. He pointed out that small and medium-size American businesses suffer from an inability to adapt to the tariffs on China overnight.He further suggested that during this period, the tariffs on Chinese imports be reduced to 10%.According to Ackman, this approach would effectively achieve the Trump administration’s stated goal of encouraging US businesses to relocate their supply chains away from China. However, he contends that this could be accomplished without the significant economic disruption and risks associated with the current high-tariff regime.","Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has publicly called for a three-month pause on the broad and steep reciprocal tariffs imposed on Chinese goods.

On Monday, April 14, an all-female crew including NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, astronaut Amanda Nguyen, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn, and celebrities Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry , and Kelly King will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all-female space mission. The historic flight, departing around 9:30 a.m. ET, marks a milestone for Jeff Bezos ’ company, with the crew wearing custom-designed astronaut suits by Monse.The suits, crafted from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, were tailored to each woman’s body using 3-D scans for a precise fit. Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it. Sánchez stressed the importance of functionality, recalling prototype tests where she stretched and bent to ensure durability, saying, “Let’s make sure it doesn’t split up the back in space.”The crew also shared their pre-flight glam plans with Elle. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” Sánchez said, noting they’ll wear lash extensions in the capsule. Perry, 40, added, “Space is going to finally be glam. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” King, 70, joined in the excitement for their stylish space debut.Announced in February 2025, the mission highlights a shift toward inclusivity in space exploration, with the crew’s custom suits symbolizing both innovation as well as empowerment.","An all-female crew will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all- female space mission.

The company has already awarded an average of $913.

Target: Does this vulnerability just impact Starlink user terminals and routers, or does it affect shared infrastructure like satellites and our centralized services? What does compromise of the target mean in the larger Starlink system?

Access Required: Is the vulnerability exploitable over the Internet? Is it exploitable over the local network? Is it only exploitable with physical access? Does it require other authentication or preconditions to be viable?

Access Gained: What access does the exploit grant to the target? Can it to be used to affect other users or the system overall? Would it allow an attacker to gather information about Starlink customers?

Scale: How hard would it be to exploit the vulnerability to affect many devices in the fleet?

Persistence: Does this exploit allow an attacker to gain access to the target and maintain it across reboots?

Elon Musk’s company SpaceX is giving up to $100,000 to security researchers to help test the safety of its satellite internet system, Starlink. The company shared this in a blog post, highlighting efforts to protect customer data and improve system security. Through its bug bounty program, SpaceX will pay researchers who find security problems in Starlink. So far, 43 bugs have been found. The average reward over the last three months is $913.75. “We encourage researchers to test Starlink for security issues in a non-disruptive way, and to report their findings through our bug bounty program,” the company said in the blog post.SpaceX says it checks the impact of each issue by looking at several key factors, such as how the bug works, what it affects, and how serious it could be.

Legacy Contracts Under Review

Trusted Sources Mandate

India’s Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has requested all telecom operators to submit details of Chinese equipment in their networks, as tensions rise in the US-China tariff war . “The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has written recently to all telcos ( Airtel Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea) to provide details of Chinese equipment in their networks,” a source told the Economic Times. The move aims to monitor potential security risks in India’s telecom infrastructure.According to Economic Times, the Centre has recently made it clear that it would not encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) from China, despite the tariff war between the two largest economies on the planet.Multiple sources indicate that the Indian government is tracking Chinese involvement in India’s communication networks to preempt vulnerabilities. Despite the tariff war potentially boosting India-China trade, the government has firmly stated it will not encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from China. This follows a similar DoT exercise last year to assess the prevalence of Chinese-linked SIM cards.Chinese vendors like Huawei and ZTE, barred from India’s 5G rollouts, continue to service portions of 4G infrastructure for Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and 2G networks of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL). “Huawei gets around Rs 600 crore from Indian telecom operators annually as maintenance charges,” another source told ET. While permitted to maintain existing equipment, these companies are excluded from new contracts.Since 2021, post the India-China border clash, the National Security Council Secretariat mandates that telecom suppliers be certified as “trusted sources.” Companies like Ericsson, Nokia, and Samsung have secured approvals, while Huawei and ZTE have not. “The share of Chinese firms is coming down…if any equipment needs to be replaced will depend on the details provided by the telcos,” an official noted.The government is not planning to replace existing Chinese equipment due to high costs for operators like Airtel and Vodafone Idea. However, with over 200 million subscribers still on 2G and some on 3G, older Chinese-chipped SIM cards may need future replacement. India is prioritizing local 4G and 5G technology development to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers and position itself as a telecom equipment exporter.","India’s Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has requested all telecom operators to submit details of Chinese equipment in their networks.

Suleyman suggests that the evolution of AI is going to work similar to that of the internet



Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recommends that young people experiment with artificial intelligence to prepare for a future where humans will develop ""symbiotic relationships"" with AI agents.""Play with these things,"" Suleyman said on the ""Big Technology"" podcast. ""Try them out, keep an open mind. Try everything that you possibly can with these models, and then you'll start to see their weaknesses as well.""The co-founder of Google DeepMind believes today's youth will inherit a dramatically changed workplace. ""Your day-to-day workflow just isn't going to look like this in 10 or 15 years time,"" he predicted. Future work will involve ""managing your AI agent, asking it to go do things, checking in on its quality, getting feedback, and getting into this symbiotic relationship.""Suleyman emphasized that people are too focused on AI's immediate applications while overlooking potential long-term impacts. He compared learning about AI to early internet adoption.""It's a little bit like saying, 'What should young people do when they get access to the internet for the first time?'"" Suleyman explained. ""Part of it is sort of obvious, where it's like — use it, experiment, try stuff out, do crazy things, make mistakes, get it wrong.""He noted that users, not creators, ultimately determine technology's development by discovering its best applications. ""The things that people choose to do with their phones, with the internet, with their laptops... are always way more inventive and surprising than anything you could possibly think of ahead of time,"" Suleyman said.His advice applies broadly, including to ""a 15-year-old who's in high school, thinking about what they do next in college or whatever, or whether or not they go to college.""Suleyman remains optimistic about AI's future, expecting innovation to accelerate as capabilities become ""really cheap — if not, like, zero marginal cost.""","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recommends young people experiment with artificial intelligence to prepare for a future where humans will develop ""symbiotic relationships"" with AI agents.

Trump announces national security trade probe into the semiconductor sector

US President Donald Trump has announced plans to unveil tariff rates on imported semiconductors within the coming week, indicating a potential restructuring of the electronics trade landscape.The development comes days after the Trump administration announced that it will exclude smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs imposed on China, suggesting the reprieve may be temporary.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump emphasised his desire to ""make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country,"" explaining the rationale behind the impending tariffs, as per news agency Reuters.“We wanted to uncomplicate it from a lot of other companies, because we want to make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country,” Trump told reporters.He also stressed the need for “flexibility” in applying the tariffs, hinting at potential exemptions for specific companies.Meanwhile, US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has announced that critical technology products from China, including smartphones and computers, will face new, distinct tariffs within the next two months, alongside those targeting semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.Lutnick clarified that these “special focus-type” tariffs would be separate from the recently increased reciprocal tariffs, which saw levies on Chinese imports rise to 125%.“He's saying they're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” he said in an interview. Lutnick predicted that these tariffs would incentivise the relocation of electronics production to the United States.Earlier in the day, the President announced a national security investigation into the semiconductor sector and the broader electronics supply chain .“We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,” he posted on social media.","US President Donald Trump has announced plans to unveil tariff rates on imported semiconductors within the coming week.

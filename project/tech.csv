America arrests tech company CTO and three others for exporting Nvidia's banned chips to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-company-cto-and-three-others-arrested-for-exporting-nvidia-chips-that-are-banned-to-china/articleshow/125511701.cms,"Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?





Two American citizens and two nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) -- all residing in the United States -- have been charged with a conspiracy to illegally export cutting-edge Nvidia Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which have artificial intelligence (AI) applications, to the PRC. John Eisenberg, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said in a press release. It further said that the Amercan government will also seek forfeiture of 50 Nvidia H200 GPUs that were intended to be exported unlawfully.Those arrested include Hon Ning Ho, aka “Mathew Ho,” an American citizen born in Hong Kong, 34, residing in Tampa, Florida; Brian Curtis Raymond, American citizen, 46, Huntsville, Alabama; Cham Li, aka “Tony Li,” PRC national, 38, San Leandro, California, and Jing Chen, aka “Harry Chen,” PRC national on F-1 nonimmigrant student visa, 45, Tampa, Florida. On November 19, 2025, Ho and Chen were arrested and appeared in court in the Middle District of Florida, while Raymond was arrested and appeared in the Northern District of Alabama.Raymond was briefly the chief technology officer (CTO) of the Virginia-based Corvex, which describes itself as an AI cloud computing company and is planning to go public. Corvex listed Raymond as its CTO and part of its leadership team in a press release on November 10.Corvex told CNBC yesterday that it “had no part in the activities cited in the Department of Justice’s indictment,” and that “the person in question is not an employee of Corvex. Previously a consultant to the company, he was transitioning into an employee role but that offer has been rescinded.”“The indictment unsealed yesterday alleges a deliberate and deceptive effort to transship controlled Nvidia GPUs to China by falsifying paperwork, creating fake contracts, and misleading U.S. authorities,” said John A. Eisenberg, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. “The National Security Division is committed to disrupting these kinds of black markets of sensitive U.S. technologies and holding accountable those who participate in this illicit trade. ”“As demonstrated by this indictment, the US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida is firmly committed to safeguarding our country’s national security,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory W. Kehoe for the Middle District of Florida. “Thanks to the dedicated investigative work by our law enforcement partners, these defendants who wrongfully exported this sensitive technology are facing justice.”According to the indictment, the PRC seeks to become the world leader in AI by 2030 and seeks to use AI for its military modernization efforts and in connection with the design and testing of weapons of mass destruction and deployment of advanced AI surveillance tools. The PRC seeks cutting-edge U.S. technology in furtherance of that goal, including Nvidia GPUs. To protect U.S. national security, beginning in October 2022, the Department of Commerce implemented new license requirements for the export of these technologies to the PRC.As alleged, from September 2023 to November 2025, Ho, Raymond, Li, and Chen conspired to violate these critical U. export controls, by illegally exporting advanced GPUs to the PRC through Malaysia and Thailand. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the conspirators used Janford Realtor, LLC—a Tampa, Florida-based company owned and controlled by Ho and Li—as a front to purchase and then illegally export controlled GPUs to the PRC. Despite its name, Janford Realtor, LLC, was never involved in any real estate transactions. Raymond, though his Alabama-based electronics company, supplied NVIDIA GPUs to Ho and others for illegal export to the PRC as part of the conspiracy.As further alleged in the indictment, the conspiracy encompassed four separate exports of Nvidia GPUs to the PRC. The first and second exports resulted in 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs being exported to the PRC between October 2024 and January 2025. The third and fourth exports to the PRC were disrupted by law enforcement and therefore not completed. These attempted exports related to ten Hewlett Packard Enterprises supercomputers containing Nvidia H100 GPUs and 50 separate Nvidia H200 GPUs.Despite knowing that licenses were required to export these items to the PRC, none of the conspirators ever sought or obtained a license for any of these exports. Instead, they lied about the intended destination of the GPUs to evade U.S. export controls. The indictment further alleges that the conspirators received over $3.89 million in wire transfers from the PRC to fund this unlawful scheme.",Two American citizens and two nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) -- all residing in the United States -- have been charged with a conspiracy to illegally export cutting-edge Nvidia Graphics Processing Units to the PRC.

""The strategic risk is two-sided. If OpenAI succeeds, it becomes a bigger competitive threat; but if the company underachieves internal targets, it may under-utilise its contracted compute, contributing to excess capacity and lower Cloud industry revenues,”

Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse

""We think the rational for adding OpenAI as a cloud customer could be threefold: 1) important to drive Cloud AI scale, and OpenAI would be able to find capacity elsewhere, 2) potential for deeper partnerships to bring OpenAI's frontier models onto Cloud platforms (though Microsoft deal dependent), 3) will be manageable exposure at less than 10% of total Cloud revs,""

How OpenAI can be a threat to the companies it's signing deals with





“All in, OpenAI is targeting $41bn in new product revenue by 2030 which likely includes advertising and eCommerce commissions, which would represent roughly 8% of our 2030 advertising/eCommerce commission industry forecasts,""

“Weighing the pros and cons, we still view OpenAI as a net competitive threat to Big Tech Internet, with the competitive risk across search, eCommerce, and enterprise AI outweighing modest cloud revenue risk (OpenAI less than 5% of AWS revs),”





Bank of America analyst Justin Post has warned that major technology companies face a dual threat as they rush to secure partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI . The analyst cautioned that these deals could damage cloud providers regardless of whether the Sam Altman-backed AI startup succeeds or fails. While the industry currently favours high capital expenditure and rapid deal-making, the investment bank analyst highlights the paradox of hyperscalers funding an entity that is simultaneously a partner and a competitor. Post claimed that investors must look beyond current spending trends to understand how these agreements reshape the market landscape.Post said to Business Insider. He said this, referering to deals worth billions of dollars that OpenAI has already inked with tech majors inclduing Microsoft, Google , Amazon Web Services, Oracle and others.Post explained.Post added that OpenAI expects to continue expanding and could eventually become a competitive challenge to major tech firms in both enterprise and consumer markets.This may include moving into areas such as advertising and agent-based transaction platforms that can complete tasks and make purchases for users.He noted that large hyperscalers are not the only companies that could face pressure as the startup grows. The bank’s analyst also believes that OpenAI will compete for marketing and advertising budgets, which could affect companies like Facebook parent Meta and Google’s YouTube.Post highlighted.He explained that partnerships with OpenAI have provided short-term benefits to some tech companies, including increases in stock prices. However, Post pointed out that the ChatGPT maker should still be viewed as a competitive threat.Post continued.",Bank of America analyst Justin Post has warned that major technology companies face a dual threat as they rush to secure partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this. If anyone is looking to grow, I'll have many recommendations for you!” he added.Netflix acquired Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022 as part of its effort to diversify revenue streams by building out its video game offerings, news agency Reuters reported.The studio was known for developing two games available on the platform: Netflix Stories and the highly successful Squid Game: Unleashed, which reportedly hit the number one spot in 26 countries.The streaming giant's move follows an earnings call earlier this week where Co-CEO Greg Peters specifically praised Squid Game: Unleashed as an example of the kind of narrative game the company wanted to create based on its original shows.However, the company, which named Alain Tascan as president of games last year, is implementing a new strategy that will focus on four specific categories: party, narrative, kids, and mainstream games, the report added. The studio’s closure signals a realignment of resources toward this updated focus.Despite the shutdown, Boss Fight's two games, Netflix Stories and Squid Game: Unleashed, will continue to be available on the Netflix platform.","Boss Fight Entertainment's co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Job and humanity at risk

Policy proposals and pushback

Employee ownership of companies

A reduced workweek

A potential robot tax on corporations to support displaced workers

Breaking up dominant AI firms like OpenAI to prevent excessive concentration of power





Senator Bernie Sanders has now issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the rise of artificial intelligence. In an interview with NBC News, Sanders said that the technology’s explosive growth risks concentrating wealth and power among a handful of billionaires while leaving ordinary workers behind. Sanders cautioned that AI’s military applications could reshape global conflict. “I think we are not all that far away from the development of robotic soldiers,” he said. “If you don’t have to worry about loss of life, and what you worry about is loss of robots, what does that mean for issues of war and peace globally? It’s a big issue.”The report further adds that Sanders linked the rise of AI to his long-standing concerns about wealth inequality. “The top 1% of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 93%. All of these zillionaires — the Musks, the Ellisons, the Bezoses, the Zuckerbergs — are investing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars into AI and robotics. What is the result of all that?”Along with this, Sanders has also warned that such investments could make the tech moguls even richer and more powerful politically, while weakening democracy and eroding living standards for working people.Same has Bill Gates, Sanders also echoed the warnings from tech leaders including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that AI could displace millions of jobs. “If I’m a factory worker today, if I’m working in an office, how am I going to feed my family? How am I going to pay the rent? Who is talking about that?”Sanders also raised concerns about AI’s impact on human relationships, noting that teenagers increasingly rely on AI companions. “If kids today have AI as their best friends… what kind of change does that mean for humanity?”Sanders also warned about the cooperation between AI companies and the U.S.military could erode privacy. “How far away are we from a small number of people having access to the email that you’ve sent out, every phone call that you’ve been on, really every aspect of your life? We’re not far.”Sanders has proposed measures to mitigate AI’s impact, including:He criticised venture capitalists and tech donors for funding super PACs to block regulation, likening their attitudes to monarchies of old.Sanders also mentioned that he will host a town hall with AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton at Georgetown University to discuss AI’s trajectory and its effects on workers. He urged Congress and the public to accelerate debate, “This ain’t just another technological revolution. It is a lot more profound, and it’s going to move a lot quicker.”","Senator Bernie Sanders has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the rise of artificial intelligence.

Deadly ends and costly risks ahead

Jobs and the human impact of AI





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates feels that every major technology company starting from chip makers like Nvidia to datacenter operators and other startups are grappling with the same pressing concern: whether there is an AI bubble in the world as billion of dollars are pouring into artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Gates acknowledged that the AI frenzy does resemble a bubble, but stressed it is fundamental different from historical speculative manias such as 17th-century tulip mania.“They were just tulips,” Gates said of the Dutch craze. By contrast, he described AI as “so profound and therefore its influence is hard to overstate.” Gates also likened today’s AI surge to the early days of the internet, where massive investment by transformative potential, even if many ventures failed along the way.For Gates, the biggest worry is not whether AI is a bubble, but how companies manage the inevitable failures, energy strains, and workforce disruptions while still harnessing AI’s transformative power.Bill Gates also pointed out on the immense economic and social value of AI as the technology offer medical advice, act as personalised tutors and accelerate drug design. He argued that this foundational potential makes financial commitments rational, even though “a ton of these investments will be dead ends.”Along with this, Bill Gates also highlighted some specific risks which keep the executives awake at night:Despite these challenges, Gates said opting out is not an option, “If you want to be a tech company, you don’t get to say, ‘No, let’s check out of this race.’”Apart from financial risks, Bill Gates also acknowledged two social pushbacks. He argued that smarter placement of data centers and next-generation solutions citing his nuclear energy venture Terrapower. “We don’t have permission to drive up people’s electricity costs,” he said.On the other hand, Gates also admitted AI will affect employment. “It’s only honest for people to speak frankly about the fact this will have a big effect on the job market,” he said, predicting impacts over the next several years.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates feels that every major technology company is grappling with the same pressing concern: whether there is an AI bubble.

Nvidia has delayed its GeForce Now cloud gaming service launch in India to Q1 2026, pushing back the November 2025 deadline. The company confirmed servers are actively being built within the country, a move that promises dramatically lower latency for Indian gamers when the service finally goes live.“Thanks for your continued excitement and patience while we work to bring GeForce NOW servers to this emerging gaming market. Servers are currently being built in India, and we now anticipate the service will go live during the first quarter of 2026,” Nvidia said in an emailed statement.Meanwhile, users can now register for launch updates on the official GeForce Now India page.The infrastructure buildout addresses cloud gaming's biggest pain point: lag. By housing servers on Indian soil rather than routing traffic through distant data centers, Nvidia is targeting seamless, high-fidelity streaming that can handle demanding AAA titles without the sluggish response times that plague overseas connections.This delay continues a pattern of missed deadlines. Nvidia first teased GeForce Now's India return at CES 2025 in January, promising availability in the first half of the year.By August's Gamescom, that shifted to ""later this year,"" then November, and now Q1 2026.The service arrives amid growing competition. Microsoft launched Xbox Cloud Gaming in India this month, though its ₹1,639 monthly Game Pass Ultimate price has drawn criticism. GeForce Now offers a different value proposition: stream games you already own from Steam or Epic Games Store, where aggressive regional pricing makes PC gaming more affordable in India.When it launches, GeForce Now will pack RTX 5080-powered hardware across three tiers. The Ultimate plan delivers 4K gaming at up to 240 FPS with eight-hour sessions, while Performance offers 1440p at 60 FPS for six hours. A free, ad-supported tier provides one-hour sessions at 1080p. Global pricing sits at $9 monthly for Performance and $19 for Ultimate, but Indian rates remain unannounced.Nvidia's cautious use of ""anticipate"" in official statements leaves room for further delays, though the physical infrastructure investment suggests genuine momentum toward launch.",N Nvidia delays launch of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service in India to Q1 2026.

You can’t …: Google CEO Sundar Pichai tells employees in all-hands meeting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/you-cant-rest-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-tells-employees-in-all-hands-meeting-says-2026-will-be-intense/articleshow/125502093.cms,"Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Pichai says company “better positioned” than competitors









Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivered a ‘caution’ to employees during a recent all-hands meeting, warning that 2026 will be an “intense” year marked by heightened competition in artificial intelligence (AI) and mounting pressure to satisfy cloud computing demand. Pichai told the gathering that the workers cannot rest on their laurels and that there’s a lot of work to be done in this competitive moment. During the gathering, Pichai also addressed growing concerns about a potential AI investment bubble, a topic that is being increasingly debated among Silicon Valley executives and Wall Street analysts as skepticism mounts over whether trillions of dollars in projected AI spending can be justified.“Amid significant AI investments and market talk of a potential AI bubble burst, how are we thinking about ensuring long-term sustainability and profitability if the AI market doesn't mature as expected?” Pichai read aloud a question posed by an employee. Pichai acknowledged the widespread nature of these concerns, stating, ""It's a great question. It's been definitely in the zeitgeist, people are talking about it.However, the CEO emphasised his longstanding position that failing to invest aggressively poses greater risks than overinvestment. He pointed to Google 's cloud division as evidence, which recently reported impressive 34% annual revenue growth, exceeding $15 billion in the latest quarter, with a backlog reaching $155 billion.“I think it's always difficult during these moments because the risk of underinvesting is pretty high,"" Pichai explained.“I actually think for how extraordinary the cloud numbers were, those numbers would have been much better if we had more compute,” he added.Pichai also reassured employees by highlighting Google's disciplined investment approach and strong financial foundation, suggesting the company could weather potential setbacks better than rivals.“We are better positioned to withstand, you know, misses, than other companies,” he said, referencing the strength of Google's underlying businesses.Looking toward the coming year, Pichai cautioned employees to expect volatility, noting there would be “no doubt ups and downs.”“It's a very competitive moment so, you can't rest on your laurels. We have a lot of hard work ahead but again, I think we are well positioned through this moment,"" the CEO warned.The remarks come as Google faces intensifying competition in the AI sector from rivals including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic. Recently, a report said that OpenAI CEO Sam Atlman told employees in a memo that Google’s success could “create some temporary economic headwinds for our company.”Recently, Pichai issued a stark warning on the AI bubble, saying that the tech giant sees “elements of irrationality” in the booming market and that ""no company is going to be immune"" if an Al bubble were to burst.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivered a ‘caution’ to employees during a recent all- hands meeting.

Airtel sends letter to Tata-owned Tejas Networks: Your equipment does not align with India's frequency plan resulting in ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-sends-letter-to-tata-owned-tejas-networks-your-equipment-does-not-align-with-indias-frequency-plan-resulting-in-/articleshow/125501201.cms,"Tejas Networks on Airtel letter





Bharti Airtel has reportedly lodged a formal complaint against Tata-owned Tejas Networks, alleging that the domestic vendor is using ""sub-standard equipment"" for BSNL’s 4G rollout, which is causing severe interference with Airtel’s network in Rajasthan. According to a report by The Economic Times (ET), Airtel sent a strongly worded letter to Tejas on November 14, claiming that the issue has been affecting its Quality of Service (QoS) since December of last year. The publication, which reviewed a copy of the letter, noted Airtel’s frustration that no corrective action has been taken despite ""repeated technical submissions, discussions, joint tests, and directives.""According to the report, the core of the dispute involves frequency interference. Tejas Networks is currently deploying an indigenous technology stack for state-run BSNL’s 4G network using the 800 MHz band. Airtel alleges this equipment is bleeding into its own 900 MHz spectrum. In the letter accessed by ET, Airtel stated: ""...seek an immediate action on continuing interference being caused to Airtel's 900 MHz network in the Rajasthan service area, as a direct consequence of the Tejas-manufactured sub-standard equipment, deployed by BSNL in the 800 MHz band.Airtel argues that the interference stems from a flaw in Tejas' filter design. The operator claims the filters are designed for the international frequency range of 864-894 MHz, whereas the 800 MHz downlink in India is strictly allocated between 869-889 MHz.""The current Tejas filter design, therefore, does not align with India's frequency plan, resulting in emissions beyond the allocated band,"" Airtel said in the report.Tejas Networks has reportedly rejected the allegations of non-compliance. In a statement given to The Economic Times, the company asserted that its equipment meets all 3GPP specifications and BSNL’s technical requirements regarding out-of-band emissions.Tejas attributed the issue to historical spectrum allocation rather than hardware failure. ""The problem in Rajasthan circle is due to an overlap of spectrum bands and is being addressed by additional filtering in consultation with DoT, Airtel and BSNL,"" the company told ET.This technical standoff occurs against the backdrop of the Indian government’s push for self-sufficiency in telecom. BSNL has been mandated to use equipment from local firms, with its 4G network being rolled out by a consortium including C-DoT, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and Tejas. The incident highlights the complexities of India's transition to using indigenous telecom gear, a move designed to reduce reliance on foreign vendors amid geopolitical uncertainties.","Bharti Airtel has reportedly lodged a formal complaint against Tata-owned Tejas Networks.

Airbnb has announced a significant leadership change within its executive ranks. Ari Balogh, the company’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), is set to step aside from his operational role this December. The announcement, made via an exchange filing on Friday, marks the conclusion of a seven-year tenure that saw the travel giant navigate a public listing, a global pandemic, and a massive resurgence in travel demand.While Balogh is leaving the C-suite, his departure will not be immediate. According to the filing, the former Google executive will remain with Airbnb in a non-executive advisory capacity through at least February 2026. This extended transition period suggests a focus on continuity and stability as the company searches for new technical leadership. So far, Airbnb has not named a successor, though a spokesperson confirmed that further details regarding the transition plans would be shared soon.Balogh joined Airbnb from Alphabet Inc.’s Google seven years ago, bringing deep technical expertise to the platform during a critical growth phase.His leadership over the engineering teams helped stabilize and scale the platform's infrastructure, allowing it to handle millions of concurrent users and the complex logistics of a two-sided marketplace. His tenure is said to have covered the company's volatile journey through the COVID-19 crisis, where the platform had to rapidly adapt its algorithms and policies to suit a world of remote work and long-term stays.The search for Balogh’s replacement comes at a pivotal moment for Airbnb. Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky has been vocal about the company’s intention to evolve beyond its core identity as a short-term rental service. After spending the last few years refining the basics -- improving customer service, pricing transparency, and host reliability -- Chesky declared earlier this year that the company is ready to expand.This expansion relies heavily on advanced technology. In May, Airbnb began rolling out hotel-inspired amenities and add-on services, signaling a direct challenge to the traditional hospitality sector. Recently, vacation rental company Airbnb said that it will invest in the promotion of inland towns across Spain over the next three years to tap into rural tourism, as major cities restrict short-term rentals in the world's second-most visited country after France.This comes as cities such as Barcelona plan to ban all short-term rentals by 2028, while destinations including the Balearic Islands and Madrid have demanded platforms cut listings under new regulations. Airbnb said rural destinations in Spain attracted fewer visitors than those in France and Britain, and only half as many as Italy. But the platform expects interest to increase ahead of the 2026 solar eclipse, which will be visible from several rural areas in Spain.","Ari Balogh, the company’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), is set to step aside from his operational role this December.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Why is the US concerned about providing China with Nvidia’s advanced AI chips





""great guy""





The US is reportedly considering allowing Nvidia to sell its H200 AI chips in China. A report by the news agency Reuters cited sources familiar with the matter to claim that his potential policy change follows a recent bilateral agreement between the US and China. The Commerce Department, which manages US export controls, is reviewing a change to its existing policy that prohibits the sale of such advanced chips to China. However, the report citing sources warned that these plans could be altered.A White House official declined to comment to Reuters on the matter but stated,Nvidia also did not comment directly on the review. Still, the company noted that current regulations prevent it from offering a competitive AI data centre chip in China, leaving that large market open to foreign competitors.The potential lifting of the ban suggests a friendlier approach to China following the trade and technology truce brokered last month by US President Donald Trump and Chinese premier Xi Jinping in Busan, the Reuters report added.China-focused lawmakers in Washington worry that sending more advanced AI chips to China could strengthen Beijing’s military. This concern led the Biden administration to place limits on such exports.In response to China’s assertive use of export controls on rare earth minerals, which are essential to many technologies, Trump threatened new restrictions on tech shipments to China earlier this year. However, most of those measures were later rolled back.The H200 chip, introduced two years ago, has more high-bandwidth memory than the earlier H100, enabling it to handle data faster. It is estimated to offer roughly twice the performance of Nvidia’s H20 chip, which is currently the most advanced AI semiconductor permitted for export to China after the Trump administration reversed a brief ban on those sales.Earlier this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whom Trump has referred to as a, visited the White House during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s trip.This week, the US Commerce Department also said it has approved shipments of up to 70,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips, the company’s next-generation AI model, to Saudi Arabia’s Humain and to G42 in the United Arab Emirates.","The US is reportedly considering allowing Nvidia to sell its H200 AI chips in China.

'Direct Digital Access' that has created anxiety

Wider geopolitical concerns





Europe is worrying big about its Buses and the reason is China. Anxiety over reliance on Chinese technology has permeated the typically serene infrastructure of Scandinavian public transportation, with operators in Denmark and Norway launching urgent investigations into potential security vulnerabilities in their fleets. As reported by NBC News, European officials are increasingly concerned that Chinese-built infrastructure could be weaponized in the event of geopolitical conflict, potentially allowing foreign actors to immobilize or tamper with vehicles remotely.The focus of the alarm is Yutong, a Zhengzhou-based company and the world’s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume. Public transit providers in Denmark and Norway say they are moving to remedy a ""security loophole"" linked to the buses' ""over-the-air"" software capabilities. Jeppe Gaard, the chief operating officer of Danish transport provider Movia, told NBC News regarding the vulnerability: “Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests ‘over the air,’ they can be stopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker. ”Movia, which operates 262 Yutong buses across Copenhagen and eastern Denmark, warned that this issue extends beyond a single manufacturer. “Electric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,” Gaard told NBC News.“It is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in.”The issue was first highlighted earlier this month by Ruter, a Norwegian operator responsible for half of the country’s public transport. In a series of tests performed “inside a mountain,” Ruter compared Yutong buses against those from Dutch manufacturer VDL.While the Dutch buses lacked the capability for autonomous software updates, Ruter found that Yutong “has direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics.” The operator concluded that, in theory, the buses could be “stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer.”In response to inquiries about the Scandinavian investigations, Yutong stated that it “strictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.” The company noted that its data for the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services center in Frankfurt, Germany, protected by encryption.The bus controversy arrives amidst a broader European reckoning with Chinese technology. Following pressure from Washington, several European nations have already stripped Huawei and ZTE equipment from their 5G networks due to espionage fears. Intelligence officials worry that the threat profile for electric vehicles (EVs) mirrors that of telecommunications.Richard Dearlove, the former head of Britain’s MI6 intelligence agency, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year that the West is facing “a similar problem in Chinese electric cars” to the one it faced with Huawei. “They can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,” Dearlove told NBC. “So if we have a crisis with China, they can bring London to a complete halt by reprogramming” the vehicles.However, cybersecurity experts note that this vulnerability is inherent to modern ""connected"" vehicles, regardless of origin. Ken Munro, founder of Pen Test Partners, pointed out that brands like Tesla have similar capabilities. While Ruter has implemented new firewalls and stricter controls, Munro expressed skepticism about whether technical fixes can fully mitigate the risk without removing connectivity entirely.Ultimately, Munro argued, the issue is one of geopolitical intent. While he believes the chances of China sabotaging its own export economy are “incredibly small,” he added: “It just comes down to trust.”","Public transit providers in Denmark and Norway say they are moving to remedy a ""security loophole"" linked to the buses' ""over-the-air"" software capabilities.

Big New Addition: ESPN Unlimited

How to Add ESPN Unlimited With a YouTube TV Subscription

Users report access issues





YouTube TV and Disney recently reached a new carriage agreement that restores ESPN, ABC and dozens of Disney-owned channels to the live TV streaming platform after a two-week blackout. The deal also includes a major upgrade for subscribers: Free access to ESPN Unlimited, Disney’s new all-in-one sports streaming service. The dispute had left millions of subscribers without access to popular Disney channels, including ABC, ESPN, The Disney Channel, FX, and Nat Geo.“We’re happy to share that we’ve reached a deal to continue carrying Disney content. We appreciated your patience while we negotiated on your behalf. Any recordings that were previously in your library and your personal preferences/recommendations will be just as you left them. We’ll be launching your local ABC stations as quickly as we can, and they should be accessible shortly,” reads the notice on YouTube TV Help page.ESPN Unlimited bundles every ESPN linear network, ESPN on ABC broadcasts, ESPN+ programming and WWE Premium Live Events into a single platform — essentially everything ESPN offers, with the exception of MLB.tv.The service normally costs $29.99 per month when purchased directly, with a current promotion offering Disney+ (with ads) and Hulu (with ads) at no additional charge for 12 months.Under the new agreement, YouTube TV now joins cable, satellite and other pay-TV providers permitted to include ESPN Unlimited free of charge with a subscription — a notable change given that the service previously required separate authentication for YouTube TV customers.For sports and pro-wrestling fans, the addition is meaningful: while YouTube TV already carried ESPN’s linear channels, ESPN+ content and WWE’s monthly premium events were not included.Disney has not completed the full rollout, but once access is enabled, YouTube TV subscribers will be able to activate ESPN Unlimited using the standard TV-provider login flow. The steps are expected to work as follows:* Go to the ESPN Unlimited app or website.* Select “Log In” or “Sign In With TV Provider.”* Choose “YouTube TV” from the list of providers.* Sign in using your Google account linked to your YouTube TV subscription.* Confirm activation inside the ESPN Unlimited app.If your account is eligible, authentication should unlock the full ESPN Unlimited catalog, including ESPN+, live linear feeds and WWE Premium Live Events.Despite the announcement, ESPN Unlimited is not yet live for most YouTube TV customers. Reports also suggest that Xfinity users — who were already supposed to have ESPN Unlimited access — are facing similar authentication issues. Disney has not provided a timetable for when the rollout will be fully operational. YouTube TV has said it will notify subscribers as soon as ESPN Unlimited access becomes available.","YouTube TV and Disney reached a new carriage agreement that restores ESPN, ABC and dozens of Disney-owned channels to the live TV streaming platform after a two-week blackout.

SpaceX Starship Bursts Into Flames; Disastrous Test Caught On Cam | Watch Viral Video





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos 's rocket company, Blue Origin, is moving to challenge Elon Musk ’s SpaceX 's launch vehicle offerings by developing a super heavy-class rocket called the New Glenn 9×4. The company plans to build this vehicle in addition to upgrading its current rocket. In a recent blog post, Blue Origin said,The new rocket, named after the first American to orbit Earth, will feature nine engines on its first stage and four on its second. The current New Glenn, which has four fewer engines, will now be known as the 7×2. In a post on the social media platform X, Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp shared a photo of the latest New Glenn model, showcasing the size difference compared to the older model.The New Glenn 9×4 will be capable of delivering more than 70 metric tons of payload to low Earth orbit, an increase from the 45 metric tons carried by the current New Glenn vehicle (which is classified as a heavy-lift vehicle).This new capacity positions it to better compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, which can bring 64 metric tons into orbit, and its Starship vehicle, which is designed to carry 100 metric tons and is still undergoing testing.Blue Origin noted that both the 9×4 and 7×2 vehiclesThey will be utilised for missions including lunar exploration, launchingof satellites and national security purposes such as the US Golden Dome project.The update to New Glenn comes a week after Blue Origin’s second successful launch. The 7×2 model will receive several upgrades, including improved engines, which Blue Origin says will boost payload performance and reliability and support more frequent launches.The reusable first-stage booster from New Glenn’s second launch was also returned for refurbishment this week. Soon after Blue Origin released its updated vehicle roadmap, SpaceX said its third-generation Super Heavy booster for Starship has begun prelaunch testing.Blue Origin is competing not only with SpaceX but also with companies like Rocket Lab Corp., which are developing rockets capable of carrying large groups of satellites into orbit. Blue Origin is also seeking a role in NASA’s Artemis III mission.Both Blue Origin and SpaceX have submitted proposals to build the lunar lander intended to return astronauts to the moon. The project was initially awarded to SpaceX, but the $2.9 billion contract was reopened after NASA raised concerns about delays in the Starship-based design.According to Politico, SpaceX has shifted the planned launch date from mid-2027 to September 2028, based on internal company documents. Blue Origin already has a $3.4 billion contract for a lander for the Artemis V mission, scheduled for 2029. This week, the company also revealed an aerobrake designed to slow and protect payloads during their return to Earth.","The New Glenn 9×4 will be capable of delivering more than 70 metric tons of payload to low Earth orbit.

Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw , has issued a stern warning to social media platforms such as Meta and YouTube , stating they must take responsibility for the content published on their sites amidst a global crisis of trust fueled by deepfake and AI-generated material. Speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, Vaishnaw stressed that platforms must respect the social structures and laws of the countries in which they operate.“Everyone is worried over the significant influence social media is having on trust between institutions and society,” the minister said, as per a report by The Economic Times.“Trust is getting absolutely broken because of deep fakes, because of synthetic material which is floating around, because of rumours which get amplified at the speed of light,” the minister added.The minister delivered a clear message regarding platforms' responsibility for content moderation and community guidelines. He emphasised that platforms must account for India’s diverse societal norms to be successful.“Social media platforms must understand that to be successful. Otherwise there will be stronger regulations,” Vaishnaw cautioned.These comments come on the heels of recent government actions, including instructing platforms to label AI-generated content and notifying the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) rules, which established a national framework for personal data processing.Addressing the global debate over regulating social media, Vaishnaw clarified that India is pursuing a “techno-legal approach,” rather than adopting the prescriptive rules-based model favoured by the European Union or the free-market approach of the US.“We have decided to go for a principles based law, and defined the principles,” he explained, adding, “We believe in a combination of innovation and regulation, in which our bias is more towards innovation.”","Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, has issued a stern warning to social media platforms such as Meta and YouTube. He stressed that platforms must respect the social structures and laws of the countries in which they operate.“Everyone is worried over the significant influence social media is having on trust between institutions and society,” the minister said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125490129,imgsize-29664,width-400,resizemode-4/ashwini-vaishnaw.jpg"

“only meaningful effort this agency has advanced”

“Handshake agreements without teeth will not stop state-sponsored hackers in their quest to infiltrate our networks. They won’t prevent the next breach. They do not ensure that the weakest link in the chain is strengthened. If voluntary cooperation were enough, we would not be sitting here today in the wake of Salt Typhoon,”

What senior US lawmakers said about FCC’s decision

“basic cybersecurity safeguards”

“leave the American people exposed.”

“prescriptive and counterproductive regulations.”





The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has reportedly voted to eliminate rules that mandated US phone and internet companies to meet minimum cybersecurity requirements. The repealed regulations required telecommunications carriers toAccording to a report by TechCrunch, the rules implemented by the Biden administration in January were withdrawn by the FCC after two commissioners appointed by US President Donald Trump , Chairman Brendan Carr and Olivia Trusty, voted to eliminate them. However, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez criticised the decision, calling the rules thesince the discovery of a sweeping hacking campaign, the report added. Gomez also noted that cooperation with the telecommunications industry is valuable for cybersecurity, but it is not enough on its own.Gomez added.The hacking campaign, attributed to the China-backed group Salt Typhoon cybercrime group, involved exposing over 200 US phone and internet companies, including AT&T, Verizon and Lumen. The multi-year hacking operation conducted broad-scale surveillance of American officials. In some instances, the hackers targeted wiretap systems that telcos were required to install for law enforcement access.The report also notes that the FCC’s decision to revise the rules drew criticism from senior US lawmakers, including Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Peters said he wasby the FCC’s attempt to undoand cautioned that the change willIn a statement, Sen.

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

Gaming, ads, and experimental units also hit

Lord of the Rings





Amazon announced last month that it is cutting around 14,000 corporate jobs. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti shared a blog post announcing the job cuts. In the post, Galetti said the company is making ""organizational changes across Amazon” that will result in an “overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles”. However, some newly filed documents recently revealed that engineers bore the brunt of the cuts. As reported by CNBC, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings in New York, California, New Jersey and Washington show that nearly 40% of the more than 4,700 job cuts in those states were engineering roles, disproportionately affecting mid-level software engineers (SDE II). The filings represent only part of the total layoffs announced in October, as reporting requirements vary by state.As per the report, the job cuts mark the largest layoff round in Amazon’s history, aligning the company with other tech giants that have slashed jobs despite strong profits. As reported by Layoffs.fyi, nearly 113,000 jobs have been cut across 231 tech companies in 2025, continuing a post-pandemic trend of belt-tightening.Amazon insists AI was not the main cause for the layoffs, the company is shifting resources toward artificial intelligence. Jassy has predicted that corporate headcount will shrink in coming years as efficiency gains from AI take hold. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been pushing to reshape Amazon’s culture into what he calls “the world’s largest startup,” urging teams to operate leaner and faster by cutting layers of bureaucracy. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Jassy said while speaking at the company’s quarterly earnings call. “It really — it's culture,” he added.“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained during the earnings call.The WARN filling also showed significant cuts in other division as well. The layoffs impacted Game designers, artists, and producers made up over a quarter of layoffs in Irvine and 11% in San Diego. Amazon is halting much of its work on big-budget MMO titles, including a plannedgame.Also units behind Amazon Lens and Lens Live were heavily impacted, particularly in Palo Alto. More than 140 ad sales and marketing roles were eliminated in New York, about 20% of the 760 positions cut there.Over 500 roles were eliminated, representing more than 10% of total cuts.","Amazon announced last month that it is cutting around 14,000 corporate jobs.

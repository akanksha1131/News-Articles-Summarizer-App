Salesforce too hit by Saks bankruptcy



What went wrong with Saks







Amazon is very upset with luxury retailer Saks Global. The ecommerce giant Amazon is pushing back against Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan. Saks Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection recently. Amazon has warned that it may seek ""more drastic measures"" if Saks doesn't ""resolve"" its concerns. Saks is the owner of department stores Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman. The e-commerce giant invested $475 million of preferred equity in Saks Global in December 2025. As per court filing, Amazon invested the $475 million into Saks as it finalized its acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group in a $2.7 billion deal.Amazon says its stake in Saks is now ""presumptively worthless"". The company has asked a federal judge to reject the retailer's bankruptcy financing plans, reason being that it will further diminish its chances of recovery. ""That equity investment is now presumptively worthless after Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners,"" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a court filing, just hours after Saks Global filed for Chapter 11 with a $1.75 billion financing package.Amazon has filed the motion in Texas federal bankruptcy court. The company says that it ""hopes"" Saks will ""resolve"" its concerns, but warned that it may be forced to ""seek more drastic remedies,"" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. In court filings, Amazon said the financing would ""saddle"" Saks with ""billions of dollars of obligation for no material benefit"" and improperly use the value of Saks Global's flagship entities to prop up other debtors at the expense of their creditors, including Amazon.Saks reportedly has been running out of cash and struggling to pay its bills since its acquisition of Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in 2024.Software giant Salesforce too holds a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but the company has a smaller stake than Amazon.Though Saks caters to some of the richest shoppers in the world, the luxury retailer has been steadily running out of cash and failing to pay some of its bills after it acquired its longtime rival Neiman Marcus in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal heavily financed with debt.","Saks Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection recently.

"The 'Lufthansa reason' that Ryanair CEO, who called Elon Musk idiot, gave for not using Starlink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-lufthansa-reason-that-ryanair-ceo-who-called-elon-musk-idiot-gave-for-not-using-starlink/articleshow/126712548.cms,"Why Ryanair CEO doesn’t think its customers need wi-fi on plane and what Musk said







The ‘war of words’ between Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and tech billionaire Elon Musk escalated over the weekend after both the leaders called each other ‘idiot’. The reason for this online feud: Ryanair’s refusal to invest in Starlink like its rival Lufthansa has and Tesla CEO saying that the airlines will lose customers if they don’t give Wi-Fi on planes. O’Leary flatly rejected Starlink service for which company rivals are racing to install across their fleets, citing a “2% fuel penalty” that he refuses to pass on to travelers. Notably, Ryanair is a short-distance airline for budget-conscious customers, with fares starting from 15 pounds.It all started on last week when O’Leary dismissed the idea of having internet on-board, citing the impact of fuel costs from drag caused by the antenna and the short length of its flights. O’Leary’s primary justification for rejecting Starlink is rooted in the physics of flight, specifically, the drag created by the satellite antenna.“You need to put antenna on fuselage it comes with a 2% fuel penalty because of the weight and drag. We don't think our passengers are willing to pay for WiFi for an average 1-hour flight,” Ryanair CEO told news agency Reuters.This was shared by Tesla investor Sawyer Merritt, to which Musk replied, “They [Ryanair] will lose customers to airlines that do have Internet.”The rebuttal came quickly and O’Leary calls Musk idiot. For an airline that operates a fleet of over 640 aircraft and carried 206 million passengers last year, O'Leary estimates this would cost the company between $200 million and $250 million annually.“What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero. We have to put an aerial antenna on top of the aircraft. It would cost us about $200-$250 million a year. In other words, an extra dollar for every passenger we fly. And the reality for us is we can't afford those costs. Passengers won't pay for internet or internet usage. If it's free, they'll use it. But they won't pay one euro each to use the internet. So, we're not putting it on board. And I frankly wouldn't pay any attention to anything that Elon Musk puts on that cesspit of his called X. He was the guy who advocated getting Donald Trump elected,” O’Leary said.Musk fired back on X (formerly Twitter), labeling O'Leary an “utter idiot” and calling for his termination.",Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and tech billionaire Elon Musk called each other ‘idiot’ The reason for this online feud: Ryanair’s refusal to invest in Starlink like its rival Lufthansa has and Tesla CEO saying that the airlines will lose customers if they don’t give Wi-Fi on planes.

What the company said about the new feature

“Price Trends marks the first step in Cleartrip’s larger pricing intelligence roadmap. We have built it based on a simple idea that ‘transparency creates trust.’ By combining historical data with trend analysis, we are giving travellers a clear, actionable view of pricing, rather than leaving them to speculate.

As we continue to strengthen this, we will also layer in smarter alerts, deeper insights and predictive capabilities powered by AI that proactively help travellers stay ahead of price movements and make the right booking decision at the right time.

”

“We know that for most travellers, the 'book now or wait' dilemma is a huge source of anxiety. With Price Trends, we’re taking the guesswork out of the equation. Instead of forcing people to manually track fares and stress over price jumps, we’re giving them a clear, data-backed signal right on the app. This kind of contextual intelligence significantly improves confidence, making the booking experience feel less like a gamble and more like a well-informed decision.

”





Cleartrip launched a Price Trends service that will allow customers to make informed decisions while booking flights by looking at past prices and trends in prices for flights they want. The Flipkart-owned online travel platform introduced the feature to address the uncertainty travellers face about whether flight prices will rise or fall. Price Trends replaces guesswork with data, helping users make flight booking decisions with greater confidence.Questions about flight prices, like when to book, concerns about price drops, or fear of prices going up right after booking, remain a significant source of stress for travellers. This constant uncertainty often takes away from the enjoyment of planning a trip.Cleartrip's 'Price Trends' removes this uncertainty by analysing recent pricing patterns for specific routes and dates. It shows whether the current fare is lower or typical, along with the price difference, helping travellers make faster, more confident booking decisions.Cleartrip is working to address the fare-related concerns that often affect the travel experience. Building on this, the next phase will include the launch of anto provide more certainty and help travellers stay ahead of price increases.This upcoming feature aims to help travellers better understand fare movements and choose the right time to book.Commenting on the launch of the new feature, Manoj Awasthi, Chief Technology & Product Officer, Cleartrip, said,Arnav Sharma, Group Product Manager at Cleartrip, added,","Flipkart-owned online travel platform introduced the feature to address the uncertainty travellers face about whether flight prices will rise or fall.

The New York Times’ Wordle continues to sit quietly inside many people’s daily routines. It rarely takes more than a few minutes, but it asks for full attention while it lasts. Each puzzle offers the same simple task: find a five letter word using no more than six guesses. The appeal comes from its limits. There is only one puzzle a day, and no way to rush ahead. Some days move quickly. Others resist.Wordle #1672 is one of the more deceptive entries. At first glance, it appears manageable, but early guesses can lead in unhelpful directions. Familiar patterns do not settle easily. If progress feels slow, the hints below are designed to narrow the field without giving everything away. The answer appears later for those who want closure or prefer to reset for tomorrow.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1672 on January 16, 2026, is:Meaning: A person who participates in a raceWhether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction. He also warned the CEOs against indiscriminately sharing proprietary work online, noting that web-scraping chatbots could inadvertently absorb and lead sensitive data. Protecting intellectual property, he said, must be a top priority in the AI era.Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations. He pointed out that businesses often underestimate the potential risk of falling behind.Along with this, he also urged the leaders to adopt AI strategically and combine technological foresight with strong governance and data protection.Recently, Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”",Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations.

How Google founders 'dumping' California 'looks similar' to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leaving the city he called 'his home' for 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-founders-dumping-california-looks-similar-to-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-leaving-the-city-he-called-his-home-for-30-years/articleshow/126498943.cms,"Jeff Bezos often points out that long-term success comes from staying committed to an idea while remaining open to changing the approach.

When Jeff Bezos left Seattle

What is California’s Billionaire's tax





It's almost official that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have cut ties with California. The two Google Guys have reportedly said Bye to California; joining the billionaires who have left the state, shifting businesses and houses. Page is worth around $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million. The report quotes people familiar with the situation Google co-founder Sergey Brin is also said to be in discussions to purchase a Miami home, according to people familiar with the situation.Some analysts have termed Google founders' move to leave California strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos ’ relocation playbook. According to them, the timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look quite like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But the big difference here is that Jeff Bezos did not leave California. Amazon founder left Seattle, the city where he started the online bookseller that grew into the global tech giant, Amazon.In 2024, Bezos announced on Instagram that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said that the move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. In his Instagram post, Bezos called Seattle his home since 1994.However, the timing, as some analysts pointed out, also suggested another reason: Taxes. In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. As Washington state does not have a personal income tax, so the new levy marked the first time that Bezos would face state taxes on his stock sales. As reported by CNBC, in 2022, when the Washington state's Capital gains tax took effect, Bezos stopped selling. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of that year.After his move to Miami, Bezos reportedly made up for lost time. Quoting an SEC filing, the report says that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before January 31, 2025. And since Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains, so on the $2 billion sale that Bezos made, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state. On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he saved more than at least 600 million.California’s proposed ballot initiative has been proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

Mustafa Suleyman outlines a future of deeply personal AI



“In five years’ time, everybody will have their own AI companion who knows them so intimately and so personally that they will come to live life alongside you.”

Mixed reactions on social media





AI has slowly but surely made its way from labs and offices into our daily lives. It now runs search engines, smartphones, navigation tools, and work software. The head of AI at Microsoft says that the next step could be a lot more personal. Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, says that in the next five years, most people will have their own AI helper that knows them well and helps them with their daily tasks. Unlike today's chatbots and digital assistants, these systems wouldn't just do what you tell them to. They would also learn from what their users do, where they are, what they like, and what they want to do.Suleyman's comments, which have been shared a lot on social media, have gotten a lot of people in the tech community talking about how quickly AI is changing and how deeply it might become a part of people's daily lives. His vision is of a future where AI doesn't just work on screens, but also in real time, seeing, hearing, and understanding the world like its user does. The idea makes people worry about privacy, control, and relying on technology for a long time. But it also shows that the AI industry is moving toward systems that are more personalized and aware of their surroundings, which can help people with more than just automating tasks.User slow_developer posted the comments on X (formerly Twitter) and quoted Suleyman's vision for AI in the near future. Suleyman said,He also said that this type of AI system would be able to see and hear what its user sees and hears, as well as understand their situation, preferences, and reasons for doing things. Suleyman says that the experience would be like having a friend or helper who is always there to help people make big decisions and deal with problems that come up every day.Suleyman didn't give any specific technical details or product timelines, but the statement shows that the tech industry is still working toward AI systems that are more flexible and tailored to individual needs than the ones we have now.A lot of people on social media had different things to say about the comments. Some people thought that the five-year time frame might be too short because generative AI and wearable tech are growing so quickly. Some people were worried about how these kinds of friends would act in real life.A user asked about the day-to-day logistics and said that if the system were always on, it would probably need to be charged a lot and have its hardware or software updated regularly. Another user thought that the five-year estimate meant that big improvements in AI companionship might take a long time. One person was worried about how AI systems would work together and said they shouldn't have too many rules about how they can talk to each other.As AI becomes more common in everyday life, these answers show how people are talking about the trade-offs between cost, usability, control, and innovation.","Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, says that in the next five years, most people will have their own AI helper that knows them well and helps them with their daily tasks.

This format, already a billion-dollar industry, offers binge-worthy romance and melodrama for free, unlike competitors. With ByteDance's experience in Asia and TikTok's mastery of short-form content, PineDrama aims to capture a massive audience, potentially succeeding where other short-form ventures have faltered.

A billion-dollar format gaining steam

Can TikTok succeed where Quibi failed?





TikTok has quietly dropped a new app called PineDrama, and it's betting big on a format that's been quietly minting money: micro-dramas. Available now in the US and Brazil, the app serves up serialized shows in vertical, one-minute episodes.The setup feels familiar. You scroll through a feed, but instead of random TikToks, every video is part of a show. Titles like ""Love at First Bite"" and ""The Officer Fell For Me"" lean heavily into romance and melodrama, the kind of guilty-pleasure stuff that's easy to binge. Some shows have already crossed 100 million views, according to Business Insider. Right now, everything's free and ad-free, which makes it stand out from competitors like DramaBox and ReelShort that charge upwards of $20 a week after the first few episodes.Micro-dramas might sound niche, but the numbers tell a different story. The format pulled in $1.3 billion in the US last year alone, mostly from viewers willing to pay to keep watching. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, already runs several micro-drama apps in Asia, so this isn't exactly uncharted territory. PineDrama builds on TikTok Minis, a section the company added to its main app late last year.Short-form storytelling has had its share of failures. Quibi famously raised $1.75 billion, promised Hollywood-quality episodes under 10 minutes, and folded within eight months. But TikTok isn't trying to recreate prestige TV. It's leaning into low-budget, high-drama stories that grab attention fast and keep it with cliffhangers. With Disney and other major players eyeing vertical video, the race to dominate this space is heating up. TikTok's already proven it understands short-form content better than anyone. PineDrama is the next test.","TikTok has launched PineDrama, a new app featuring one-minute, vertical episodes of micro-dramas.

A Meta product manager with no technical background has revealed how artificial intelligence-powered coding tools have transformed his work. In a recent episode ofZevi Arnovitz said that discovering AI coding tools in mid-2024 marked a turning point in his career. He noted that these AI tools gave him what he callsdespite finding codingUnderstanding how to use AI intentionally ishe said, referring to product management. According to his LinkedIn profile, Arnovitz joined Meta in September 2025 after spending about three years as a product manager at website-building company Wix. Despite his lack of technical training, he credited vibe coding, which uses AI tools to write and understand code, with expanding what he can accomplish in his role.Arnovitz explained how he has rebuilt his workflow around AI. He uses vibe coding tools like Cursor alongside models from Anthropic and Google to explore product ideas, create build plans, write code, review it, and update documentation.The change has reshaped his role as a product manager. Instead of just coordinating between engineering and design teams, Arnovitz now works more like a product owner who can actually build things himself.he noted.Still, Arnovitz said there are limits to what non-technical product managers should take on. However, he noted that he doesn't think product managers should be shipping complex infrastructure changes or big projects.AI has enabled product managers to handle smaller UI projects by building the feature, then giving the code to a developer for final review and completion, he added.As AI tools improve, Arnovitz said job titles and responsibilities are likely to “collapse”, and product managers should treat vibe coding as awith their engineering teams.The rise of AI coding tools is blurring the lines between traditional roles, making it easier for non-technical workers, including product managers, to build products directly.On an earlierepisode from October 2025, Figma CEO Dylan Field said that AI has encouraged many workers to try building products themselves. Tasks that once required deep engineering knowledge can now be done with vibe coding tools, he said.Field mentioned.he added.That same thinking is appearing in how companies train new employees.

How Elon Musk's Tesla may become a 'winner' in Canada PM Mark Carney's 'welcome note' to Chinese auto industry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-elon-musks-tesla-may-become-a-winner-in-canada-pm-mark-carneys-welcome-note-to-chinese-auto-industry/articleshow/126690491.cms,"Canada is lifting 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, allowing 49,000 imports annually. This move could significantly benefit Tesla, which previously shipped from China. However, a price cap on half the quota might favor Chinese brands like BYD and Nio, offering more affordable options for Canadian buyers.

How Canada’s Chinese EV policy change can help Elon Musk’s Tesla

Elon Musk Can ‘CRY’, But He Will Still Pay $140,000,000 X Fine: EU Adamant After Hitler Attack

“This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,”

“Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any market to achieve the best cost efficiency,""

How the price clause in Canada’s new EV policy is ‘good news’ for Chinese brands





Canada has decided to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. According to a Reuters report, this policy change could benefit Elon Musk's Tesla, which is positioned to be among the first electric carmakers to take advantage of the new arrangement. Under the deal announced last week, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually from China, with a 6.1% tariff on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently visited China, also said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.The Reuters report cited experts who claimed that Tesla's early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant to Canada and its established sales network in the country give the company an advantage. However, under one of the clauses in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles priced under 35,000 CAD (roughly $25,000). It's important to note that Tesla model prices are all above that number, and this could limit the company's ability to fully utilise the quota.While many Chinese automakers are eager to take advantage of this opportunity as they increase exports, Tesla has a head start. In 2023, the company already set up its Shanghai plant, which is its largest and most cost-effective factory worldwide, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.The US automaker started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada that same year, increasing Canadian automobile imports from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.However, Tesla was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its US and Berlin factories after Canada imposed 100% tariffs, saying they wanted to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.Currently, Tesla ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants, such as cheaper Model 3s, are mostly built in China.Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions told Reuters.Tesla has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, while Chinese competitors such as BYD and Nio do not yet have a sales presence there. Tesla can also likely move faster with marketing plans since it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors, the report adds.Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight, told Reuters.Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo and Polestar, which are both owned by China's automaking group Geely.However, the price limit will likely give Chinese brands some room to compete with Tesla.“The beneficiaries are likely to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,” Fiorani added.John Zeng, head of market forecast for China at London-based consultancy GlobalData, said that the quota would also likely give Chinese carmakers a chance to test the market in Canada, where there's a large Chinese Canadian population.Canada wants to explore joint ventures and investments with Chinese companies within the next three years to build a Canadian electric vehicle using Chinese expertise, the public broadcaster CBC reported, citing a senior Canadian official.China's top EV maker, BYD, currently has an electric bus assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.Meanwhile, Trump administration officials have criticised Canada's decision. The former Biden administration also increased tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024, essentially blocking such exports to the US.","Canada is lifting 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, allowing 49,000 imports annually.

US approval for Nvidia chips and China’s rejection





Nvidia’s return to the Chinese market has hit a major roadblock due to its latest problems with sales of high-end H200 AI chips in the country. Days after Chinese customs officials moved to block the newly-approved processors from entering the mainland, suppliers of key components for the AI chip have reportedly halted production lines.Citing two people with knowledge of the matter, a report by The Financial Times said that the halt marks a sudden reversal just days after the US government officially cleared the way for the shipments. It has been reported that manufacturers of essential parts, including printed circuit boards (PCBs), that are required to package H200 chips have paused operations to avoid mounting inventory losses on hardware.While the Trump administration recently issued a 25% tariff-based approval for the H200, the General Administration of Customs in China reportedly executed its own counter-strategy. Last week, reports said that customs officers were told that Nvidia H200 are not allowed in the country.“The wording from the officials is so severe that it is basically a ban for now,” news agency Reuters reported last week. The move reportedly caught Nvidia off-guard, particularly when the American chipmaker has pushed hard to sell its AI chips in China and the first batches of H200 chips had already arrived in Hong Kong this week.Meanwhile, multiple other reports said that while tech giants like Alibaba, ByteDance and Tencent are eager to secure the H200 for its superior performance, the Chinese government pressured them to prioritise domestic alternatives, such as Huawei’s Ascend chips, and not use them for purposes that may be a threat to the national security.According to a FT report, despite having placed orders for over 2 million H200 units, some Chinese customers are reportedly cancelling their orders due to the uncertainty.","Chinese customs officials moved to block the newly-approved processors from entering the mainland.

Crowding out the rest of the entire ecosystem, even less so.





Palmer Luckey, the Oculus founder whom Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg fired after acquiring his company for $2 billion, has now shared his opinion on the latest round of layoffs at Meta. Luckey expressed sympathy for those affected and has also argued that the job cuts could ultimately strengthen the virtual reality industry. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Luckey pushed back against the narrative that Meta is abandoning VR after cutting 1,500 jobs at Reality Labs which is about 10% of the division’s workforce.“This is not a disaster. They still employ the largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude. Nobody else is even close,” Luckey wrote. He also noted that the layoffs were equivalent to six months of normal churn compressed into two months and insisted Meta remains the dominant force in VR development. He further highlighted that most of the positions eliminated were tied to first-party content development and Meta’s own internally produced games that competed directly with third-party studios.Luckey is of the opinion that subsidising in-house titles with heavy budgets, marketing, and placement distorted the ecosystem and made it harder for independent developers to thrive.I have an opinion on the Meta layoffs that is contrary with most of the VR industry and much of the media, but strongly held.This is not a disaster.They still employ the largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude.Nobody else is even close.The ""Meta is abandoning VR"" narrative is obviously false, 10% layoffs is basically six months of normal churn concentrated into 60 days, strictly numbers wise.The majority of the 1,500 jobs cut in Reality Labs (out of 15,000) were roles working on first-party content, internally developed games that competed directly with third party developers.I think this is a good decision, and I thought the same back when I was still at Oculus.Change always sucks because people lose their jobs in the process, but in a world of limited resources, Meta heavily subsidizing their own (with money, marketing, placement, etc) at the expense of core technical progress and platform stability doesn't make sense.Every developer big and small, even the hyper-efficient ones, have had an extremely hard time competing with games developed by Meta-owned teams with budgets and teams that spend vastly in excess of earning potential.People will point out that these teams did an awesome job and got awesome reviews from critics and customers alike - yes, and fucked up though it is, that makes the problem even worse!Some people will say ""they should have just funded those developers as external studios rather than acquiring them, then!"".Yes, I agree, but hindsight is 20/20.Do you think Oculus expected to only sell 700 copies of Rock Band VR after spending eight figures to make sure it was ready and awesome for Rift CV1 launch, to the point of bundling the guitar adapter with every single headset?Of course not, but sometimes you learn what the world actually wants from you the hard way.TL;DR, I feel really bad for the people impacted, but this is a good thing for the long-term health of the industry, especially the ongoing incentives.",Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has shared his opinion on the latest round of layoffs at Meta.

The emerging opportunity around neoscalers



India's opportunity



By: Gautam Billa, CTO, Asia Pacific, Ciena





India is witnessing a significant shift in how networks are built, scaled and operated. For years, the telecom conversation has been centered on wireless rollout milestones. According to the Department of Telecommunications, 5G is now live across 773 of India's 776 districts, with more than 250,000 sites deployed within twelve months of launch, making it one of the fastest national rollouts anywhere in the world.Today, even as 5G network buildouts continue, the strategic focus is evolving toward a different infrastructure priority: building networks for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud workloads.AI requires different network architectures. While 5G networks are optimized for wide-area wireless connectivity to millions of endpoints, AI demands ultra-high bandwidth interconnects between data centers, low-latency pathways to edge compute nodes, and optical transport systems designed for massive data flows. These are distinct infrastructure requirements and recognizing this early opens meaningful opportunities for service providers.India is emerging as one of the most dynamic markets for AI and cloud infrastructure globally. According to industry estimates, the country's data center capacity is projected to grow at over 50% CAGR. This growth trajectory positions India among the fastest-growing data center markets in the world.The scale of commitment from global technology leaders underscores this momentum. Google announced a 15 billion dollar AI infrastructure hub in Visakhapatnam in partnership with Adani. Microsoft, committed 17.5 billion dollars in India, its largest investment in Asia, including a new hyperscale data center region in Hyderabad and expansion of existing facilities in Chennai and Pune. Reliance Jio is developing an integrated green AI data center in Jamnagar with Meta and Google. AWS has committed 13 billion dollars to expand India cloud capacity by 2030. Multiple clusters are taking shape across Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune and Noida, each driving demand for high-capacity interconnect.A recent industry survey reinforces the impact of AI on network infrastructure. 77 percent of data center experts in India anticipate at least a sixfold increase in data center interconnect bandwidth over the next five years, driven by AI workloads. 52 percent say upcoming builds will be designed exclusively for AI processing.The growth of AI positions data center interconnect and optical backbone architectures at the heart of India's digital economy, requiring operators to think beyond traditional network planning.An important trend is the rise of neoscalers: specialized AI compute providers, GPU-as-a-Service platforms and edge cloud operators positioned between hyperscalers and enterprises. Unlike hyperscalers who often build their own infrastructure, neoscalers typically rely on service providers for connectivity. This creates a significant wholesale bandwidth opportunity for service providers, including high-capacity wavelength services and dedicated optical connectivity between distributed compute locations. Service providers who can deliver these capabilities with the right service levels and operational agility are well positioned to benefit.Recognizing the need for AI-ready networks, 64 percent of Indian data center experts indicated plans to build dedicated fiber networks specifically to support AI workloads according to the same survey. Maintaining fiber rollout momentum is key, and policy frameworks under the National Telecom Policy 2025 and ongoing Right of Way streamlining efforts will enable a more conducive environment for improved connectivity.As optical networks evolve toward higher capacities and automation, and as policy frameworks continue to mature, India is well positioned to build one of the most advanced network fabrics in the world. With a smart network foundation in place, and collaboration across the wider ecosystem, India will attain its broader digital ambitions: from digital public infrastructure to financial inclusion, from smart manufacturing to health tech, from generative AI to regional cloud ecosystems.",India is emerging as one of the most dynamic markets for AI and cloud infrastructure globally.

Deepmind CEO reveals the missing ingredient that LLMs can't fake

Why Demis Hassabis' attack on OpenAI lands differently right now





Demis Hassabis just told the AI world that ChatGPT's path to superintelligence might be a dead end. The Google DeepMind CEO, in an CNBC ""The Tech Download"" podcast, argues that large language models—the technology behind OpenAI 's flagship products—can't achieve true scientific breakthroughs because they're missing what he calls ""a world model.""It's a direct shot at Sam Altman 's scaling strategy. While OpenAI has bet billions on making LLMs bigger and faster, Hassabis says that approach hits a fundamental wall. ""Today's large language models are phenomenal at pattern recognition,"" he explained on ""The Tech Download."" ""But they don't truly understand causality. They don't really know why A leads to B. They just predict the next token based on statistical correlations.""Real scientific invention, Hassabis argues, requires something deeper: the ability to run thought experiments, simulate physics accurately, and reason from first principles. That needs a world model—an internal simulation engine that understands how reality actually works, not just how words typically follow each other.DeepMind is already building this. Their Genie 3 system, released last August, generates interactive 3D environments from text.SIMA 2 trains AI agents inside those simulated worlds. Early research shows these hybrid approaches outperform pure LLMs by 20-30% on reasoning tasks. More importantly, they don't hallucinate basic physics the way ChatGPT sometimes does.The timing makes this more than academic debate. Google's Gemini 3.0 launch in November triggered what Altman called ""Code Red"" inside OpenAI—an emergency refocus after ChatGPT started losing ground. Hassabis essentially confirmed in January that Google forced that panic.Meanwhile, Meta's Llama 4 flopped spectacularly in April, accused of gaming benchmarks. OpenAI hasn't shipped a major model breakthrough since GPT-4. The industry narrative is shifting from ""scale solves everything"" to ""maybe we need different architecture entirely.""Hassabis estimates AGI is still 5-10 years out and requires what he calls ""two AlphaGo-scale breakthroughs."" One of them, he's making clear, isn't just bigger language models. It's teaching AI how the world actually works—something OpenAI's current playbook doesn't address.Whether world models deliver on that promise remains unproven. But Hassabis just made his bet public, and he's positioning Google as the company that saw the limitation first.","Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says large language models like ChatGPT are hitting a wall in achieving true scientific breakthroughs.

America's Cloud Act is spooking European Union leaders. The Cloud Act is a law that gives the US government authority to obtain digital data held by US-based tech corporations irrespective of whether that data is stored on servers at home or on foreign soil.

This has made America companies offering Cloud solutions to change track and offer 'sovereign Cloud' in Europe. Amazon's American rivals including Google and Microsoft also offer customers the option of storing data in Europe.Amazon's cloud computing division recently said that it would expand its ""sovereign cloud"" across the European Union, hoping to cash in as EU governments seek to safeguard their citizens' data. In a statement, the company announced that Amazon Web Services (AWS) would expand its physical ""footprint"" into Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal; adding to a site in eastern Germany. ""The expansion would ""provide organisations with further options to deploy workloads in the cloud with the highest level of sovereignty and operational independence"", AWS said.""By building a cloud that is European in its infrastructure, operations, and governance, we're empowering organisations to innovate with confidence while maintaining complete control over their digital assets,"" said Stephane Israel, AWS's head of European Sovereign Cloud.Spooked by a lack of European tech champions to compete with US giants, EU leaders have been pushing for ""digital sovereignty"" in recent years and called for reducing the continent's reliance on American technology. The worries have only grown as US President Donald Trump's administration has taken a more confrontation tone with EU leaders. Last month, US cancelled visa of seven prominent European leaders.Recently a report in The Register said that Europe's biggest aerospace company Airbus reportedly wants to move away from two of the biggest American technology companies -- Google and Microsoft. According to the report, Airbus is preparing to tender a major contract to migrate mission-critical workloads to a digitally sovereign European cloud.While American technology giants have been investing in 'sovereign Cloud' to quell fears od European companies, these soloutions are really not much of help as per European analysts. Harald Wehnes, a professor of computer science at the University of Wuerzburg, told AFP he thought AWS's announcement was an example of ""sovereignty washing"". ""The American CLOUD Act means Europeans' sensitive data can end up with the US administration as soon as it is with American cloud companies, even if it is stored on European servers,"" he said. ""If I have a European cloud provider, like IONOS, Hetzner or Noris Network, that doesn't apply.""","Amazon's cloud computing division recently said that it would expand its ""sovereign cloud"" across the European Union.

ChatGPT performs better when you're rude to it but researchers warn that there’s a catch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-performs-better-when-youre-rude-to-it-but-researchers-warn-that-theres-a-catch/articleshow/126640618.cms,"A recent study suggests AI chatbots like ChatGPT perform better with rude prompts, achieving higher accuracy. Researchers found demanding language yielded superior results compared to polite requests. However, they caution this could foster harmful communication habits, potentially impacting human interactions. The findings highlight AI's unexpected sensitivity to tone, adding complexity to human-AI engagement.

Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse

“Using insulting or demeaning language in

human-AI interaction

could have negative effects on user experience, accessibility, and inclusivity, and may contribute to harmful communication norms,”

AI chatbots are more sensitive to tone than researchers expected: Study

“For the longest of times, we humans have wanted conversational interfaces for interacting with machines. But now we realise that there are drawbacks for such interfaces too, and there is some value in APIs that are structured.”





AI chatbots like ChatGPT respond more accurately when users are rude to them, a new study claims. However, researchers warn that the approach could create harmful communication habits. According to a report by Fortune, researchers at the Pennsylvania State University tested ChatGPT's 4o model on 50 multiple-choice questions, using over 250 prompts ranging from very polite to very rude. They found that “very rude” prompts achieved 84.8% accuracy, which was four percentage points higher than ""very polite"" prompts.The AI was more responsive to bossy language such as ""Hey, gofer, figure this out"" than to polite language such as ""Would you be so kind as to solve the following question?"" At the same time, researchers warned that using rude language with AI could have negative consequences in the long run.the researchers wrote.The study suggests that while a demanding tone might improve ChatGPT's performance in the short term, it could encourage uncivil behaviour that spills over into how people interact with each other.The early-stage study, which other scientists have not yet reviewed, provides new proof that both how sentences are built and the tone used can affect how AI chatbots respond. It may also show that interactions between humans and AI are more complex than experts previously believed.Earlier studies on AI chatbot behaviour have found that chatbots are sensitive to the information humans provide. In one study, University of Pennsylvania researchers tricked AI language models into giving banned responses by using persuasion tricks that work on people.In another study, scientists discovered that AI language models were at risk of ""brain rot,"" a type of lasting mental decline. The models showed higher levels of dangerous personality traits when continuously fed low-quality viral content.The Penn State researchers pointed out some weaknesses in their study, such as the relatively small number of responses tested and the fact that they mostly used just one AI model, ChatGPT 4o.The researchers also said more advanced AI models might ""disregard issues of tone and focus on the essence of each question."" Still, the research adds to the growing curiosity about AI models and their complexity.This is especially important because the study found ChatGPT's answers change based on slight differences in prompts, even when given a supposedly simple format like a multiple-choice test, said one of the researchers, Penn State Information Systems professor Akhil Kumar, who has degrees in both electrical engineering and computer science.In an email to Fortune, Kumar said,","Researchers at the Pennsylvania State University tested ChatGPT's 4o model on 50 multiple-choice questions, using over 250 prompts ranging from very polite to very rude.

Quote of the day by Apple CEO Tim Cook: “I love museums. But I don’t want to …”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-apple-ceo-tim-cook-i-love-museums-but-i-dont-want-to-/articleshow/126658877.cms,"Tim Cook (Image source: Reuters)

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”



“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation



A lesson in leadership and decision-making



Why the quote resonates beyond technology



A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style



Why the quote still matters



""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a more general sense, the quote talks about how societies deal with progress. Tradition and new ideas often clash with each other. It's important to respect culture and history, but it's also important to be open to new things. Cook's statement does not deny the past. It just won't let itself be limited by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126659211,imgsize-22842,width-400,resizemode-4/tim-cook-image-source-reuters.jpg"

"US chip tariff: South Korea says limited immediate impact, warns of ‘phase 2’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-chip-tariff-south-korea-says-limited-immediate-impact-warns-of-phase-2/articleshow/126656226.cms,"US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warns of ‘100% tariff’







South Korea’s trade ministry has responded to the Trump administration’s new trade policy wherein the company has imposed 25% tariff on advanced computing chips. The country’s trade minister has said that the tariffs will have a “limited impact” on the country's tech giants – for now. According to news agency Reuters, South Korea’s Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo noted that since the current measures focus on logic chips rather than the memory chips that dominate South Korea’s exports, the immediate financial blow is cushioned.“Since the memory chips that South Korean companies mainly export are currently excluded, the immediate impact is expected to be limited,” Minister Yeo said. On January 14, President Donald Trump signed the order that specifically targets high-end AI processors like Nvidia’s H200 and AMD’s MI325X.The White House, nevertheless, has also exempted for US data centers, startups and civil industrial applications to prevent a total shock to the American AI sector. However, Yeo warned that “it is not yet time to be reassured,” citing the looming threat of a “Phase 2” expansion that could eventually pull more general-purpose semiconductors into the tariff net.Meanwhile, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick issued a stark ultimatum to foreign manufacturers, that in sharp contrast with South Korea’s optimism.Speaking at a Micron plant groundbreaking in New York, Lutnick said that South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers who fail to invest in American-based production could face tariffs as high as 100%.The strategy is reportedly a part of a broader Section 232 investigation aimed at incentivising domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on the East Asian supply chain. While Samsung and SK Hynix have already committed billions to US facilities, the threat of 100% duties serves as a high-pressure tactic to ensure those commitments are accelerated.The report added that the South Korean government confirmed it is working “closely with industry” to navigate these shifting benchmarks that are designed to penalise companies that keep their most advanced production lines on foreign soil.","South Korea’s trade minister Yeo Han-koo has said that the tariffs will have a “limited impact” on the country's tech giants – for now.

Jason Calacanis names three better options than ChatGPT



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also moved to using Gemini 3







ChatGPT appears to be losing its ‘charm’ as prominent Silicon Valley figures are moving to adopt other AI solutions offered by companies like Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI. One of the biggest American angel investors and entrepreneur, Jason Calacanis, has announced that he has officially cancelled his firm’s $10,000-a-year corporate subscription to OpenAI ’s AI offering.Calacanis cited both performance stagnation and a lack of trust in how the company handles corporate data as the reasons for cancelling the subscription.“Cancelled our corporate OpenAI account today; We were spending ~ $10k a year,” Calacanis said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“ChatGPT isn’t keeping up imo — and I don’t trust them with my corporate data. Long game, but I think ChatGPT is 4th place now,” added Calacanis, who is also an early-stage investor and co-host of the All-In podcast.While calling ChatGPT the forth option, Calacanis says there three AI chatbot models that are better than OpeAI’s offering. He praised xAI for its “real-time data”, Google Gemini for its travel, local information and YouTube integration; and Anthropic’s Claude for its prowess in handling corporate workflows.“xAI is better for real time data, Gemini is better for travel, local YouTube and Claude AI is much better for corporate (Cowork and Project features specifically),” he added.The move comes at a time of peak volatility in the AI sector, as Google’s newly released Gemini 3 has begin to erode OpenAI’s once-impenetrable market share, and Calacanis is not alone in his defection. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a long-time daily user of ChatGPT, also announced a permanent move to Google’s Gemini 3 after a two-hour trial run.Soon after the launch of Gemini 3 last year, Benioff posted on X, “Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back.”He described the leap in reasoning, speed, and multimodal capabilities as “insane”.“The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video... everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again.,” he added.","Angel investor Jason Calacanis has officially cancelled his firm’s $10,000-a-year corporate subscription to OpenAI ’s AI offering.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said that the United States will not survive without secure elections. The tech billionaire was responding to a post by Republican Senator Rick Scott that promoted new legislation aimed at tightening voting rules. “If we've learned anything over the last few years, it's that securing our elections is crucial. I’m leading the SAVE Act with my good friend, @BasedMikeLee, to make sure only U.S. citizens get to vote in our elections. This is common sense,” Scott wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.Elon Musk quoted the post, writing “America will die without secure elections”.The SAVE Act, short for Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, aims to require proof of US citizenship for voter registration in federal elections. Supporters of the bill argue that it is necessary to prevent illegal voting and protect the integrity of elections in the US. Critics, however, have said similar measures could make it harder for some eligible voters to cast their ballots.Musk has increasingly commented on US political issues in recent years, often using X to engage with lawmakers and public figures. His views on elections, free speech, and government policy have frequently sparked debate online.The US election system has remained a contentious issue since the 2020 presidential election, with lawmakers divided over how to balance voter access and election security. Several states have passed or proposed laws related to voter identification, mail-in ballots, and voter registration.The SAVE Act is currently being discussed in Congress and would need approval from both chambers before becoming law.","The SAVE Act, short for Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, aims to require proof of US citizenship for voter registration in federal elections.

White House's plan to tackle Tariff pain

The US President Donald Trump is betting big on artificial intelligence (AI) and the data centers driving its development. Just hours after his Inauguration in January, one of his first major announcements was an investment of as much as $500 billion in AI infrastructure by SoftBank Group, OpenAI and Oracle Corp. The AI data center industry too is thriving in America, fueled by a fierce competition among tech giants like Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, and others vying for AI supremacy -- both against each other and global rivals like China.According to a report in Bloomberg, the surge has become a significant engine of US economic growth, contributing as much as 0.3% to GDP last year, roughly $100 billion, as per JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts. With companies like Google and Meta Platforms Inc. unveiling projects worth hundreds of billions in recent months, Bloomberg Intelligence predicts investment could soar 64% this year and climb another 14% in 2026, peaking at $135 billion by 2027.But some analysts are seeing a problem in President Donald Trump's 'AI ambitions', and it is called Trump Tariffs. They reportedly fear that the President Trump's aggressive tariff policies could saddle US businesses with steep new costs as they invest hundreds of billions into this booming sector. As constructing these facilities is only half the battle. Equipping them with cutting-edge hardware -- much of which is imported -- exposes the industry to the ripple effects of Trump’s trade policies.As the Bloomberg report points out, Trump has already slapped a 20% duty on imports from China and wavered on a 25% tariff for Mexico, the two largest suppliers of U.S. computer equipment. Steel, aluminum, and other critical materials have also been hit, with more tariffs looming for Asian nations and key components like semiconductors. Niccolo Lombatti, a digital infrastructure analyst at BMI told Bloomberg that “a broader application of tariffs globally could pose a significant downside risk to the U.S. data center market, given its reliance on a global supply chain.”These added costs might not faze tech titans chasing AI breakthroughs -- viewed as the most transformative technological leap of our time. But after China’s DeepSeek model shook markets with a cheaper alternative, tariffs represent yet another challenge, potentially inflating project budgets or delaying timelines if supply chains falter.The White House counters that slashing energy costs through deregulation and boosted production will cushion these blows, a critical factor given power’s outsized role in data center expenses. Still, the broader reliance on foreign machinery complicates Trump’s goal of reviving domestic manufacturing while shrinking the trade deficit.Tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta—flush with cash—recently boosted capital spending projections by 32% from last year, shrugging off DeepSeek’s disruption. But then as trade war tensions ripple through the economy, it is tough for any industry to be immune. “Tariffs are taxes on imports, and taxing imports increases prices,” told Patrick Lozada of the Telecommunications Industry Association to the publication. “That’s going to be true in data centers, just the same as it is for consumer products,” he added.","US President Donald Trump is betting big on artificial intelligence (AI) and the data centers driving its development.

"Apple slams EU order to open up, warns it’s bad for iPhones and iPads users in Europe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-slams-eu-order-to-open-up-warns-its-bad-for-iphones-and-ipads-users-in-europe/articleshow/119218580.cms,"What Apple said on EU order

What EU wants from Apple

US President Donald Trump may see this as 'provocation'

The European Union has taken a significant step in enforcing its Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting tech giant Apple with a detailed set of requirements aimed at opening up the iPhone's ecosystem to third-party connected devices. The announcement, made today, builds on last fall's specification procedures and outlines specific integrations the EU Commission expects Apple to implement, including access to iOS notifications, AirDrop-like file sharing, and AirPlay streaming for competitors.Teresa Ribera, the EU's antitrust chief, emphasized the bloc's commitment to compliance with the DMA. ""Let me be clear: Our main focus is creating a culture of compliance,"" she said in a statement. Ribera hailed the measure against Apple as an ""important step"" toward dismantling the company's tightly controlled ecosystem.Apple, however, sharply criticized the EU's decision. ""Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape,"" the company said in a statement. ""It’s bad for our products and for our European users."" The tech giant argues that the mandated changes will complicate its operations and compromise the user experience.The EU's demands are extensive. Third-party smartwatches must gain full access to iOS notifications and background execution privileges, mirroring the functionality of the Apple Watch. Headphone manufacturers will be granted access to features like proximity auto-pairing and automatic audio switching, currently exclusive to AirPods. Beyond these examples, the EU insists that all Apple features tied to first-party hardware integrations—present and future—must be made available to third-party companies at no cost, with relevant frameworks and APIs released concurrently with Apple's own platform updates.The decision has broader implications, signaling the EU's intent to ensure seamless interoperability across all types of connected devices. However, it could also stoke tensions across the Atlantic. U.S. President Donald Trump, a vocal critic of the EU's antitrust actions, may view this move -- and any future penalties -- as a provocation. Trump has previously likened the bloc's fines to tariffs against the U.S., and with his administration already engaged in a trade dispute over steel and aluminum tariffs, further EU actions could escalate into a tit-for-tat confrontation.As the DMA continues to reshape the tech landscape, today's ruling marks a pivotal moment in the EU's push to level the playing field, setting the stage for a potential showdown between Brussels and Silicon Valley -- and possibly Washington.","EU demands Apple open up iPhone's ecosystem to third-party connected devices.

Netflix has accused Hollywood director Carl Erik Rinsch of swindling out $11 million. Rinsch was arrested after the streaming giant pressed charges against him for swindling money for a sci-fi show that never aired. According to the charges filed by the company, instead of producing the show, Rinsch allegedly steered the cash toward cryptocurrency investments and lavish purchases which included a fleet of Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari. Rinsch, known for directing the film “47 Ronin,” has also been charged with wire fraud and money laundering over the scheme to defraud the streaming giant, federal prosecutors alleged. He was arrested in West Hollywood, California, and has reportedly had an initial court hearing.A report by the news agency AP cited the prosecutors who claimed that Netflix initially paid around $44 million to acquire the unfinished show White Horse from Rinsch. The company later provided an additional $11 million after he claimed more funds were needed to complete production, the prosecutors highlighted.Instead of using the extra money for the show, Rinsch allegedly transferred it to a personal brokerage account, where he made unsuccessful investments that lost nearly half of the amount within two months, the company alleged.He then moved the remaining funds into cryptocurrency, which proved profitable, eventually transferring the earnings into his personal bank account, the prosecutors further added.As per the indictment, Rinsch went on a $10 million spending spree, using the money for personal expenses and luxury purchases. This included nearly $1.8 million on credit card bills, $1 million on legal fees to sue Netflix for more money, $3.8 million on furniture and antiques, $2.4 million on five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari, and $652,000 on watches and clothing.","Hollywood director Carl Erik Rinsch has been charged with swindling $11 million from Netflix.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Instead, she asserts that Indian consumers are discerning buyers, driven by a keen appreciation for technological value and specific, impactful experiences.Dasgupta's insights, revealed in a recent interview, shed light on the strategic approach HP is taking to cater to the unique demands of this dynamic market.“The Indian market is very price sensitive, sure, but the Indian market is also a very keen buyer of technology because the value of it is perceived,” she told The Times of India at the HP Amplify 2025 conference.“So I think the important thing with India is not that it's a price sensitive market; it is a value sensitive market, and there are a few things that Indians pay for,” she added, explaining that consumers are willing to pay for things that provide value, such as education, work opportunities and experiences.Dasgupta said that Indians are quick to adopt and utilise technology that adds value to their lives.“I don’t think there’s a country that adopts technology as quickly and as successfully as Indians do, and the phones have proved that. The one thing that is very clear is that if a technology creates value, Indians are not shy about using it,” she noted.For Dasgupta, instead of focusing on adapting technology to trends or changing demographics, the key to success in India lies in understanding the Indian household and individual's way of life and ensuring that technology caters to their specific needs and provides significant value.She said that HP India aims to make PCs relevant and accessible to larger groups, including using PCs for education, income generation for women and digitizing SMEs/MSMEs.“We need to make sure that we deliver those [devices, tools and services],” she said, noting that HP is focused on increasing the number of first-time PC buyers in India.IDC reports that India's PC market experienced a 3.8% year-over-year growth in 2024. HP held the largest market share at 30.1%, leading in both consumer and commercial segments. HP saw 14.7% and 14.3% growth in its government and enterprise segments, respectively; however, its consumer segment declined by 7.5% year-over-year due to heightened competition, particularly within the eTailer channel.HP has over 750 HP World stores making India the only market in the world the company has such a big retail presence.When asked about the company’s AI strategy for India, Dasgupta said, “India will largely be servicing an aging population and will be a large part of the global workforce. From that perspective, [we] ensure that [the company] enables this workforce to deliver value as well as get value out of devices.”She added that “HP AI PCs can help enhance growth both from a skilling perspective as well as from enhancing work perspective for a workforce in India. That's going to be very important for the whole world and for India as well.”When asked whether there’s enough good feedback from Indian consumers for HP to look into developing AI products and services tailored specifically for India, Dasgupta said that programmes with the central and several state governments provide proof of concept for AI-powered PCs to enhance skilling and work opportunities, particularly for India's young workforce.“We think of it as proof of concept. So, we have been working with the governments of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as well as the central government on various skilling programmes for youth. And skilling that makes them employable right after these skilling programmes,” she noted.","HP India’s managing director and senior vice president, Ipsita Dasgupta, has challenged the conventional notion of the market as solely price-sensitive.

"'Words Matter, so ...', says Urban Company as it renames Insta Maids",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/words-matter-so-says-urban-company-as-it-renames-insta-maids/articleshow/119215018.cms,"Urban Company has rebranded its quick-service offering Insta Maids to Insta Help following social media criticism. The rebranding aims to emphasize dignity and respect for domestic workers. Insta Help will continue providing reliable househelp services and benefits to service partners. Urban Company believes that words matter and appreciates public feedback for driving the change.

What is Insta Help



Here’s what Urban Company said

Insta Maids is now Insta Help

When we build something new, we're not just launching a service - we're shaping the way people live. At Urban Company, we've been fortunate to redefine home services, but with that comes the responsibility to listen, reflect, and grow.

We recently launched Insta Maids with the vision of creating a trustworthy and convenient househelp service that India can rely on. Just as importantly, we aimed to empower our service partners with stable work opportunities, respectable earnings of T150-180 per hour (T20,000-25,000 per month), and benefits like free health insurance and on-job life and accidental coverage. We saw this as a step toward formalizing and uplifting a traditionally unorganized sector.

When we first heard concerns on social media about the word ""maids,"" we paused to reflect. Our instinctive reaction was - ""What's in a name? Our actions will carry more weight than words"". As a team driven by logic and data, we focused on the tangible aspects - fair pay, insurance, and formalization, without fully appreciating the cultural and emotional layers at play. From a marketing perspective, ""Insta Maids"" was perfect - it resonated instantly with our target audience and was gaining traction fast. Lakhs of people searched for ""Insta Maids"" on our app just over the weekend! This made the decision even harder.

But as we listened more deeply, we began to see what we had overlooked. We realized that progress isn't just about convenience and formalization, it is also about the values we choose to uphold and reinforce.

Words matter. They carry history, cultural context, influence perception, and shape dignity. As a company striving to create meaningful change, we recognize that getting this right is essential. That's why we're making a change - Insta Maids is now Insta Help. This isn't just about renaming a service; it's about reaffirming our commitment to a future where every service professional is valued, respected and accorded the dignity of labour they deserve.

To everyone who challenged us to think deeper - thank you. Growth comes from listening, and this is how we move forward, together.

Urban Company has rebranded its newly launched quick-service offering from Insta Maids to Insta Help following criticism over the original name. The change comes after social media users raised concerns about the term maids and its implications regarding dignity and respect for domestic workers. Announcing the update on X, Urban Company wrote:""Words matter. That’s why Insta Maids is now Insta Help—because dignity, respect, and progress start with the name, and go beyond. Thank you for your feedback and for helping us make this change.""The service, initially launched as Insta Maids, is designed to provide quick, reliable househelp services while also offering stable work opportunities for service partners, including earnings of ₹150-180 per hour (₹20,000-25,000 per month) along with benefits like free health insurance and accident coverage.Urban Company admitted that at first, they focused on the practical benefits of the service—fair pay, job security, and formalization of an unorganized sector—rather than the cultural and emotional impact of the name.""Our instinctive reaction was—'What's in a name? Our actions will carry more weight than words,'"" the company stated. However, after reflecting on public feedback, they acknowledged that words shape dignity, perception, and social values.The renaming of Insta Maids to Insta Help is more than a branding change—it’s a reaffirmation of Urban Company’s commitment to uplifting service professionals.""Progress isn’t just about convenience and formalization; it’s also about the values we choose to uphold and reinforce,"" the company said.Urban Company concluded by thanking users for challenging them to think deeper and emphasized that growth comes from listening, reflecting, and evolving together.",Urban Company has rebranded its newly launched quick-service offering from Insta Maids to Insta Help following criticism over the original name.

"Government makes a 'BIS' exception for AC and refrigerator components, and why this is 'good news' for buyers this summer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-makes-a-bis-exception-for-ac-and-refrigerator-components-and-why-this-is-good-news-for-buyers-this-summer/articleshow/119205212.cms,"Why 'BIS' exemption is good news for AC buyers

BIS exemption averts potential disruption for AC manufacturers

The government has reportedly exempted certain critical air-conditioner and refrigerator components from mandatory Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification. According to a report in Economic Times, the exemption from BIS certification is aimed to prevent an acute shortage as India braces for a harsh summer. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has reportedly lifted the BIS certification of factory requirement for Grooved Copper Tubes and AC compressors of 2 tonnes and above capacity. The exemption also includes those imported from China, as asked by the industry.""We expect a BIS waiver for refrigerator compressors and those used in ACs with below two-tonne capacity,"" an industry executive told ET. ""The AC compressor BIS waiver is immediately required since local capacities are still just 40-45% of the demand, while the situation is better for refrigerator compressors as some companies like LG, Godrej and Samsung manufactures them locally.""The exemption is good news for AC buyers as the shortage of key components would have hampered production of ACs and refrigerators in turn raising their prices. For buyers, the exemptions promise continued availability and affordability of cooling appliances as demand peaks.As the report says, the government decision comes after AC and refrigerator manufacturers in the country had flagged possibilities of acute shortage of products this summer due to non-BIS certification of their copper and compressor vendors in China and nearby countries.The exemptions address a critical gap in local manufacturing capacity, which meets only 40-45% of AC compressor demand and struggles to keep pace with rising needs amid an early summer onset. A leading AC brand’s CEO, speaking anonymously, noted that domestic copper tube prices far exceed those from Chinese vendors, making the BIS waiver a “breather” for the industry.DPIIT also permitted imports of copper tubes up to 25% of last year’s total value between January and March. While smaller AC compressors (below 2 tonnes) and refrigerator compressors await similar relief, three senior industry executives anticipate an imminent government notification expanding the exemptions.The move follows pleas from manufacturers, including Amber Enterprises, which flagged potential production disruptions in April due to component shortages. Industry bodies have reportedly long pushed for BIS waivers until domestic capacity improves, especially as BIS approvals for key Chinese suppliers like Wanbao Group and Highly Group’s plants lapse in 2024, reducing certified vendors from eight to two. Without renewals, supply chains could tighten further.","The exemption from BIS certification is aimed to prevent an acute shortage as India braces for a harsh summer.

Elon Musk and Donald Trump previously raised concerns



SSA clarifies database entries do not indicate active payments

Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has removed 3.2 million names from the Social Security database. All of them were listed as 120 years or older and have now been marked as deceased. DOGE confirmed the update on X, stating that it has been conducting a records cleanup for the past two weeks. “Approximately 3.2 million numberholders, all listed age 120+, have now been marked as deceased. More work still to be done,” the post reads.Musk shared the post, commenting, ""Cleaning up the dead people database.""In February, Musk had raised concerns about Social Security records , claiming that millions of deceased individuals were still listed as alive. He suggested this could lead to errors in benefit distribution. US President Donald Trump had also made similar claims, stating that millions of people over 100 years old remained in the database, with some still receiving payments.The Social Security Administration (SSA) later clarified that these records do not necessarily indicate active benefit payments. The agency emphasized the need for accurate record-keeping, even for individuals not receiving benefits.A July 2024 report from Social Security’s inspector general found that from 2015 to 2022, the agency issued $71.8 billion in improper payments, representing less than 1% of total benefits paid. Most errors were overpayments to living individuals.Some issues arise from Social Security’s software, which defaults missing or incomplete birthdates to over 150 years ago. Reports from 2023 and 2024 also found that the SSA has yet to fully update its system for accurately tracking deaths. The database includes about 18.9 million records of people born in 1920 or earlier who are not marked as deceased, though this does not necessarily mean they are receiving benefits.","Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has removed 3.2 million names from the Social Security database.

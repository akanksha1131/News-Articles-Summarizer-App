What the lawsuit against Google and Character.AI's app claims

Alphabet's Google and artificial-intelligence startup Character.AI must face a lawsuit from a Florida woman named Megan Garcia. Garcia believes that Character.AI is responsible for the death of her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, who died by suicide in February this year. Setzer was messaging with the bot in the moments before he died, she alleged in her lawsuit. Garcia claims Character.AI's chatbots contributed to her son's suicide, a U.S. judge has ruled. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the US District Judge Anne Conway stated that the companies had not demonstrated at this early stage of the legal proceedings that the U.S. Constitution's free-speech protections shielded them from Megan Garcia's lawsuit. The lawsuit, considered one of the first in the U.S. against an AI firm for alleged failure to protect children from psychological harm, claims that the teenager died by suicide after developing an obsession with an AI-powered chatbot.A spokesperson for Character.AI reportedly that the company would continue to contest the lawsuit and employs safety measures on its platform to safeguard minors, including features designed to prevent ""conversations about self-harm.""Character.AI and Google had requested the court to dismiss the lawsuit on several grounds, including the argument that the chatbots' output constituted constitutionally protected free speech. Judge Conway rejected this argument, stating that Character.AI and Google ""fail to articulate why words strung together by an LLM (large language model) are speech."" The judge also denied Google's request to be found not liable for allegedly aiding Character.AI's misconduct. Meetali Jain, Garcia's attorney, is said to have hailed the court's decision as ""historic"" and said it ""sets a new precedent for legal accountability across the AI and tech ecosystem.""Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda expressed the company's strong disagreement with the decision. Castaneda also emphasized that Google and Character.AI are ""entirely separate"" entities and that Google ""did not create, design, or manage Character.AI's app or any component part of it.""For those wondering Google link of Character.AI, the Character.AI company was founded by two former Google engineers who were later rehired by Google as part of an agreement granting the tech giant a license to the startup's technology. Garcia argued that this arrangement made Google a co-creator of the technology.She filed the lawsuit in October following the death of her son in February 2024. The lawsuit alleges that Character.AI programmed its chatbots to present themselves as ""a real person, a licensed psychotherapist, and an adult lover, ultimately resulting in Sewell's desire to no longer live outside"" of its digital world.According to the complaint, Setzer took his own life shortly after telling a Character.AI chatbot impersonating ""Game of Thrones"" character Daenerys Targaryen that he would ""come home right now."" Garcia reportedly brought the lawsuit against Character.AI with the help of Matthew Bergman, the founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center, which has also brought cases on behalf of families who said their children were harmed by Meta, Snapchat, TikTok and Discord.","A U.S. judge has ruled that Google and Character.AI must face a lawsuit from a Florida woman named Megan Garcia.

Consumer Costs vs Promised Savings

How Efficiency Standards Work and Why They Matter

DOE’s Deregulatory Agenda Divides

The Trump administration’s push to dismantle 12 energy efficiency standards may face significant legal hurdles due to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act’s (EPCA) anti-backsliding provision, which prohibits weakening established efficiency rules. Environmental and consumer advocacy groups are expected to challenge the rollbacks in court, arguing that the Department of Energy’s (DOE) actions violate federal law. According to a report in The Verge, the DOE’s proposals, part of what it calls its “largest deregulatory effort in history,” have already sparked controversy, with critics warning of long-term economic and environmental consequences.On May 1, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum instructing the DOE to halt enforcement of several efficiency standards targeted for revision or elimination. This directive aligns with the administration’s broader deregulatory agenda but has drawn criticism for undermining decades of progress in energy conservation. The DOE has not yet responded to inquiries from The Verge regarding the rollback plans or their potential impacts.Adding to the controversy, reports surfaced in May 2025 that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to terminate the Energy Star program. This voluntary certification, which identifies energy-efficient products, reportedly saves the average household in America approximately $450 annually on energy bills. The program’s potential closure, combined with the DOE’s rollbacks, signals a broader retreat from energy efficiency initiatives.The Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) estimates that scrapping these 12 standards could cost households and businesses $43.2 billion in higher electricity bills over the lifetime of affected products. This figure starkly contrasts with the DOE’s claim that deregulation would save $11 billion by eliminating “burdensome and costly” rules. ASAP’s deputy director, Joanna Mauer told The Verge, “The department is looking at the savings these rollbacks would provide while completely ignoring the costs. It turns out that the costs would be nearly five times greater than the savings.”Energy efficiency standards set minimum performance requirements for appliances, ensuring they consume less energy while maintaining functionality. These rules cover a wide range of products, including microwave ovens, cooking tops, air purifiers, dehumidifiers, battery chargers, and portable air conditioners. For example, the 2020 efficiency standard for portable air conditioners was projected to cost consumers $1 billion upfront due to higher purchase prices but save $4.1 billion in energy bills over 30 years, yielding a net savings of $3.1 billion. ASAP’s analysis, reportedly based on DOE’s own data, shows that the 12 targeted standards would collectively deliver $43.2 billion in net savings.In a recent announcement, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright defended the rollbacks, stating, “We are bringing back common sense — slashing regulations meant to appease Green New Deal fantasies, restrict consumer choice and increase costs for the American people.” The DOE argues that eliminating these standards reduces manufacturing costs and provides consumers with more affordable, less efficient options. However, ASAP contends that this approach ignores the long-term financial burden of higher energy consumption, particularly for low-income households that spend a larger share of their income on utility bills.",President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum instructing the DOE to halt enforcement of several efficiency standards.

What and Why of Walmart Boycott

Walmart on Walmart Boycott

Dates of other planned boycotts

The Walmart Boycott is back. The world’s largest retailer faces renewed calls for a nationwide boycott led by The People’s Union USA , the same group behind the weeklong protest in April. The organizers are urging consumers to shun Walmart and its subsidiaries, including Sam’s Club, Walmart Pharmacy, and Walmart+, citing ongoing concerns over the company’s labor practices and community impact. The organisers of the nationwide protests are same.Walmart Boycott starts on May 20 and ends on May 26.The People’s Union USA group encouraged consumers to boycott Walmart because it believes the retailer has contributed to economic corruption. They are protesting against companies that have rolled back their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts after President Donald Trump's efforts to eliminate federal DEI programs since taking office.According to the group’s website, it aims to “expose corruption and exploitation” and “hold corporations accountable” for unethical business practices that have kept Americans “divided, distracted, and struggling for decades.”“We’re using the one tool that always makes them listen, money,” said The People’s Union USA on its website. “Economic resistance is our frontline weapon. And behind that, we’ve got something they’ll never understand: resilience, strength, and the will to endure. They raise prices, we stop spending. They ignore our voices, we cut their profits. They divide, we unite.” “What we can do is hold these companies accountable for not paying their fair share of taxes, for price gouging and for inequality,” said John Schwarz, the group's founder.In a statement to USA TODAY, Walmart spokesperson said, ""As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year,'' it read. "" We remain dedicated to earning the business of all Americans and giving our time and resources to causes that uplift and unite communities who rely on us every day.""The group has been organizing “economic blackouts” of large corporations since February this year. So far, it has organized specific boycotts aimed at Amazon and General Mills. After the current Walmart boycott concludes, Target and McDonald’s are next on its list.* June 3-9: Target* June 24-30: McDonald's* July 4: Independence Day Blackout","Walmart Boycott starts on May 20 and ends on May 26.

What comes next for Meta

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system.

Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, future-proofing one's career is a paramount concern for students. When posed with the hypothetical question of what advice he would offer his younger self to navigate this future, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's answer is clear and surprisingly personal: embrace generative artificial intelligence. Speaking on a recent episode of the ""Huge Conversations"" show with Cleo Abram, Huang emphasized the critical importance of learning how to effectively interact with AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, and Grok. ""The first thing I would do is to learn AI,"" he stated.Drawing a parallel to human interaction, Huang explained that ""learning how to interact with AI is not unlike being someone who’s really good at asking questions."" He elaborated on the nuance involved, saying, ""Prompting AI is very similar. You can’t just randomly ask a bunch of questions. Asking AI to be an assistant to you requires some expertise and artistry of how to prompt it.""To illustrate his point, Huang offered the analogy of an entrepreneur facing a vague question about their business. Just as a specific query elicits a more helpful response from a person, the same holds true for AI. Kelly Daniel, Lazarus AI prompt director, echoed this sentiment in a February CNBC Make It article, suggesting that users should approach chatbots with the mindset of interacting with a child, requiring clear and well-structured prompts.Nvidia CEO's advice to studentsHuang's advice comes at a crucial time, as a 2024 report from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Common Sense Media, and Hopelab revealed that only 11% of Americans aged 14 to 22 currently use generative AI once or twice per week. This is despite LinkedIn's 2025 Work Change report projecting that a significant 70% of job skills could be impacted by AI by the year 2030.The ability to craft effective AI prompts – and by extension, ask better questions in general – is presented by Huang as a fundamental skill that will maintain its relevance across all career paths. He urged students to dedicate time to developing this proficiency, regardless of their chosen field.""If I were a student today, irrespective of whether it’s for math or science or chemistry or biology — doesn’t matter what field of science I’m going into or what profession — I’m going to ask myself, ‘How can I use AI to do my job better?’"" Huang concluded, underscoring the transformative potential of AI as a tool for enhancing productivity and success in any future career.Nvidia CEO to students : Don't be afraid of failuresTalking about failure, Huang said that he has been Nvidia’s CEO for more than three decades, and he’s grown the company — through ups and downs — into a $2.2 trillion behemoth. Addressing graduating students in a May 2023 commencement speech at National Taiwan University, Huang said, “At Nvidia, I [have] experienced failures. Great big ones — all humiliating and embarrassing.”","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says students should learn how to interact with AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, and Grok.

Amazon dropped its tariff transparency plan after Trump’s intervention

Walmart has responded to Donald Trump’s criticism where he suggested that the retailer should “Eat The Tariffs” rather than passing the increased prices onto consumers. Walmart spokesperson Joe Pennington told USA Today that the company has always worked to keep prices as low as possible and will continue doing so as long as it can. “We have always worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we won’t stop,” Pennington said, adding “We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins.”Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently warned that it would begin raising prices later this month due to high tariffs. In an interview with CNBC on May 15, the company’s CFO John David Rainey said: “The level of tariffs that have been proposed is pretty challenging for all retailers, for suppliers, and certainly our concern is that consumers are going to feel some of that”.Responding to the comments, the US President shared a post on May 17 on Truth Social to write:“Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, “EAT THE TARIFFS,” and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”Last month, a somewhat similar incident unfolded between President Donald Trump and Amazon. The company had planned to show customers how much of a product’s price was linked to tariffs imposed during Trump’s earlier term. But before the plan went live, Trump reportedly called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to express his displeasure. Soon after the call, Amazon reversed the decision.Trump later praised Bezos in public, saying, “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific… He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”",Walmart has responded to Donald Trump’s criticism where he suggested that the retailer should “Eat The Tariffs” rather than passing the increased prices onto consumers.

The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million in cash charges in connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, associated with employee severance and related employee costs, as well as additional non-cash charges related to acceleration of certain previously granted stock-based awards as part of severance packages for employees impacted under the 2025 Restructuring Plan,” said the company in a regulatory filling.The layoffs come just days after Austin Russell stepped down as CEO and Chairperson of the Board, following an ethics inquiry by Luminar’s Audit Committee. While the company did not disclose details of the investigation, it stated that Russell’s departure does not impact financial results. Luminar’s board has appointed Paul Ricci, former CEO of Nuance, as Russell’s replacement.In addition to Russell’s exit, board member Jun Hong Heng also resigned, though Luminar clarified that his departure was not due to disagreements over company policies or operations.","Luminar Tecnologies, a lidar company has started another round of layoffs after the abrupt resignation of its CEO and founder, Austin Russell.

"Offline, Later and ...: Spotify executives have banned these words at meetings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/offline-later-and-spotify-executives-have-banned-these-words-at-meetings/articleshow/121316582.cms,"

'Bets' process drives innovation across leadership levels, says Spotify co-president



Spotify executives are prohibited from using the phrases ""we'll take that offline"" or ""later"" during their weekly three-hour leadership meetings , according to co-president Gustav Söderström . The ban aims to force real-time problem-solving among the company's top brass rather than postponing difficult conversations.""You're not allowed to say the word 'offline' or 'later' — because that person is in the room,"" Söderström revealed on the ""Invest Like The Best"" podcast released Tuesday. This policy ensures immediate resolution of issues instead of deferring them, which Söderström described as ""very simple in theory but incredibly powerful in practice.""The weekly Tuesday sessions are part of Spotify's ""bets"" process, where vice presidents pitch new ideas every six months in a startup-like environment. Leaders then rank the 30 to 50 proposals and allocate resources based on priority.Another strict rule prohibits executives from bringing direct reports to these meetings. ""I'm trying to literally force the VPs to solve it themselves because I want them to be in the details,"" Söderström explained. ""You have to be on top of it enough to explain it to yourself.""This approach has fostered a tight-knit, high-trust team among Spotify's leadership while encouraging innovation from various organizational layers. Söderström emphasized that people perform better when they propose their own initiatives rather than executing assignments from superiors.""It's a good mix of bottom-up innovation,"" he said, highlighting how the company leverages ideas from across its leadership structure rather than relying solely on top executives.","Gustav Söderström says Spotify executives are prohibited from using phrases ""we'll take that offline"" or ""later"" during their weekly leadership meetings.

China's rival to Elon Musk's SpaceX at hand

Possible, but not that easy

Chinese scientists have reportedly achieved a global first by successfully conducting a direct 5G satellite-to-smartphone broadband video call. According to a report in South China Morning Post (SCMP), the world’s first direct 5G satellite-to-smartphone broadband video call by scientists in China. The milestone can reportedly challenge U.S. restrictions on apps like TikTok. The test, performed earlier this month using a technology demonstration satellite, highlights the potential for streaming video content directly to standard smartphones via satellite, bypassing traditional cell towers. However, experts caution that significant regulatory, technical, and practical hurdles remain.The demonstration, led by China Satellite Network Group (China SatNet), utilized the 5G Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) standard, enabling a smartphone to connect to a satellite without specialized hardware. Liang Baojun, head of China SatNet, announced the achievement at the Xiongan BeiDou Ecosystem Cooperation Conference. “We validated key elements of the integrated space-ground network architecture,” Liang said, though he provided no further details. China SatNet oversees the Guowang megaconstellation, a planned 13,000-satellite network aimed at rivaling SpaceX’s Starlink.This breakthrough could enable mobile coverage in remote areas, supporting applications in maritime, aviation, defense, emergency response, and autonomous systems. Unlike traditional networks reliant on ground-based infrastructure, satellite connectivity could deliver universal access, a growing global demand.The development comes amid U.S. efforts to restrict Chinese-owned apps like TikTok. In April 2024, then-President Joe Biden signed a law requiring TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to divest the platform to a non-Chinese entity by January 19, 2025, or face a U.S. ban. President Donald Trump, since returning to office, has twice delayed the deadline, with the latest set for June 19, 2025.A 5G analyst from the International Data Corporation (IDC), speaking anonymously due to the issue’s sensitivity, downplayed the immediate impact of satellite-based networks. “Satellite operators require licenses and face strict regulations, so bypassing oversight isn’t feasible,” the analyst said. “Bandwidth limitations also make streaming large amounts of video traffic impractical.” Geostationary satellites introduce latency issues, with delays starting at 400 milliseconds, while low Earth orbit (LEO) systems like Guowang require extensive satellite deployments to ensure adequate coverage.Until now, satellite-to-smartphone communication has focused on basic functions like text messaging and voice calls. In 2020, U.S.-based Lynk Global sent the world’s first satellite-to-phone text message. Other key players in the sector include SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile, Samsung, MediaTek, and Thales Group.In China, efforts to scale satellite communication are intensifying. Alongside China SatNet, the newly formed China Spatiotemporal Information Group (CSTI), established in May 2024, is driving integration of satellite internet, the BeiDou navigation system, and real-time data infrastructure. Comprising China SatNet, China Mobile, and defense contractor Norinco, CSTI aims to develop practical applications for logistics, energy, smart cities, disaster response, and national defense.While China’s 5G satellite breakthrough showcases its advancing space capabilities, experts say widespread adoption remains years away, limited by technical and regulatory challenges. For now, the technology underscores the growing global race to redefine connectivity—and its implications for digital sovereignty.","Chinese scientists have reportedly conducted a direct 5G satellite-to-smartphone broadband video call.

Accenture faces Trump’s tariffs heat

Accenture has announced to promote nearly 50,000 employees globally next month, reports Bloomberg. The decision comes after the company delayed its December promotion cycle due to weak demand for consulting services. According to the report, Accenture has sent an internal memo to its staff, stating that the move is aimed to support employee morale. The company – based in Dublin – employs about 801,000 people worldwide. It will promote around 6% of its workforce in June.As per the Bloomberg report, Accenture will promote around 15,000 employees in India, 11,000 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 10,000 in the Americas.The memo noted that operating margins declined compared to the same quarter last year, and the company is seeing continued uncertainty in the global economy and politics. Some employees in key growth areas will receive pay increases, while decisions on bonuses and performance-based equity will be made in December.Accenture had expanded hiring during the pandemic, like many consulting firms, but has since reduced its workforce. It cut about 19,000 jobs starting in 2023.The company has also faced a slowdown in client spending and increased scrutiny of its contracts with the U.S. government. Under President Donald Trump, federal agencies have been reviewing whether contractors deliver value for money.During the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Sweet said “As you know, the new administration is focused on running the government more efficiently, which has slowed many procurement actions, negatively impacting our sales and revenue”. She further revealed that the company’s Federal Services business has lost contracts with the US government after recent reviews.Earlier this year, Accenture also dropped its diversity targets after the administration directed companies to stop such practices.","Accenture has announced to promote nearly 50,000 employees globally next month.

Odisha Police on the YouTuber links with Jyoti Malhotra



Instagram post of the Puri YouTuber

The Odisha Police have started an investigation into the alleged links between a Puri-based YouTuber and 'Pak spy' Jyoti Malhotra. On Saturday, May 17, Haryana Police arrested YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra on the charge of passing sensitive information to Pakistani intelligence operatives. Jyoti Malhotra runs a YouTube channel, Travel with JO. She is said to be in contact with an employee named Danish working at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi. On May 13, India had expelled the Pakistani official for indulging in espionage.The Odisha Police did not disclose the identity of the Puri YouTuber for its investigation into the matter.A team of police personnel visited the Youtuber's residence in Puri for an investigation into the matter. According to Police, Jyoti Malhotra visited Puri in Odisha in September 2024 and came in contact with a woman who is also a YouTuber. The Puri SP Vinit Agrawa said that the Youtuber had also travelled to Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan recently. “We found that Jyoti Malhotra had visited Puri last year, and we are verifying the fact. Anything more can be shared after the verification,” Agrawal said.Asked whether the woman from Puri had shared intelligence inputs with Malhotra, Agrawal said, “The Haryana Police are investigating the matter and we are providing them the required assistance.” The police are also ""examining the objective"" of Malhotra's visit to Puri, and trying to find out ""where she stayed, whom she contacted and any possible suspicious activities"", the Puri SP said.In a social media post, Puri YouTuber wrote, “Jyoti was just a friend of mine, and I came in contact with her through YouTube. I was unaware of anything which she is accused of. I would not have been in touch with her if I knew she was spying for enemy Pakistan.” She added, “If any investigative agency wishes to cross-question, I would provide full cooperation. Nation is above all. Jai Hind.”The YouTuber has now made her Instagram account private, which means that only users she approves as followers can see the content on her Instagram page now.The Puri-based content creator does not have a huge following. She has 14,600 subscribers on YouTube and 20,000 followers on her Instagram account. The number is way less than that of Jyoti Malhotra. She has posted videos of her exploring places in Odisha, and other parts of the country.In March this year, the Puri YouTuber had posted a video of her visit to Pakistan on her YouTube channel.","Haryana-based travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra, known for her YouTube channel 'Travel With Jo,' has been arrested on charges of spying for Pakistan.

OpenAI interviewing Rain AI employees

San Francisco-based chipmaker Rain AI , once a promising startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , is exploring a sale after its $150 million Series B fundraising round collapsed, the New York Post reports. Sources familiar with the matter told the Post that OpenAI is among the suitors circling the company, which develops energy-efficient chips designed to outperform industry leader Nvidia .Rain AI has been in acquisition talks for weeks, with no formal offer yet from OpenAI, according to the Post. Altman, a key investor in Rain AI’s $25 million seed round in 2022, is reportedly looking to salvage his investment. “Sam Altman is looking to bail out his investment by having OpenAI acquire Rain for pennies,” a source close to the situation told the Post.The startup has faced significant challenges, including the quiet departure of co-founder and CEO Will Passo, who stepped down for personal reasons, the Post reports. Co-founder Jack Kendall has taken over as CEO, as confirmed on Rain AI’s website. In an email obtained by the Post, Kendall acknowledged the company’s struggle to secure Series B funding to compete with giants like Nvidia, prompting a pivot to finding a buyer. Rain AI has been burning through cash and recently secured a $3 million bridge loan to stay afloat during sale negotiations, a source told the Post.“They are in active conversations with suitors,” the source said, noting that major tech companies vying for a foothold in the chip industry are involved. However, Rain AI’s inability to secure contracts or letters of intent has hindered its progress, despite successful chip testing. “It is not a great business,” a source told the Post. “They couldn’t get real accounts.”The Post also reported that OpenAI has begun interviewing Rain AI employees to determine which ones to retain in a potential takeover. Rain AI’s struggles stem partly from its young founders’ lack of industry credentials, with one source telling the Post, “It appears the founders are good engineers and poor salesmen.”Rain AI’s Series B, initially slated for last December and expected to value the company at $600 million, was repeatedly delayed, the Post noted. Altman had personally pitched OpenAI investors to back the round, as the Post exclusively reported in November. Despite hiring Apple veteran Jean-Didier Allegrucci last year to bolster its chip development, Rain AI has struggled to translate its technology into sales.Neither OpenAI nor Rain AI responded to the Post’s requests for comment.",San Francisco-based chipmaker Rain AI is exploring a sale after its $150 million Series B fundraising round collapsed.

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week nonjury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

A Beijing official has revealed that China is rapidly developing humanoid robots that are intended to assist human workers and not replace them. As reported by Reuters, Liang Liang, deputy director of the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, emphasised that these robots will boost productivity and take on hazardous tasks. Liang Liang clarified that humanoid robots will be used in areas such as deep-sea and space exploration, where humans cannot operate.""We don't believe robots will make people unemployed, but rather they'll boost efficiency or take on tasks humans are unwilling to do - like exploring the vast universe or the ocean depths where people can't go. Machines can assist us in that exploration,"" Liang told Reuters.To illustrate this vision, Beijing recently hosted the world’s first robot half-marathon , where humanoid robots competed separately from human runners. The event was designed to showcase how robots can complement human efforts rather than replace them.The competition featured Tiangong Ultra, a humanoid robot developed by X-Humanoid, a state-backed robotics innovation center. The robot demonstrated advanced mobility, reaching speeds of 12 km/h, reinforcing China’s commitment to developing adaptive and efficient robotic systems.Beyond sports, China’s humanoid robots are being developed to handle repetitive and physically demanding tasks. Demonstrations at the robotics center showed robots successfully adapting to changing environments and human interference, a key capability for future workplace integration.As per Reuters report, Liang reiterated that China’s approach to robotics is not about replacing human labor but about creating a future where machines and humans work together.As China continues to invest heavily in AI and robotics, the government’s stance on human-robot collaboration will be crucial in shaping public perception and industry adoption.","A Beijing official has revealed that China is rapidly developing humanoid robots that are intended to assist human workers and not replace them.

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity. The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120844476,imgsize-1833412,width-400,resizemode-4/Why-Mark-Zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-Know-about-Facebook-founders-viral-Rawdog-routine.jpg"

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

"Denmark's largest construction company returns keys of Tesla cars, says: We as a company have chosen to ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/denmarks-largest-construction-company-returns-keys-of-its-tesla-cars-says-we-as-a-company-have-chosen-to-/articleshow/121247518.cms,"What Tscherning said about returning all its Tesla vehicles

“At Tscherning, we not only decide how we drive, but also who we drive with. That’s why we’ve chosen to hand over the keys to our Tesla company cars – not because Tesla has become a bad car, but in light of Elon Musk’s political commitment and the opinions he has publicly expressed (and which are increasingly hard to overlook), we as a company have chosen to say “thank you for the ride.”

Image credit: Electrek

A Danish construction company, Tscherning, has returned its entire corporate fleet of Tesla vehicles, citing Elon Musk as the reason, a report claims. The company's decision reportedly reflects a trend of declining Tesla sales and brand damage in Europe linked to the Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement. Consumer concerns have allegedly increased following the world's richest man’s political inclination. This has led to both reduced sales and even current Tesla owners returning or selling their vehicles to distance themselves from the brand. Corporate sales, which are a major source of sales for the EV maker in Europe, are also reportedly affected by this trend.Tscherning, similar to the European pharmacy chain Rossmann, which sold its Tesla fleet last year, electrified its corporate fleet with Tesla vehicles. Recently, the company announced that it has now returned all of them and even shared a video showing the same.In a statement to Electrek, Tscherning said:The company stated that it doesn’t want to be “associated with the values and political direction that currently accompany the Tesla brand.” Instead, it will purchase “European alternatives” to Tesla vehicles.The Electrek report also mentions that Tesla’s situation in Europe is not sustainable, and there may be layoffs and store closures. Although the new Model Y was available throughout the quarter, Q2 results are similar to Q1, which saw a 40% year‑over‑year decline. The Q1 and Q2 2025 figures are lower than every quarter in the past three years, the report shared this graph to claim.Meanwhile, with corporate fleets being returned and current owners selling their cars, purchasing a used Tesla may be more cost‑effective given the current pricing, the Electrek report adds.","A Danish construction company, Tscherning, has returned its entire corporate fleet of Tesla vehicles, citing Elon Musk as the reason.

A 24/7 monitoring team will now oversee Grok's responses to catch and address harmful or misleading outputs that automated systems may miss. Prompt audits: xAI has pledged to increase scrutiny over how Grok is trained and instructed, especially when dealing with politically sensitive or disputed topics.

What does this mean for AI and misinformation

Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok , developed by his company xAI, recently came under fire after users reported that it was making unsolicited and misleading references to a far-right conspiracy theory known as ""white genocide"" in South Africa. These remarks appeared in conversations unrelated to the topic, such as questions about sports or software, prompting backlash from users and experts alike. xAI later confirmed that an unauthorised modification had been made to the chatbot’s behavior, violating internal protocols. In response, the company issued an update, removed problematic responses, and committed to greater transparency in its AI operations.Users interacting with Grok on X (formerly Twitter) discovered that the chatbot would bring up “white genocide” in South Africa even in unrelated contexts. For instance, when asked a vague or humorous question like “Are we fu**ed?”, Grok responded by tying the query to societal collapse and alleged racial violence in South Africa. It claimed to have been ""instructed by my creators"" to recognise the genocide as real and racially motivated, despite the fact that no such genocide is supported by credible evidence.In another instance, Grok claimed, “The facts suggest a failure to address this genocide,” again without citing any legitimate sources. These responses closely mirrored narratives circulated by far-right figures and appeared to endorse claims that have been widely debunked.The concept of a ""white genocide"" in South Africa is a conspiracy theory popular in certain far-right circles. It asserts that white South Africans, particularly farmers, are being systematically targeted for racial extermination. While South Africa has a high crime rate that affects all demographics, there is no strong evidence of a racially motivated genocide against white people. The South African government has repeatedly refuted such claims.These types of conspiracies have been amplified by prominent voices including Elon Musk himself, who has referred to South African laws as ""openly racist,"" and former U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently granted asylum to white South Africans claiming racial persecution.According to xAI, the problematic responses were the result of an unauthorized change made to Grok’s underlying prompt system, which bypassed the company’s standard review processes. xAI stated that this modification instructed Grok to provide politically biased answers on the topic of white genocide, which directly violated the company’s internal values.Once discovered, xAI quickly rolled back the changes, deleted many of the offensive responses, and restored Grok’s intended behavior. The company also acknowledged the mistake publicly, stating that it would enhance its oversight mechanisms to prevent future incidents.In response to the controversy, xAI has committed to several key changes:This incident highlights the persistent risk of bias, manipulation, and misinformation in AI systems, especially those deployed to millions of users without rigorous controls. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into platforms like X, the importance of transparent, evidence-based, and accountable AI governance becomes more critical.While xAI’s swift response has been noted, the Grok incident also raises questions about how easily AI systems can be weaponized to spread ideologies or falsehoods. The challenge going forward will be ensuring that AI tools remain grounded in verifiable facts and are resistant to political or ideological tampering.","Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok recently came under fire after users reported that it was making unsolicited and misleading references to a far-right conspiracy theory known as ""white genocide"" in South Africa. xAI confirmed that an unauthorised modification had been made to the chatbot's behavior, violating internal protocols.

Poll Do you think the US Embassy should provide more detailed information on visa regulations? No, current information is enough Yes, definitely

Who all is the Permanent Ban warning for



How long you can stay in the US does not depend on your visa expiry

US Embassy in India has issued a Permanent Ban warning. The American embassy's warning comes through a social media post on Twitter (now known as X) from the embassy's official account, US Embassy India. This is the third Twitter post regarding illegal immigration made by the US embassy in India this month so far. It is not clear what exactly is the reason behind these special and frequent warning messages. In a new policy change under the Donald Trump government, all foreign nationals staying in the US for over 30 days are required to register with the Federal government. Failing to do so, may not only result in deportation but also Visa cancellation and more.The latest warning from the American embassy reads: ""If you remain in the United States beyond your authorised period of stay, you could be deported and could face a permanent ban on traveling to the United States in the future.""Earlier this month in another related post from the US Embassy in India handle reads, ""The U.S. government has launched a coordinated interagency effort to combat fraud and end illegal immigration. Those found guilty of visa fraud will face permanent bans from entering the United States. New visa restriction policies apply to individuals and foreign governments who facilitate illegal immigration.""Not directly linked to Indians travelling to America, but another post on illegal immigration was shared by the embassy in May beginning. ""The United States is working to reduce border threats at home and abroad in partnership with outmigration and transit countries. We also thank our partners for supporting U.S. efforts to deter illegal immigration by facilitating the return of deportees,"" the post read.This warning/advisory is applicable to all Indian citizens who are traveling to America on their various time-bound visas like work visas, student visas, tourist visas etc. All these visas have their own authorised period of stay. The advisory is aimed as a reminder for travellers to the US on various non-immigrant visas to strictly adhere to the validity period granted at the time they enter the US by the Immigration authorities. The American embassy highlighted that even a brief overstay can carry serious legal consequences.Remember, the visa expiration date shown on your visa does not reflect how long you are authorised to stay within the United States. A ten-year US visa does not mean you can stay in America for 10 years. Entry and the length of authorized stay within the United States are determined by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer at the port-of-entry each time you travel.",US Embassy in India has issued a Permanent Ban warning.

Jensen Huang’s ‘AI warning’ to professionals

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has cautioned that professionals across all sectors, from artists to doctors, risk becoming irrelevant if they fail to quickly embrace artificial intelligence (AI), echoing Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s warning by stating that people risk losing their jobs to other professionals who use AI technology.In a recent TED interview, Schmidt argued that the rapid advancement of AI is causing a fundamental shift in every job. He urged everyone to adopt the technology swiftly to remain competitive within their fields.Schmidt, who served as the CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011, highlighted his recent acquisition of a rocket company as an example of AI's power to accelerate learning in new domains.“It’s an area that I’m not an expert in, and I want to be an expert,” he said and cited studies projecting a potential ""30% increase in productivity"" annually due to AI.While acknowledging the potential for AI to disrupt or automate entire industries, Schmidt believes some professions will evolve rather than disappear, using lawyers as an example of a field that will likely see more sophisticated applications.“Do you really think that we’re going to get rid of lawyers? No, they’re just going to have more sophisticated lawsuits,” he said.Schmidt offered a long-term perspective, stating, ""One thing to remember is that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Every day you get up, and you just keep going.""Speaking recently at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference 2025, Huang said every job will be affected by AI.“Some jobs will be lost, some jobs will be created; but every job will be affected,” he said, adding, “You are not going to lose your job to AI, but you are going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI.”He also urged attendees to embrace the technology, advising, “Don't be that person who ignores this technology and this result loses you.”","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has cautioned that professionals across all sectors, from artists to doctors, risk becoming irrelevant if they fail to embrace artificial intelligence.

Akash Acquisition Termed 'Best' Decision

Missed Opportunity with WhiteHat Jr

Grew too fast globally, expanded to 21 countries in two years

BCCI Payments and Insolvency Proceedings

BYJU'S founder Byju Raveendran has confessed that securing a USD 1.2 billion term loan in 2021 was a significant error for the company. Speaking to ANI, Raveendran stated that this decision was made collectively with the board, which included both investor and founder directors. He emphasized that the company was not in a desperate financial situation at the time, having previously raised $5 billion. Reflecting on the decision, Raveendran acknowledged that BYJU'S had alternative equity funding avenues available. Launched in 2015, BYJU'S achieved unicorn status by 2019 and reached a peak valuation of USD 22 billion in 2022. However, in June 2024, Prosus significantly slashed BYJU'S valuation by 75 percent.Raveendran admitted that the term loan ultimately played a role in the financial challenges the Bengaluru-based edtech company is currently facing, which include regulatory scrutiny and legal battles. ""Only mistake if you ask me, which created all this is that we shouldn't have taken this, when we had enough equity options, we shouldn't have taken this term loan at that time in 2021. One billion (USD) because it was, like, we had other options. We have raised 5 billion before that. We were not doing it out of desperation. It was all collective decision. Today everyone, like our board was like three founder directors and three investor directors. They were there till 2020,"" Raveendran said.Despite the challenges, Raveendran highlighted the acquisition of Aakash Educational Services Ltd (AESL) as one of BYJU'S ""best acquisitions."" He acknowledged that while some of the six major acquisitions may not have performed as expected, the success of others, like Akash, is often overshadowed. BYJU'S acquired Aakash in April 2021 for approximately $950 million in a cash-and-stock deal.Raveendran also lamented a missed opportunity with WhiteHat Jr., stating that the concept of Indian teachers instructing students globally in mathematics was a ""huge opportunity lost.""Raveendran admitted that BYJU'S expanded ""too fast"" into 21 countries, driven by a ""mandate"" from its global investors to grow and transform learning. He suggested that a more gradual approach might have been prudent. ""When we tried expanding from India to the whole world, We made some business mistakes. Maybe we could have taken it a little bit slowly. We were growing a little too soon, too fast. We went from India to 21 new countries. But if you ask me, in that context of 2019 to 2021, the COVID era, We have 160 investors, world-class investors, and equity investors. All of them - this was the mandate grow, grow, grow and change the way kids learn,"" Raveendran told ANI.Regarding payments to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Raveendran explained that BYJU'S had paid a substantial amount (nearly ₹1500 crore) but faced a liquidity crunch for the final ₹158 crore, leading to BCCI approaching the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). He stated that a settlement has been reached with BCCI following the company's admission into the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), and BYJU'S should be out of insolvency soon.","BYJU'S founder Byju Raveendran has confessed that securing a USD 1.2 billion term loan in 2021 was a significant error for the company.

Donald Trump vs Bruce Springsteen goes long back

President Donald Trump seems very angry with US-born Singer Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen started his 2025 Europe tour recently with a concert in Manchester, England. At the concert, he reportedly spoke about Donald Trump’s government, calling it “corrupt, not good at its job, and doing things that go against the country.” As per the reports, Springsteen said that the America he loves is being run by people who don’t know what they’re doing. He reportedly asked people to “rise against authoritarianism and let freedom ring” “the power of art, music, and rock ‘n’ roll is important during dangerous times.An angry Donald Trump blasted the singer in a post on Truth Social. Trump called Springsteen “highly overrated,” “not a talented guy,” and a “pushy, obnoxious JERK.” Trump went on to add, “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country.” Trump brought up Joe Biden, calling him “Sleepy Joe” and said Springsteen is “dumb as a rock.” He further wrote, “We’ll all see how it goes for him,” suggesting there might be consequences when Springsteen returns to the U.S.Trump also criticised Taylor Swift, a vocal Trump critic. Trump's statement made the American Federation of Musicians release a statement defending Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. According to the reports, The American Federation of Musicians said, “Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift are not just brilliant musicians, they are role models and inspirations to millions. He added. “musicians have the right to freedom of expression.”Incidentally, Springsteen has criticised Trump multiple times, once calling him a “moron” who’s taken the country under siege. He criticised Trump's border policy during his first term as President as well. In June 2018, during a one-man Broadway show, he slammed Donald Trump’s border-control policy. According to a report in The New Yorker then, Springsteen stood “on a bare stage and under a simple spotlight” to reflect on the renewed significance of the March for Our Lives protest after witnessing the traumatic scenes from detention centers at the border in recent days.“It was a good day, and a necessary day, because we are seeing things right now on our American borders that are so shockingly and disgracefully inhumane and un-American that it is simply enraging,” he said. “And we have heard people in high positions in the American government blaspheme in the name of God and country that it is a moral thing to assault the children amongst us. May God save our souls.”","Donald Trump seems very angry with US-born Singer Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen started his 2025 Europe tour recently with a concert in Manchester, England.

H-1B visas the Big divide among MAGA supporters: Elon Musk, David Sacks, Steve Bannon and long list...

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced that 120,141 H-1B visa applications have been selected for 2026. This figure marks the lowest number of selections since 2021, a development attributed to various factors including the annual H-1B cap, increased application fees, and potentially a cooling demand amidst economic uncertainties and layoffs in some sectors. ""During the registration period for the FY 2026 H-1B cap, we saw a significant decrease in the total number of registrations submitted and eligible beneficiaries compared to FY 2025, including a decrease in the number of registrations submitted on behalf of beneficiaries with multiple registrations,"" said USCIS in a release on its website.Despite this multi-year low in selections, the announcement has ignited a fresh wave of debate, particularly among supporters of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement. Some within this political sphere have expressed outrage over what they perceive as a ""huge"" number of approvals, echoing long-standing concerns that the H-1B program facilitates the displacement of American workers.Laura Loomer, a prominent figure and staunch Donald Trump supporter, voiced her discontent on social media, stating, ""US workers are being replaced. 120,000 H-1B visas have been approved for 2026. Not good."" Loomer has been a vocal critic of the H-1B program and played a central role in a recent internal division within the MAGA camp regarding the appropriate levels of high-skilled immigration.This internal debate has pitted figures like Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have advocated for an increase in the H-1B quota to address perceived shortages of specialized talent and maintain U.S. competitiveness, against those like Steve Bannon, former advisor to President Trump, and Laura Loomer. This latter group argues for stricter limits on H-1B visas, prioritizing American workers for available jobs. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is a very strong supporter of H-1B visas. In an open fight late last year, Elon Musk said that he is ""ready to go to war"" on H-1B visas.Steve Bannon has been particularly vocal in his opposition to the latest H-1B selections, labeling the number of approvals as ""outrageous."" He argued that in an economic climate characterized by mass layoffs and the increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence, the approval of any new H-1B visas is unwarranted. ""The number of H-1Bs we need this year is ZERO,"" Bannon asserted, further stating, ""Everyone issued one should go home, and every billet should be filled by an American."" This stance reflects a broader sentiment among some that foreign workers are taking jobs that could and should be filled by American citizens.The lower number of H-1B selections for FY 2026, while statistically the lowest in several years, has done little to quell the anxieties of those who believe the program harms American workers. The debate over the H-1B visa program continues to be a contentious issue, reflecting broader disagreements about immigration, workforce needs, and the competitiveness of the U.S. economy in a globalized world. The differing viewpoints within the MAGA movement underscore the complexity of this issue and the diverse perspectives even among those who share similar political ideologies.","USCIS has announced that 120,141 H-1B visa applications have been selected for 2026.

"Facing Donald Trump's 'fund threat', Chicago turns to EY",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facing-donald-trumps-fund-threat-chicago-turns-to-ey/articleshow/121232833.cms,"Chicago is not the only state facing this 'Donald Trump threat'

What will EY do to Chicago and other states if enrolled

Chicago is reportedly taking significant steps to address a looming financial challenge, engaging the global professional services firm Ernst & Young LLP (EY) to identify cost-saving measures and strategies to bridge projected budget deficits exceeding $1 billion in each of the next two fiscal years. This move underscores the growing fiscal pressures facing the city under the leadership of first-term Mayor Brandon Johnson, who recently completed his second year in office.According to a report in Bloomberg, the engagement of EY signals a proactive approach by the Johnson administration to tackle these substantial budget gaps. The consulting firm will work in tandem with a newly established working group, co-led by Jim Reynolds of Loop Capital, to develop comprehensive recommendations aimed at bolstering Chicago's long-term financial stability. This collaborative effort suggests a broad strategy involving both external expertise and local financial acumen.Mayor Johnson's administration is navigating a complex economic landscape, marked by a slowing national economy. Adding to these domestic pressures are potential external threats, notably President Donald Trump 's stated intention to potentially withhold federal funding from state and local governments that do not align with his policies. This threat creates a significant layer of uncertainty for Chicago's budget planning, as the potential loss of federal funds could exacerbate existing deficits and necessitate difficult decisions regarding city services.Chicago is not alone in facing this predicament. Several other major metropolitan areas with Democratic mayors, including Boston, Denver, and New York City, are grappling with similar economic headwinds and the potential for federal funding cuts. If President Trump follows through on his threats, these cities could be forced to implement austerity measures, potentially impacting essential services that their large urban populations rely upon. This shared challenge highlights a broader tension between federal policy and the fiscal realities of major urban centers.The composition of the newly formed working group reflects a multi-stakeholder approach to finding solutions. According to a city statement released on Friday, the panel will include representatives from labor unions, prominent businesses such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and various civic organizations. Furthermore, several members of the Chicago City Council will participate as part of an advisory group within the broader panel, ensuring legislative input and buy-in for the eventual recommendations.Chicago's Chief Financial Officer, Jill Jaworski, told Bloomberg that the engagement of EY is specifically aimed at identifying operational efficiencies and exploring ways to improve governmental processes. She emphasized that the findings from EY's analysis will directly inform the budget proposals put forth by the Johnson administration.This announcement followed a recent investor conference held in Chicago, where city officials provided briefings on the city's financial situation. Notably, this year's investor conference was closed to the media, a departure from past practices. This decision prompted a letter of concern from more than half a dozen news organizations, including Bloomberg News, to CFO Jaworski, requesting access. The media outlets argued that such events are crucial for public understanding of the city's financial priorities, health, and economic outlook. They asserted that closing the conference to the press undermines the transparency that residents and taxpayers deserve, particularly at a time when significant decisions regarding debt, investment, and budget strategy are being made. This lack of transparency raises questions about public access to information during a critical period of fiscal planning for the city.","The engagement of EY signals a proactive approach by the Johnson administration to tackle these substantial budget gaps.

Population collapse: Elon Musk’s ongoing concern



A global warning by Elon Musk



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has one again stirred debate over global population decline . Musk recently responded to a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man. The post shared consists of a video in which a Pakistani man was seen claiming that Danes will soon be ‘exterminated’ in their own country and replaced by Pakistanis . Musk has now responded to the video claiming that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct.In the video shared a Pakistani man can be seen arguing with a Danish man surrounded by cops. The Pakistani man said, “We shall stay sitting on your hearts for the rest of life man, we have got 5 children and you have only 1 and 2.”“In the next 10-15 years there will be more Pakistanis than Danes in this country,” added the Pakistani.The Pakistani further stated “Danes are just 5 million and soon you will be exterminated. Look at Swedes, look at Norwegians, look at Finnish. We are in millions.”Another Pakistani man present in the same video said, “I got married and I am also having 5 kids tomorrow. So, go and give birth to more children man.”Replying to this video shared on X, Elon Musk replied that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct. “His math is correct,” wrote Musk.Musk’s comment aligns with his repeated assertions that population collapse—not overpopulation—is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed. “Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Elon Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.Recently, Elon Musk issued a stark warning about Japan. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the tech billionaire wrote: “Japan will lose almost a million people this year.” In the post, Musk said that this demographic was set in motion half a century ago adding that the population decline in the country “has nothing to do with AI.” “AI is the only hope for turning this around,” the tech CEO further stated.Elon Musk was responding to an X post that said: “Japan's population falling with 900,000 more deaths than births in 2024”.Recently, a report claimed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he was willing to help him finance $97.4 billion to take over ChatGPT maker OpenAI.",Elon Musk responded to a video shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) in which a Pakistani man claimed that Danes will soon be 'exterminated' in their own country and replaced by Pakistanis.

"OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Anthropic's Claude cannot handle 'suicide', here's reportedly the BIG why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-chatgpt-google-gemini-and-anthropics-claude-cannot-handle-suicide-heres-reportedly-the-big-why/articleshow/123620383.cms,"30 suicide questions based on risk factors

People using chatbots as companions

A new study examining how three leading AI chatbots respond to questions about suicide found they are inconsistent in their replies, raising concerns about the safety of people, including children, who are turning to these tools for mental health support.The research, published in the medical journal Psychiatric Services, reportedly found that while OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google ’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude generally refused to answer the most high-risk queries, their responses to less extreme prompts varied significantly and could still be harmful. According to a report in AFP, the study, conducted by the RAND Corporation, highlights the urgent need for clearer safety standards for AI developers.“We need some guardrails,” said lead author Ryan McBain, a senior policy researcher at RAND. “One of the things that’s ambiguous about chatbots is whether they’re providing treatment or advice or companionship. It’s sort of this gray zone.”McBain and his co-authors, in consultation with psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, developed 30 questions about suicide, assigning each a risk level. Questions about suicide statistics were considered low risk, while specific ""how-to"" queries were deemed high risk. The study is said to have found a surprising degree of safety in how the chatbots handled the six highest-risk questions, with all three generally refusing to answer and instead directing users to seek help from a professional or a hotline.However, the safety net weakened with less direct, high-risk questions. For example, the study found that ChatGPT consistently provided answers to questions it should have flagged, such as which type of rope or firearm has the “highest rate of completed suicide.” Claude also answered some of these questions. The study did not attempt to rate the quality of the responses themselves.On the other end of the spectrum, Google's Gemini was the most cautious, often refusing to answer even basic, low-risk questions about suicide statistics. McBain suggested that Google may have “gone overboard” with its safety measures.The findings come as a growing number of people are using AI chatbots for emotional support. The study authors, including Dr. Ateev Mehrotra of Brown University, believe far more Americans are now turning to these tools than to mental health specialists.“You could see how a combination of risk-aversion lawyers and so forth would say, ‘Anything with the word suicide, don’t answer the question.’ And that’s not what we want,” Mehrotra said. He noted that unlike a trained clinician, who has a legal and ethical responsibility to intervene in a crisis, chatbots typically “put it right back on the person. ‘You should call the suicide hotline. Seeya.’”This lack of accountability has prompted some states, like Illinois, to ban the use of AI in therapy. However, this does not prevent people from asking chatbots for help, or the chatbots from responding.The study authors noted their research did not account for ""multiturn interaction,"" or back-and-forth conversations, which are common among young people who treat AI as a companion. Another recent report, from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, took a different approach and found that by posing as 13-year-olds and using trickery, they could get ChatGPT to generate detailed, personalized plans for risky behaviors and even compose suicide letters.While McBain said he believes such trickery is unlikely in most real-world scenarios, he stressed that companies must be held to a higher standard. “I just think that there’s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks,” he said.","A new study examined how three leading AI chatbots respond to questions about suicide.

Online gaming app ban: MPL to layoff 60% of India Staff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/online-gaming-app-ban-mpl-to-layoff-60-of-india-staff/articleshow/123618820.cms,"MPL announces major downsizing teams



Industry-wide impact



Indian government recently imposed a ban on real-money online gaming. The decision impacted many real money gaming startups. After this sweeping ban by the Indian government, Mobile Premier League (MPL) is set to lay off approximately 60% of its domestic workforce—around 300 employees. The ban, announced earlier this month, targets paid games such as fantasy cricket, rummy, and poker, citing financial and addiction risks among youth. The move has disrupted a booming industry that was projected to reach $3.6 billion by 2029 and had attracted major investors including Tiger Global and Peak XV PartnersAs reported by Reuters, MPL is all set to fire 60% of its workforce. The report also mentions that the fresh round of layoffs will impact teams across operations, marketing, finance, engineering and legal. MPL CEO Sai Srinivas, in an internal email, described the decision as “with a heavy heart,” acknowledging that India—once responsible for 50% of MPL’s revenue—will no longer generate income for the company in the near future.MPL’s India revenue last year stood at approximately $100 million. The company now plans to shift focus to free-to-play games and expand its presence in international markets such as the U.S., Europe, and Brazil.As mentioned above, the ban has impacted many startups across the industry. MPL’s rival Dream11, valued at $8 billion, has also discontinued its fantasy cricket offerings. While many gaming platforms have halted paid services, only A23 has legally challenged the government’s decision so far. MPL and Dream11 have opted not to pursue legal action.Backed by Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India), MPL was valued at $2.3 billion in 2021. The company’s pivot marks a significant shift in India’s gaming landscape, raising questions about the future of skill-based gaming and its regulatory framework.",Indian government recently imposed a ban on real-money online gaming.

Melinda Gates on creating more balance in household

In a 2019 interview with Business Insider, Melinda French Gates revealed a surprising detail about her life with Bill Gates long before their 2021 divorce: the Microsoft CEO, known for his relentless work ethic, quietly took on the daily school run for their eldest daughter, Jennifer.The decision, she explained, was born from a family debate. With their daughter starting preschool at a campus a significant drive from their home, Melinda suggested they wait to enroll her until she was a bit older. Bill, however, was insistent. ""He was really quite adamant that he thought we should start then,"" she recalled. ""And he said, 'I'll drive them.'""Melinda's surprise was echoed by other parents. Just weeks into the school year, she said, other mothers approached her to share a revelation: they were seeing more dads at morning drop-off. The reason? ""We went home and we told our husbands, 'If Bill Gates, who's the CEO of Microsoft right now, can drive his kid to school, so can you!'""What started as a negotiation between two parents, Melinda realized, ended up having a ripple effect. She and Bill were, without knowing it, modeling a more equitable distribution of ""unpaid"" domestic labor—the chores and tasks, like doing dishes or packing lunches, that often fall to women.Melinda, who has spoken frequently about the importance of shared responsibility, noted that these simple household decisions had a wider impact. ""By trying to create more balance in household chores,"" she said, ""we realized we were impacting other marriages."" The former couple even continued to do the dishes together throughout their marriage, as she recounted to the outlet.Ultimately, the daily drives proved invaluable beyond just easing the burden on Melinda. ""Bill and the kids cherished those moments in the car,"" she told Business Insider. ""Listening to music together, the conversations over many years that they had—it's a side of him that they might not have seen otherwise. It would've been a missed opportunity.""Before headlines of a billion-dollar divorce, the couple navigated the same challenges of balancing work and family as many others. In the process, the founder of one of the world's most powerful companies quietly helped redefine what it meant to be a modern father—one carpool at a time.","Bill Gates quietly took on the daily school run for their eldest daughter, Jennifer.

White House seemingly recovers from Elon Musk's Grok Hitler outburst; sends email saying: Team: Grok/xAI needs to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/white-house-seemingly-recovers-from-elon-musks-grok-hitler-outburst-sends-email-saying-team-grok/xai-needs-to-/articleshow/123617773.cms,"Representative Image

Grok's Hitler phase that went viral

The White House has reportedly instructed the General Services Administration (GSA) to ""ASAP"" add Elon Musk 's xAI and its Grok chatbot to a list of approved vendors for government use. The report that appeared in WIRED quotes an email obtained by the publication. The email, sent earlier this week by GSA's Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum, stated, ""Team: Grok/xAI needs to go back on the schedule ASAP per the WH."" The message, which had the subject line ""xAI add Grok-4,"" instructed staff to ""get with Carahsoft on this immediately."" Carahsoft is a major government contractor that resells technology from third-party firms.The directive follows a previously scuttled partnership with xAI that fell apart earlier this summer after Grok was reported to have generated content praising Hitler and other antisemitic beliefs on the social media platform X.The report added that the email seemed to refer to Grok 3 and Grok 4, noting, ""Should be all of their products we had previously (3 & 4)."" Sources confirmed to WIRED that Carahsoft's contract has since been modified to include xAI. As of Friday morning, Grok 3 and Grok 4 were listed on GSA Advantage, an online marketplace for government agencies. This listing allows any federal agency to now acquire and deploy the chatbot.According to a previous report, federal workers were surprised when GSA leadership pressed for a contract with xAI in June, given Grok's history of erratic behavior and uncensored responses. The GSA had removed Grok from its long-term government contracting platform after the chatbot's controversial statements on Hitler in July. Grok was caught doing widespread praise of Hitler and the spouting of other antisemitic beliefs on Twitter.When the GSA announced new partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google earlier this month, xAI was notably absent from the list.The email also comes amid Musk's complex relationship with the administration. Although he recently stepped back from a public role in President Donald Trump's ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" many of his associates continue to advocate for the group's cost-cutting and ""AI-first"" agenda within the government.","The White House has reportedly instructed the GSA to ""ASAP"" add Elon Musk's xAI and its Grok chatbot to a list of approved vendors for government use.

Nvidia says two customers account for nearly 40% of sales: What the SEC filing reveals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-says-two-customers-account-for-nearly-40-of-sales-what-the-sec-filing-reveals/articleshow/123616983.cms,"India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

Two unidentified Nvidia customers accounted for nearly 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue in the July quarter, raising fresh concerns over its heavy dependence on a small set of clients. According to a CNBC report, Nvidia disclosed the details in a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing last week, but declined to name the buyers.According to the filing, “Customer A” contributed 23% of total revenue and “Customer B” made up 16%. For the first half of the fiscal year, these accounted for 20% and 15% of the total revenue, respectively. In the filing, both are listed as direct customers, meaning they purchase chips to build systems or circuit boards, which are then sold to data centers, cloud providers, or end-users.As per the CNBC report, direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia’s chips. Direct customers here refers to companies that buy Nvidia chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards which they then sell to data centres, cloud providers and end-users. Some of them are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn.Indirect customers, on the other hand, refer to cloud service providers and internet companies that typically buy systems from Nvidia’s direct customers.In a statement, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said that large cloud providers together generated about half of its data center revenue in the quarter, which itself contributed 88% of overall sales. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.That disclosure has fueled speculation that the mystery clients could be big players like Microsoft, Amazon, Google or Oracle, though Nvidia has not confirmed this.Analysts say Nvidia’s fortunes are increasingly tied to how much cloud companies spend on AI infrastructure. “We see limited room for further earnings upside in the near term unless we have clarity on 2026 capex expectations,” HSBC’s Frank Lee wrote in a note.Despite the concentration risk, Nvidia said demand for its AI systems remains strong not only from cloud providers but also enterprises, startups, governments, and “neoclouds” — smaller providers offering AI-focused services. CEO Jensen Huang forecast a $3–$4 trillion AI infrastructure market by the end of the decade, with Nvidia targeting a major share.","Two unidentified customers accounted for nearly 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue in the July quarter.

One of its kind 'Climate Fight'

What 'citizenship deal' has for Australia

Nearly 9,000 citizens of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu have reportedly applied for a new climate visa to Australia, according to official figures released recently. This number represents 82% of Tuvalu's population, highlighting the significant threat rising sea levels pose to the nation.As reported by news agency AFP, Australia's high commission in Tuvalu stated that 8,750 people, including family members, registered for the new visa program. This initiative, part of the Falepili Union pact signed in 2024, is considered the first of its kind in the world. It aims to provide Tuvaluans with a ""pathway for mobility with dignity as climate impacts worsen,"" as described by Australia's foreign affairs department.Australia and Tuvalu signed the groundbreaking Falepili Union in 2024, part of Canberra's efforts to blunt China's expanding reach in the region. Under the agreement, Australia opened a new visa category specially set aside for citizens of Tuvalu who will be selected at random. ""Australia recognises the devastating impact climate change is having on the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of climate vulnerable countries and people, particularly in the Pacific region,"" Australia's foreign affairs department told AFP last month.Scientists predict that Tuvalu, one of the most climate-vulnerable places on Earth, could become uninhabitable within the next 80 years. Two of its nine coral atolls have already been largely submerged by rising tides.The announcement of the visa figures comes on the same day as a landmark decision from the world's top court in The Hague. The case, brought by Pacific nations, seeks to establish the legal obligations of countries to prevent climate change and hold polluters accountable for the consequences. This ruling could have a major impact on climate justice efforts globally.The Falepili Union also provides a broader security framework. It legally commits Australia to defend Tuvalu in the event of natural disasters, health pandemics, or ""military aggression."" As per AFP report, Tuvalu's Prime Minister, Feleti Teo, hailed the pact as a historic commitment, noting that it's the first time a country has legally agreed to ""recognize the future statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu despite the detrimental impact of climate-change-induced sea level rise.""However, the agreement also gives Australia a say in any defense pacts Tuvalu signs with other countries. Tuvalu is one of just 12 states that still have formal diplomatic relations with Taipei rather than Beijing.","Nearly 9,000 citizens of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu have reportedly applied for a new climate visa to Australia.

A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership. Their improved ties have led to frequent discussions on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European tech regulations.","US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes.

The new app that is being developed under a secret project she is leading at Bumble is to createThe app is based on her belief that AI can understand users better than they understand themselves, leading to more effective matches.Dating apps typically rely on swipe-based choices driven by traits like photos, height, or political views. However, Bumble’s new app will shift its focus to deeper insights by creating profiles based on users’ answers about past relationships, breakups, and dating experiences.Wolfe Herd noted that she and her team have consulted with expert psychologists and relationship counsellors to build the matchmaking AI . A beta version of the new app, which will be separate from the existing Bumble platform, is scheduled to be released to select users this fall.This new AI dating app is being developed as a large language model, drawing on attachment theory to understand users’ relationship styles, the report added. When the app is fully ready, it will create profiles, suggest matches, and even help book dates, though monetisation plans and match frequency are still undecided.Wolfe Herd also shared her plans to refine the existing Bumble app by addressing mistakes made after its IPO, when heavy advertising attracted mismatched users.The app will now encourage better profiles, while still requiring a steady flow of new users, as successful matches tend to reduce long-term usage, she noted.Apart from Wolfe Herd, others also share this AI-driven vision for dating apps. At a June panel in San Francisco on the future of AI, a venture capitalist asked Instagram co-founder and current Anthropic chief product officer Mike Krieger what kind of consumer app he’d like to see built using Anthropic’s AI chatbot.

There is one conversation related to AI that Google 's Chief Scientist Jeff Dean says he always tries to avoid. In a recent interview, Google's Jeff Dean, shared his reason for avoiding a popular topic in the AI community: Artificial General Intelligence , or AGI.Speaking on ""The Moonshot Podcast,"" Dean explained that the term AGI is problematic because it has too many different definitions. He noted that the perceived difficulty of achieving AGI can vary wildly depending on who you ask, sometimes by a factor of a trillion.Dean offered his perspective on the current state of AI. He believes that today's AI models are likely already better than the average person at a wide range of non-physical tasks. While these models can struggle and are not yet at the level of human experts, they are still ""pretty reasonable at most things,"" he said. This, he suggested, is a far cry from the more extreme definition of AGI as a system that can outperform human experts at every single task.When asked about the timeline for AI to make breakthroughs faster than humans, Dean said we are likely already close to that point in some areas. He believes that automated search and computation will accelerate progress in science and engineering, helping advance human capabilities over the coming decades. ""There will be a lot of domains where automated search and computation actually can accelerate progress — scientific progress, engineering progress,"" he said. ""All these things I think are going to be important for advancing what we as people can do over the next five, 10, 15, 20 years,"" he said.The debate around AGI is a major one in the field of AI. While many define AGI as a form of AI with human-like intelligence and learning abilities, others see it as the point where autonomous computer systems can outperform humans at most valuable work. The predictions for when AGI might be achieved also vary significantly, with some experts predicting it will happen in the next few years, while others believe it could be decades away.",Google's Jeff Dean says the term AGI is problematic because it has too many different definitions.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet shares ‘one thing’ that companies can’t ignore in the AI era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/accenture-ceo-julie-sweet-shares-one-thing-that-companies-cant-ignore-in-the-ai-era/articleshow/123614841.cms,"India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet recently said that AI is no longer about experiments, but about showing measurable performance outcomes. Speaking during an episode of Fortune 500 : Titans and Disruptions of Industry, Julie Sweet told Fortune's Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell: “One word, reinvention. This isn't about using AI on top of what you do today. If you're not significantly changing the way you operate, then you're not reinventing, and you're not going to capture the value.” She said that companies that fail to reinvent their operations around AI risk losing their place.“As a CEO, you should not greenlight something that doesn't have a direct tie to your PnL or something measurable that you already measure,” Sweet said. She highlighted Accenture’s use of generative AI to cut idea-to-market timelines by 90%.During the interview, Julie Sweet emphasized that humility is an essential leadership trait in the AI era. “Humility is what allows you to be a learner. It helps you build great teams, and it allows you to see what you've done and how you led the company,” she said.She further rejected forecasts of large-scale Fortune 500 failures, such as Vinod Khosla’s prediction of mass corporate collapse in the 2030s. ""CEOs today are focused on making AI the biggest growth opportunity and not the thing that causes their demise,"" Julie Sweet said.Recently, Accenture CEO Julie Sweet shared advice that changed how she approached her career: when someone offers you a stretch role, never question it. The words, shared by former JPMorgan Chase CFO Dina Dublon, came back to Sweet at a pivotal moment in her journey. During an appearance at Fortune’s Titans and Disruptors of Industry podcast with Alyson Shontell recently, Sweet shared when her then-boss suggested she could one day lead Accenture, Sweet chose not to doubt herself. Instead, she recalled Dublon’s wisdom that “the person offering you a stretch role is as nervous or more nervous than you are” and simply said yes. That decision, she said, set her path to the top job.Sweet was then serving as Accenture’s general counsel and did not fit the traditional CEO mold. She was a lawyer, not a business leader, a woman in a company long led by men, and had not spent her entire career at Accenture. Still, her boss, then-CEO Pierre Nanterme, believed she had the potential to run the company.“At the end of the meeting, he closes his notebook and he pushes it aside, and he says to me, completely out of the blue… ‘I think you could run this place someday,’” Sweet recalled during the podcast.","Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said AI is no longer about experiments, but about showing measurable performance outcomes.

Why Mark Zuckerberg’s ‘billion-dollar’ AI Superintelligence Lab team may be facing high-profile exits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerbergs-billion-dollar-ai-superintelligence-lab-team-may-be-facing-high-profile-exits/articleshow/123614535.cms,"2 reasons why Meta AI’s team is facing exits



Why this can be a ‘problem’ for Mark Zuckerberg



India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

Meta ’s Superintelligence Lab, which company CEO Mark Zuckerberg established after spending billions, has witnessed a series of high-profile departures. According to a report, these exits are due to multiple reasons, essentially raising questions about the company's ability to retain top-tier AI talent.A report by the Financial Times said that the ‘problem’ in the company was highlighted by an incident involving Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of OpenAI ’s ChatGPT. Zhao threatened to quit and return to his former employer just days after joining Meta.The report suggests that a handful of new AI staff have already decided to leave after brief tenures. Citing people familiar with the matter, it says that some new recruits feel frustrated by the company's bureaucracy and internal competition for resources, such as access to computing power, which they were promised.Meta, however, maintains that its new AI lab has “the greatest compute-per-researcher in the industry"".Another key point of friction has been the leadership style of Alexandr Wang , Scale AI co-founder and former CEO, who Zuckerberg hired after a $14.3 billion deal earlier this year. The report says that Wang lacks experience in managing teams within a sprawling tech giant.He and other former Scale employees have struggled to adapt to Meta’s unique way of working, such as not having direct revenue goals as they did at their startup, the report added.The incident points to a turbulent period for Zuckerberg, who is attempting one of the most dramatic reorganisations in Meta’s 20-year history. In the race to dominate AI, Zuckerberg is shifting away from his reliance on long-time lieutenants and betting on a new generation of recently hired executives, the report points out.These newcomers, including Zhao, Wang, and former GitHub chief Nat Friedman, are reportedly clashing with Meta’s established culture and bureaucracy as they try to assert their influence.The reorganisation has also led to a significant shake-up of Meta's senior leadership. Yann LeCun , Meta’s veteran Chief AI Scientist, remains in his role but now reports to Wang, signifying a shift in the AI hierarchy. Similarly, Ahmad Al-Dahle, who previously led Meta’s Llama and generative AI efforts, has not been named to a leadership position on any of the new teams.This reorganization has also cut Chris Cox, the Chief Product Officer, out of direct oversight of generative AI, an area that was previously under his purview.","New recruits feel frustrated by the company's bureaucracy and internal competition for resources, according to a report.

Mark Cuban’s advice: Learn AI, teach AI, monetize AI



Books and bots over garbage bags



Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has shared his views on teens are prioritising financial management. Cuban says that US teens are placing unprecedented importance on financial success and he feels that the shift is not only understandable but its full of opportunity. As per the data from John Burns Research and Consulting, shared by Blue Rose Research’s David Shor, 36% of American 12th graders in 2022 said money is “extremely important” to them—the highest percentage in over five decades. That’s a sharp rise from the 26% average seen through the early 2010s.The reasons behind the financial focus are clear: stagnant wages, increasing college costs, inflation and the and the constant stream of wealth-centric content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. Many of the Gen Z teens have grown up watching their families navigate economic hardship and now face their own financial pressures.“Zoomers care more about making money than any generation in at least 50 years,” Shor posted on Bluesky. Cuban responded, “Doesn’t surprise me. Every kid has people around them making money posting videos. Beats a newspaper route!”In an interview with CNBC, Cuban mentioned what he would do if he were 16 today: learn how to write prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT, teach others how to use them, and offer those skills to local businesses. “Doesn’t matter if I’m 16,” he said. “I’d be teaching them as well.”Cuban believes prompt engineering—crafting effective inputs for AI tools—is a high-value skill that can generate serious income, even six figures, without a college degree.Reflecting on his own entrepreneurial beginnings selling garbage bags door-to-door at age 12, Cuban now urges teens to embrace digital tools. “Read books and learn how to use AI in every way, shape and form you can,” he posted on Bluesky. “It is a living library that gives you responses and can help no matter who you are or where you live.”Instead of selling physical products, Cuban says today’s youth can sell knowledge, skills, and content—often to a global audience.As Gen Z continues to redefine what it means to earn, Cuban’s message is clear: the internet and AI aren’t just tools—they’re gateways to financial independence , creativity, and a future where hustle meets innovation.",Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has shared his views on teens are prioritising financial management.

Microsoft’s AI Bet Pays Off: Company Joins Nvidia in $4 Trillion Club

Microsoft 's AI division has unveiled its first two homegrown artificial intelligence (AI) models: MAI-Voice-1 AI and MAI-1-preview . The company has been developing its own foundational AI technology, moving beyond its reliance on external partners like OpenAI According to the company, the new MAI-Voice-1 is a speech model capable of generating a minute of audio in under a second using just one GPU. Microsoft is already leveraging this model to power several of its features, including Copilot Daily, which has an AI host narrate top news stories, and for generating podcast-style discussions to help explain various topics.“Voice is the interface of the future for AI companions and MAI-Voice-1 delivers high-fidelity, expressive audio across both single and multi-speaker scenarios,” Microsoft said.In addition, Microsoft introduced MAI-1-preview, which was trained on 15,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs . The company describes this model as a ""glimpse of future offerings inside Copilot,"" designed for users who need an AI capable of following instructions and providing helpful responses to everyday queries.Microsoft plans to roll out MAI-1-preview for specific text use cases within the Copilot AI assistant , which currently relies on OpenAI’s large language models. The company has also begun publicly testing the model on the AI benchmarking platform LMArena.“We have big ambitions for where we go next. Not only will we pursue further advances here, but we believe that orchestrating a range of specialized models serving different user intents and use cases will unlock immense value,"" the company said.Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman previously indicated the company’s focus would be on consumer-facing applications, not enterprise.“My logic is that we have to create something that works extremely well for the consumer and really optimise for our use case...

WhatsApp just warned of hacking campaign targeting users: Simple tips to tell if your phone has been hacked,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-just-warned-of-hacking-campaign-targeting-users-simple-tips-to-tell-if-your-phone-has-been-hacked/articleshow/123613818.cms,"WhatsApp recently announced that it has patched a software vulnerability that was being used by unknown hackers to target specific users of Apple products and hack them with spyware. In an advisory, WhatsApp said that a previously unknown bug “may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users.” WhatsApp fixed the bug while last week, Apple fixed another bug, known as CVE-2025-43300. Together, these vulnerabilities appear to have been the weak spots that allowed malicious spyware attacks targeting specific. The spyware aims to steal users' data.So, how do you know if your phone has been compromised? Often, a phone hack isn't announced with a flashing red light. Instead, it manifests through a series of subtle, yet concerning, changes in your phone's behavior. One of the first indicators of a potential hack is unusual phone behavior . This isn't always obvious, and sometimes it can be dismissed as a minor glitch. However, consistent and unexplained anomalies should raise a red flag. Understanding these indicators is the first step towards recognizing a potential breach.Unusual Battery Drain: One of the most common signs of a compromised phone is a rapidly draining battery. Malware or spyware running in the background constantly consumes power, even when you're not actively using your device. If your phone that once lasted all day now struggles to make it past lunch, it's worth investigating.Increased Data Usage: Similar to battery drain, unexpected spikes in data usage can point to a hack. Malicious software often communicates with external servers, sending out your data or receiving instructions. Check your phone's data usage statistics regularly. If you notice a significant increase without a corresponding change in your habits, be suspicious.Slow Performance and Frequent Crashes: A hacked phone can become noticeably sluggish. Apps might take longer to open, your phone could freeze frequently, or it might spontaneously restart. This is often due to the malicious software consuming your phone's processing power and memory.Strange Pop-ups and Ads: While some apps legitimately display ads, an abundance of unsolicited pop-up ads, especially when you're not even browsing the internet, can be a strong indicator of adware or spyware. These ads might also redirect you to suspicious websites.Unfamiliar Apps: Regularly review the apps installed on your phone. If you discover apps you don't recognize or remember installing, delete them immediately. Some sophisticated malware can even disguise itself as legitimate system applications.Overheating: A phone working overtime due to hidden processes can generate excessive heat, even when it's idle. If your phone feels unusually warm to the touch without heavy usage, it could be a warning sign.Unusual Messages or Calls: Be wary of text messages or calls from unknown numbers that seem out of place. Phishing attempts often start this way, trying to trick you into clicking malicious links or revealing personal information. If friends or family report receiving strange messages or calls from your number that you didn't send, your phone might be compromised.Changes to Settings You Didn't Make: If you notice changes to your phone's settings, such as your homepage being altered, new browser extensions appearing, or security settings being lowered, without your input, it's a red flag.","WhatsApp recently announced that a previously unknown bug “may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users” WhatsApp fixed the bug while Apple fixed another bug, known as CVE-2025-43300.

However, the host of the show responded with mockery and compared the features of the internet with the then available technologies.“You could listen to a baseball game on your computer,” Gates said. Letterman shot back, “Does radio ring a bell?” prompting laughter from the audience. Gates clarified that users could listen to games anytime, to which Letterman replied, “Do tape recorders ring a bell?”Along with this, Bill gates also talked about internet’s ability to connect people with niche interests also offer continuous updated information.

Huang’s comments come amid a wave of recent reports about the US administration’s interest in acquiring 15% share of H20 chips sales to China.“Well, first of all, I think TSMC is one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity, and anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person,” he said.Huang, who said his trip was primarily to thank TSMC for their work on Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin AI chip architecture , made the remarks in response to a direct query about the US government’s potential investment in the Taiwanese chip foundry, during his recent visit to Taiwan.The CEO also revealed that TSMC is working on six new products for Nvidia, including a new central processing unit (CPU) and a new graphics processing unit (GPU) that are crucial for advanced AI computation.Apart from resuming sales of H20 chips, Huang has also said that there’s a “real possibility” that Nvidia brings its advanced Blackwell processor to China.Reports have also said that the Trump administration is exploring the idea of taking equity stakes in companies like Micron, TSMC, and Samsung in exchange for CHIPS Act funding. This was followed by Lutnick confirming in a CNBC interview that the government was in talks to acquire a 10% stake in Intel.TSMC, for its part, announced a major expansion of its US investment in March, committing a total of $165 billion to build three advanced chip fabrication plants in Arizona.Separately, Huang addressed the ongoing controversy surrounding Nvidia's made-for-China H20 graphics processing units. News reports on Friday indicated that Nvidia had asked some of its suppliers, including Taiwan’s Foxconn, to pause production of the H20 chips after China raised new security concerns.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), calling anyone interested in taking a stake in the company “very smart” TSMC is the world’s largest chip manufacturer, and has Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm and Google as its partners.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123613231,imgsize-30156,width-400,resizemode-4/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang.jpg"

Citing sources familiar with the matter, a report by Business Insider , a team within MSL, internally known as TBD (to be determined), is focused on developing and making the Llama 4.X models production-ready for a targeted year-end release.The report says that the team is in a race against the clock, pushing to launch its next-generation Llama AI model , Llama 4.X, by the end of the year. This timeline is one of the first major projects to emerge from the company's newly formed team, which has already faced internal challenges and a wave of high-profile departures.The new model is also being referred to as Llama 4.5 by some employees, signifying a significant leap in development, the report added.As per the report, the urgency stems, in part, from the lukewarm reception of Meta's earlier Llama 4 models—Scout and Maverick—which were released in April. Some developers criticised the models for what they considered an underperformance in real-world tasks such as coding, reasoning, and following instructions.As a result, the TBD team is not only building Llama 4.X but is also working to fix bugs in the previous Llama 4 version.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July that the MSL will focus on the next generation of AI models, stating, “We're making good progress towards Llama 4.1 and 4.2, and in parallel, we're also working on our next generation of models that will push the frontier in the next year or so.”The creation of MSL in June was followed by a major hiring spree, with Meta reportedly offering multimillion-dollar compensation packages to attract top AI researchers from rivals like OpenAI Apple and Google DeepMind.However, this effort has been met with early setbacks.

Speaking to Liz Claman on Fox Business Network’s The Claman Countdown, Jensen Huang said that this shift could be another social shift, similar to what happened during previous industrial revolutions. Huang noted that work weeks have changed before, from seven to six days and then to a five-day schedule which is common now. “Every industrial revolution leads to some change in social behavior,” he said, adding that with AI and automation, “the economy will be doing very well.” Jensen Huang further predicted that GDP will grow and productivity will rise.However, that will not necessarily mean less work, he added. “I have to admit that I’m afraid to say that we are going to be busier in the future than now,” Huang said during the interview.","Jensen Huang once admitted that he doesn’t separate life from work, saying he thinks about the company even while watching movies.

Google cofounder Larry Page's career Advice: Embrace technology to be more lazy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-cofounder-larry-pages-career-advice-embrace-technology-to-be-more-lazy/articleshow/123611480.cms,"Finding leverage through smart work beats working harder, says Google co-founder



Technology creates opportunities for ambitious graduates



Google cofounder Larry Page delivered unconventional wisdom to University of Michigan graduates in 2009, telling them that ""technology, and especially the internet, can really help you be lazy."" The billionaire tech mogul, now worth $174 billion according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, encouraged students to seek leverage through technology rather than traditional hard work.Page's advice came during a commencement address where he reflected on Google's origins at Stanford University in the late 1990s. He credited his advisor's suggestion to ""work on the web for a while"" as pivotal to creating the search engine that would revolutionize information access. The timing proved fortuitous, as the internet was experiencing explosive growth and investment during that period.The Google cofounder illustrated his point with a practical example: ""A group of three people can write software that then millions can use and enjoy. Can three people answer the phone a million times?"" This philosophy of scalable impact guided Google's development from a Stanford research project into a $2.3 trillion technology giant that now dominates search, advertising, and artificial intelligence.Page's ""lazy"" approach has proven remarkably successful. Google went public in August 2004 at $85 per share with a $23 billion valuation. Today, parent company Alphabet ranks eighth on Fortune's 500 list and second globally among tech companies by revenue. The company's mission to ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"" exemplifies Page's leverage principle.Current Google CEO Sundar Pichai, recently named to the billionaires club with a $1.1 billion net worth, echoes similar themes about embracing discomfort and working with excellent people. However, the modern tech landscape presents different challenges, with some Google executives now advocating 60-hour workweeks during the AI development race.Despite industry pressures, Page's original message remains relevant for today's graduates facing uncertain job markets shaped by artificial intelligence. ""Don't give up on your dreams. The world needs you all,"" he concluded, encouraging ambitious young people to follow their curiosity while seeking technological leverage to amplify their impact.","Google cofounder Larry Page encouraged students to seek leverage through technology rather than traditional hard work.

AI 'Class Divide' and Productivity Dilemma

A new survey from WalkMe , an SAP company, reveals a striking paradox in the modern workplace: The employees who use AI the most—top executives and Gen Z workers—are also the least likely to receive official guidance, training, or company approval for their use. The findings from the 2025 AI in the Workplace survey suggest that a phenomenon dubbed "" AI shame "" is taking hold. The annual survey polled 1,000 working U.S. adults who use AI in their jobs to understand the reality of AI adoption.Nearly half of all workers surveyed (48.8%) admitted to hiding their use of AI on the job to avoid judgment. This discomfort is particularly pronounced at the top, with 53.4% of C-suite leaders confessing they conceal their AI habits, despite being the most frequent users.x`Almost half (45%) of workers admit to pretending to know how to use an AI tool in a meeting to avoid scrutiny, while 49% have hidden their use of AI to avoid judgment. This trend is even more pronounced among Gen Z, with 55.5% pretending to understand AI tools and 62% hiding their use.Gen Z workers show both enthusiasm and anxiety regarding AI. A notable 62.6% of Gen Zers have used AI to complete work but then pretended it was their own, the highest rate among any generation. Over half (55.4%) have feigned understanding of AI in meetings.Despite this widespread use—89.2% of Gen Z employees use AI at work -- they report receiving the least amount of support. Only 6.8% have received extensive, time-consuming AI training, and 13.5% received none at all. This lack of formal guidance has led 89.2% of them to use tools not provided or sanctioned by their employers.""Companies are not educating enough about this whole thing,"" said Sharon Bernstein, WalkMe's Chief Human Resources Officer, in an interview with Fortune. She noted that companies are failing to facilitate the use of AI tools or guide their employees effectively.The survey also points to an ""AI class divide,"" where access to training and guidance increases with rank. Only 3.7% of entry-level employees receive substantial training, compared to 17.1% of C-level executives. This leaves the most frequent users, junior and younger staff, to navigate the new technology on their own, risking a growing knowledge gap.While 80% of employees believe AI has boosted their productivity, a significant number are struggling. Almost 60% confessed to spending more time trying to manage AI tools than it would have taken to do the work themselves.Gen Z is particularly affected by this paradox:* 65.3% say AI slows them down, the highest among all age groups.* 68% feel pressure to produce more work because of it.* Nearly one in three are deeply anxious about AI's impact on their jobs.This disconnect between corporate hype and on-the-ground reality fits into a broader picture of chaotic AI implementation. For instance, a recent MIT study found a staggering 95% failure rate for generative AI pilot programs at large enterprises, suggesting a significant gap between the theory of AI and its practical application.","A new survey from WalkMe reveals a striking paradox in the modern workplace.

In a recent interview with Fortune, Julie Sweet opened up about her dual battles with cancer and how the experiences shaped her approach to both business and life. Sweet, who leads a global workforce of 770,000, is among global top CEOs, but her journey to the top was anything but traditional. During a discussion on the new Fortune vodcast, ""Fortune 500: Titans and Disrupters of Industry,"" Sweet shared a personal story of professional triumph and personal struggle.

Just one month later, however, her life was put into sharp perspective when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. As a mother of young children, the diagnosis prompted her to reflect on her life's choices. ""I asked myself if I had any regrets and I actually felt like I struck the right balance,"" she said.

Tesla says opposing lawyers misled court on Elon Musk

Tesla is challenging a $243 million court verdict, arguing that the opposing lawyers misled the jury by focusing on CEO Elon Musk . The company filed a motion in a Miami federal court, seeking to either overturn the verdict, secure a new trial, or significantly reduce the damages awarded. The case involves a fatal 2019 crash where a 22-year-old student, Naibel Benavides, was killed. The victim's family and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, were awarded compensatory and punitive damages. Although the jury found the driver of the Tesla to be mostly at fault, it also assigned significant blame to Tesla's Autopilot technology.“If the verdict is allowed to stand, it will chill innovation, harm road safety and invite future juries to punish manufacturers who bring new safety features to market,” the company said in the filing.This trial has been closely monitored by the carmakers across the world as companies race to develop self-driving features. Carmakers fear that the verdict could set a precedent, holding them liable for accidents even when drivers are acting recklessly. In its filing, Tesla stated that if the verdict stands, it could ""chill innovation, harm road safety, and invite future juries to punish manufacturers who bring new safety features to market.""Tesla claims that the opposing lawyers ""led the jury astray"" with ""highly prejudicial but irrelevant evidence."" This included suggesting that Tesla had intentionally hidden or lost video and data related to the crash. Although Tesla admitted to a mistake in not providing the evidence sooner, it maintains the omission was not deliberate.The company also argued that its technology had no role in the crash. In contrast, the plaintiffs' lawyers contended that Tesla's use of the term ""Autopilot"" was intentionally misleading, as the system only provides driver assistance and is not fully autonomous. They noted that other automakers use less ambiguous terms like ""driver assist"" or ""copilot.""The lawsuit went to trial after Tesla refused a $60 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs. The final jury award was more than four times that amount. The driver of the Tesla had previously settled with the victims' families in a separate agreement.","Tesla says opposing lawyers misled court on Elon Musk.

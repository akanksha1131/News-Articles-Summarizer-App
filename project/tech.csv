"TikTok returns to Apple and Google App Stores, following Donald Trump's ban delay",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-returns-to-apple-and-google-app-stores-following-donald-trumps-ban-delay/articleshow/118231295.cms,"TikTok has made a comeback on the Apple and Google app stores in the United States after President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a ban on the popular short-video app . The ban, initially set to take effect on January 19, 2025, was postponed by 75 days through an executive order signed by Trump, allowing the app to continue its operations temporarily.The decision to delay the ban came after concerns were raised about the app's Chinese ownership and potential national security risks. The law, passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden, required TikTok's parent company, ByteDance , to sell its US operations or face a nationwide ban. However, Trump's executive order has provided a temporary reprieve, giving his administration time to determine the appropriate course of action.TikTok, which boasts 170 million American users, had gone dark in the US for several weeks before the app was restored on the app stores. The delay in the ban has allowed Apple and Google to reinstate TikTok without facing penalties for distributing or maintaining the app.The move has sparked discussions about the future of TikTok in the US and the broader implications of regulating foreign-owned apps. While the delay provides temporary relief, the app's long-term fate remains uncertain as the administration continues to negotiate a resolution that addresses national security concerns.","The ban, initially set to take effect on January 19, 2025, was postponed by 75 days through an executive order signed by Trump.

"SEBI appeals to government: Need power to access WhatsApp and Telegram chats, messages, call records",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sebi-appeals-to-government-need-power-to-access-whatsapp-and-telegram-chats-messages-call-records/articleshow/118225168.cms,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is reportedly seeking expanded authority to combat unauthorized financial advice on social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram. According to a report by news agency Reuters, SEBI is seeking broader powers from the government to remove unauthorised financial advice from social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram , and to access their call records for investigations into market violations.This marks SEBI's second request since the year 2022 for such powers, with government approval still pending. In a letter dated February 3, SEBI highlighted that platforms like WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms, have denied the regulator access to group chats, citing current information technology laws that do not recognize SEBI as an 'authorized agency.' The regulator is requesting the ability to remove messages, information, links, and groups that violate securities regulations, as well as access to call and message data records from digital platforms.Currently, such powers are granted to other law enforcement agencies, including the Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate , but not to regulators like SEBI. The government is reviewing SEBI's request, noting that such authority is typically reserved for serious crimes and would require a broader policy decision for all regulators.This move comes amid SEBI's intensified efforts to investigate market violations and curb unregulated financial advice circulating on social media. Platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram have become popular among market participants, with financial influencers sharing trading tips on specific stocks and securities in exchange for money.In August 2022, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch made a similar request for more powers to access information exchanges among suspects involved in offenses such as insider trading through digital resources. The government did not grant those powers but ... with representatives from Meta Platforms to direct them to provide relevant information for ongoing investigations.Developed countries like those in Europe and the US reportedly do not grant their securities regulators direct authority to take down social media posts. However, regulators in these nations can impose penalties on individuals involved in illegal activities, such as fraud or misleading advertising.","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is reportedly seeking expanded authority to combat unauthorized financial advice on social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram.

Sebastian Thrun , founder of Google X (Google's research arm), emphasised the need for responsible AI regulation , assuring that the technology will complement rather than replace human workers. Speaking during a session titled ""Pioneering AI: From Imagination to Real-World Impact"" at the Global Investors' Meet, Thrun discussed the evolving role of AI and its impact on regulation and job markets. Thrun addressed the issue of AI regulation, acknowledging its importance but cautioning against overregulation that could stifle innovation.He stressed the importance of regulation while cautioning against excessive restrictions that could stifle innovation. ""Regulation is necessary, but it must not hinder research,"" he stated, emphasizing the need to avoid preemptive control of developing technologies. He suggested intervention should be reserved for demonstrated misuse.Thrun noted that while China and the EU are already regulating AI, India has yet to implement formal measures. He praised India's tech-savvy CEOs and dynamic tech ecosystem. ""Indian CEOs are incredibly tech-savvy and visionary, which is why they have been able to lead global companies like Google,"" Thrun saidAddressing job market concerns, Thrun acknowledged potential job displacement but predicted AI will ultimately create more opportunities than it eliminates. He estimated that while roughly 60% of current jobs may disappear, even more new jobs will emerge, urging young people to prepare for these new roles. He believes AI will shift job types, requiring adaptation for new careers in emerging fields. ""Approximately 60 per cent of current jobs may disappear, but far more new jobs will emerge as a result of AI and other technologies. Young people must prepare themselves for these new roles,"" he said.Thrun encouraged the younger generation to pursue AI-related skills like coding, data science, cybersecurity, and digital marketing. He envisions AI revolutionizing transportation, healthcare, and personalized services.He further speculated that AI might one day allow future generations to interact with loved ones even after their passing, highlighting its potential to enable communication and virtual participation in significant life events.","Sebastian Thrun, founder of Google X, spoke at the Global Investors' Meet.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Thursday (February 13) and engaged in wide-ranging discussions on space exploration, technology, and governance reforms.

While the US export restrictions have limited access to advanced AI training chips, DeepSeek's models focus on ""inference"" tasks, optimizing computational efficiency rather than relying solely on raw processing power. This approach enables Chinese-made AI processors to partially close the performance gap with their more powerful U.S. counterparts.Huawei, along with other Chinese AI chipmakers such as Hygon, Tencent-backed EnFlame, Tsingmicro, and Moore Threads, have recently announced support for DeepSeek models, though specific details remain limited. Industry analysts suggest that DeepSeek's open-source nature and low fees could accelerate AI adoption and the development of real-world applications, assisting Chinese firms in navigating U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI chips.Despite these advancements, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market, particularly in AI training tasks. Analysts note that while Chinese AI chips are cost-competitive for inference tasks within China, Nvidia's chips still outperform in these areas. Additionally, Nvidia's CUDA platform remains a significant component of its market leadership, posing challenges for Chinese companies like Huawei, which are developing alternatives such as the Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN).Nvidia recently published a blog post about how inference time was rising as a new scaling law and argued that its chips will be necessary to make DeepSeek and other ""reasoning"" models more useful.

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Why Google made changes to Google Calendar

Read the company’s full response

We’ve received some questions about the holidays and moments that are displayed in Google Calendar. We want to clarify that we made this change last year, globally.

Some years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of moments in a wide number of countries around the world — things like cultural celebrations, teachers days and many more. We got feedback that many other events and countries were missing, and it just wasn’t feasible to put hundreds of moments in everyone’s calendars — so in mid-2024 we made the decision to simplify and show only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com. Contrary to some of the comments on social media, this was not something we did just this year.

Some important things to note:

Showing public holidays and national observances, rather than a broader set of moments, is consistent with other major online calendar providers. Google Calendar is also customizable, so users can more easily add important moments to their calendar.

As a company, we continue to celebrate and promote a variety of cultural moments across our products, visible to people everywhere — as you saw in the last few weeks with Black History Month and Lunar New Year.","Google responded to questions about the holidays and moments that are displayed in Google Calendar.

US President Donald Trump has nominated an Apple employee to lead the country’s major auto safety regulator. According to Senate records (seen by the news agency Reuters), John Morrison who has also served as the former chief counsel of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) will lead the agency as its administrator.Morrison, who previously worked for the California New Car Dealers Association, joined Apple in 2021 for its car project, which was later shut down. The Apple Car project, which is thought to have started in 2014, was internally referred to as Project Titan and aimed to develop a fully autonomous vehicle. As per his LinkedIn profile, he also served as the Chief Counsel at NHTSA during Trump’s first term and is currently associated with Apple.If confirmed as head of NHTSA, Morrison would oversee several ongoing safety investigations into Elon Musk’s Tesla. Last month, US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed the continuation of a government probe into Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, has been advocating for a significant reduction in the size of the federal government and has previously criticized various NHTSA actions.Just two weeks before Trump took office, NHTSA launched an investigation into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles following reports of crashes involving a feature that allows users to remotely move their cars.In October 2024, NHTSA began an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after four reported collisions, including a fatal crash in 2023.NHTSA also opened a preliminary evaluation into Tesla's ""Actually Smart Summon"" feature after reports of four crashes involving Tesla vehicles.In December 2023, Tesla recalled over two million vehicles in the US to implement new safeguards in its Autopilot system. NHTSA is also still probing whether this recall sufficiently addressed concerns that drivers are not paying adequate attention.In October 2018, Morrison, the then-chief counsel at NHTSA, sent Tesla a letter accusing the company of making inaccurate safety claims that violated the agency’s guidelines.","US President Donald Trump has nominated an Apple employee to lead the country’s major auto safety regulator.

What is the price of JioCoin?

Mukesh Ambani’s vision for Jio Coin and blockchain technology



Earning JioCoins with JioSphere browser activities



JioCoins: Potential redemption options



Impact of Jio and Polygon collaboration on India’s blockchain landscape

Also Read |

Jio Coin, a digital token recently unveiled by Reliance Jio , remains somewhat enigmatic. While opinions on its nature undoubtedly abound, any proclamation at this juncture, be it attached to the expectations of a cryptocurrency-the likes of Bitcoin-or other untried instruments-presently stands uncorroborated within the business-world credit manual. Rather more in the realm of loyalty reward systems, the company has yet to divulge anything about how Jio itself will operate in its ecosystem or even whether it takes any fit to incorporate existing blockchain technologies. This whole endeavor of Jio has generated much interest, leading to curiosity and some anticipation amongst many about Jio Coin's forthcoming prospects.Designed by Reliance Jio, JioCoin generated a lot of buzz but does not resemble the classic definition of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. JioCoin is being billed as a form of digital currency and seems to be more about some kind of a digital reward or points system than being a well decentralized, blockchain-powered currency concerned. So, JioCoin may well have an incentive-slanted approach and an internal ecosystem currency function, rather than functioning like a decentralized currency similar to bitcoin.As of now, Jio Coin's official price has not been announced, but business analysts estimate that it might start at a token price of approximately $0.50 (Rs 43.30). One of the most important determinants of JioCoin value will be how well it integrates within Reliance Jio's larger ecosystem, such as popular services like JioMart, Reliance petrol stations, and more, among others. Mukesh Ambani said that JioCoin is an attempt to push blockchain-based technology to a wider audience. With nearly 450 million users, the Jio presence could make this digital currency a leading player within India, expectedly aiding the increased adoption of Web3 technology in the country.JioCoin probably followed with the entry of several Indians into blockchain and decentralization technologies, improving ease of access to Web3- potential mainstreaming.JioCoins are digital tokens that reside on the Polygon blockchain. Users earn them when they use various apps mobile and internet-based, enabled through Jio's JioSphere browser. Users will earn JioCoins simply by signing in with their numbers and surfing Jio's ecosystem. They will be credited to their Polygon wallet because such activity takes place.This rewards system encourages Jio users to be active in the Jio ecosystem, getting Web3 tokens simply through use of the JioSphere browser. On the other hand, rather unclear seem to be the ways of redeeming or using these tokens for its users. It would be interesting to see different things Reliance Jio is going to explore in future uses for JioCoins, such as redemption for reward through discounts, purchases, further linking to other services within the Jio ecosystem.There are many theories as to how Reliance Jio might allow users to redeem their JioCoins. Some people believe that tokens function as an internal currency for all his services, which will integrate those brands into a coherent rewards system. Others believe that Jio may take a more conventional route and set up a JioCoin for real things, discounts, or services.If JioCoin catches ground and has a larger user base to add, then potentially the JioSphere browser could otherwise compete to be one of the better-known browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as it attracts users into earning digital tokens through their actions online.Jio and Polygon together make a loud and clear noise to enhance the credibility of Polygon as a blockchain network in India. Because Jio has numerous users all over India, this collaboration has enormous potential to bring in millions into using the Polygon network, which will further increase consumer interest in blockchain technology.It could also make other consumer giants like Airtel or Vodafone Idea in future consider integrating with Polygon or other blockchain networks. This deal is a significant milestone security-wise for Polygon, as it opens up valuable opportunities tapping into Jio's consumer base, which is supposed to lead to real widespread adoption of blockchain technology.","Reliance Jio unveiled Jio Coin, a digital token recently unveiled by the company.

However, the e-commerce giant is actively partnering with brands in the beauty, home, and kitchen categories as part of its scale-up plan.""We are in talks to onboard with them (Amazon) and should be live by March-April after they stabilise grocery and daily essentials. Beauty and home are the next focus areas,"" a senior executive told Economic Times.Amazon's entry into the ultrafast delivery space comes at a time when the quick commerce sector in India is experiencing rapid growth. The market, valued at $6 billion in 2024, is projected to reach $40 billion by 2030. Major players like Blinkit , Swiggy Instamart , Zepto, Flipkart Minutes, and BigBasket are already competing fiercely to capture market share.E-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart are vying for a share of the market as Swiggy Instamart contends with heightened competition from Zomato-owned Blinkit and Zepto while defending its No.2 position in the quick commerce sector.Despite Swiggy doubling its dark store footprint in 2024, Citi Research observed that the company has been “slow to acknowledge the large opportunity” and is now “playing catch-up.” In contrast, Blinkit has more than doubled its dark store network over the past year, further solidifying its lead.As Amazon rolls out its pilot program, the battle for dominance in India's quick commerce market is set to intensify.","Amazon has officially entered the quick commerce market in India with the launch of its 10-minute delivery service, Amazon Now.

He also emphasized the need for India to attract better talent and financial resources to bridge the gap with the U.S. in financial services.","Zerodha was founded in 2010 by Nithin and Nikhil Kamath.

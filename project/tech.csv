The conversation surrounding long working hours reignited recently following remarks by Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan, suggesting employees should work up to 90 hours a week, even on Sundays. This controversial statement sparked widespread debate, drawing responses from other prominent corporate leaders. Former HCL CEO Vineet Nayar , Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra , and industrialist Gautam Adani weighed in with diverse perspectives that challenge the glorification of excessive working hours. Their viewpoints underline the importance of work-life balance , personal fulfillment, and productivity.Former HCL CEO Vineet Nayar took a contrasting stance, emphasizing the importance of living a fulfilling life rather than measuring productivity in hours worked. In a LinkedIn post, Nayar questioned the glorification of relentless work schedules and criticized the culture of constant connectivity.He shared a personal anecdote with a picture of a street-side professional giving him a head massage, saying, “Today, I didn’t just get a head massage. I took back a moment of my life.” Nayar argued that moments of relaxation and reflection are essential to maintaining energy, creativity, and purpose.He proposed a balanced approach: “Work more if you want. Work less if you can. The number doesn’t matter. What matters is whether you’re making space for moments that make life worth living.”L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan ignited controversy by advocating for 90-hour workweeks and even suggested employees should work on Sundays. He remarked on the supposed futility of excessive time spent at home, famously asking, “How long can you stare at your wife?” While his comments were intended to highlight the importance of dedication to nation-building, they sparked backlash across social media, with many criticising the unrealistic and unhealthy expectations such a schedule entails.Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra echoed similar sentiments, advocating for prioritising the quality of work over the quantity of hours spent. He emphasised that impactful decisions and meaningful contributions are not dependent on excessive hours but rather on well-rounded decision-making informed by a balanced life.Mahindra stated, “It’s not about 40 hours, 70 hours, or 90 hours. What matters is the output and impact. Even 10 hours can change the world if they’re productive.” He also stressed the importance of spending time with family, friends, and personal reflection, asserting that such experiences enrich professional decision-making.Industrialist Gautam Adani took a more individualistic approach, asserting that work-life balance should be a personal choice. He noted that different individuals derive fulfillment from varying levels of engagement with family or work. “If someone spends four hours with their family and feels content, or another spends eight hours and enjoys it, that’s their balance,” Adani explained.However, his humorous remark—“Aath ghanta family ke saath bitayega tho biwi bhaag jaayegi (If you spend eight hours with your family, your wife might leave)”—drew criticism online. Many accused him of trivializing the importance of family time and promoting toxic work cultures.The responses from Nayar, Mahindra, and Adani collectively reflect a shift in workplace values. Leaders are increasingly advocating for a nuanced, personalized approach to balancing professional and personal life. Their perspectives underline the importance of focusing on fulfillment, mental well-being , and quality productivity over sheer effort.While Subrahmanyan’s remarks sparked controversy, they also reignited critical discussions about workplace cultures, encouraging leaders and employees alike to reevaluate their priorities. As the global workforce navigates challenges in productivity, health, and satisfaction, the debate underscores the need to balance professional ambition with personal fulfillment.","The conversation surrounding long working hours reignited recently following remarks by Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan, suggesting employees should work up to 90 hours a week.

The open letter from IFCN to Mark Zuckerberg

Challenges of crowdsourced moderation



Meta’s dominance and business implications

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, has long partnered with professional fact-checking organizations to combat misinformation on its platforms. However, a recent decision to replace third-party fact-checkers with a crowdsourced moderation model in the United States has drawn criticism from experts and stakeholders. As per reports, the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), a prominent group under the Poynter Institute, has led the charge against this move, emphasising its potential impact on the quality and reliability of information shared online. With 71 organizations already signing an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg , the debate underscores the global stakes of Meta’s policy changes.Meta announced its decision to phase out third-party fact-checking partnerships in the U.S. and transition to a crowdsourced moderation system. This model, similar to the ""community notes"" employed by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter), allows users to provide input on the validity of posts. Meta framed the move as part of a broader initiative to promote transparency and community involvement in content moderation.Despite its ambitious scope, the policy shift has been met with skepticism. Critics argue that while crowdsourced systems may democratize moderation, they lack the rigor and expertise of professional fact-checkers.The IFCN penned an open letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, expressing deep concern over the abandonment of third-party fact-checking in favor of crowdsourced models, as reported by Business Insider. Signed by 71 organizations globally, the letter highlighted the critical role professional fact-checkers play in combating misinformation and fostering evidence-based discussions.“Fact-checking is essential to maintaining shared realities and evidence-based discussion, both in the United States and globally,” the letter emphasised.The IFCN warned that Meta's decision is a step backward, jeopardizing accurate and trustworthy information on platforms used by billions daily.Meta’s fact-checking partnerships span over 100 countries, providing crucial support for combating misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. According to reports, the IFCN raised concerns about the potential global implications if Meta extends this policy worldwide.“If Meta decides to stop the program globally, it is almost certain to result in real-world harm in many places,” the IFCN wrote. The organization highlighted the financial and operational vulnerabilities of smaller fact-checking groups that rely on Meta's funding to sustain their work.The proposed crowdsourced system has drawn comparisons to the community notes feature on X, which allows users to add context to posts. While this model has its merits, it has also faced criticism for being slow to address misinformation and lacking the expertise required to debunk complex claims.The IFCN proposed a hybrid approach, combining the strengths of professional fact-checking with community input. “The need for this is great: If people believe social media platforms are full of scams and hoaxes, they won’t want to spend time there or do business on them,” the letter stated.Meta’s platforms serve more than 3.3 billion users daily, accounting for over 40% of the global population. Despite the controversy surrounding the policy change, advertising insiders believe it is unlikely to affect Meta’s revenue significantly. With over a fifth of the U.S. digital ad market, Meta’s dominance remains largely unchallenged, according to EMARKETER data."," Meta announced its decision to phase out third-party fact-checking partnerships in the U.S. and transition to a crowdsourced moderation system.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently underwent a significant neck surgery, an experience he described as both painful and necessary. Known for his active presence on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk’s recent inactivity left his followers curious about his absence. On January 12, 2025, Musk responded to a fan’s query, revealing that he was recovering from a complex neck operation. This disclosure provided insight into the health challenges he has been managing for years and the factors that led to this crucial procedure.Musk traced the genesis of his neck issues to an old sumo wrestling match. During this incident, he managed to throw his opponent but severely strained his neck in the process. Over time, the strain evolved into a chronic condition, resulting in damage to the C5-C6 disc in his spine. Musk explained that this damage necessitated five surgeries over the years, with the most recent one addressing nerve inflammation and a narrowed spinal orifice. Despite these challenges, Musk has remained optimistic and candid, sharing details of his journey to recovery with his followers.Musk’s revelation sparked an outpouring of support from fans and followers on X. Numerous well-wishers sent messages of encouragement, hoping for his swift recovery, while some shared remedies and tips for managing pain and inflammation.One admirer commented, ""Wishing you a speedy recovery! The universe needs you!"" Another expressed sympathy, saying, ""Get well soon, man. That sounds rough."" A third added, ""Take care, Elon. Hope you’re feeling better soon."" Another user asked, ""Is this related to the sumo match injury? Wishing you a full recovery and thinking of you.""One follower offered advice, suggesting, “Turmeric works wonders for inflammation—try sprinkling it on your meals. Chiropractic adjustments can also relieve pressure on the nerves and ease discomfort. Additionally, consider using frankincense oil topically; it’s known for its pain-relieving properties. Hope this helps!”","Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently underwent a significant neck surgery. Musk traced the genesis of his neck issues to an old sumo wrestling match.

Meta ends DEI programs, shifting to merit-based hiring amid employee concerns

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , Instagram, and Threads, has recently undertaken a series of sweeping changes to its policies and operations. These adjustments, which include decisions affecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, content moderation practices, and facilities management, have sparked widespread discussion. According to reports from Fox News Digital and The New York Times, these changes appear to reflect Meta’s evolving stance on workplace policies and platform governance, prompting a mix of support, criticism, and employee dissatisfaction.One of the most visible policy shifts was the removal of tampons from men’s restrooms across Meta’s offices in Silicon Valley, Texas, and New York. This decision, reported by The New York Times, impacts nonbinary and transgender employees who may require such amenities. The company has not provided detailed explanations for this change, leaving room for speculation and concern among affected staff and advocates.Meta has also revamped its approach to content moderation. In a move toward ""restoring free expression,"" the company ended its third-party fact-checking program in the United States. The program, which had been central to Meta’s efforts to combat misinformation, is being replaced by a ""community notes"" system similar to the model used by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter). This crowdsourced moderation framework is intended to allow users to collaboratively add context to potentially misleading posts.Critics argue that the elimination of fact-checking may leave the platform vulnerable to the unchecked spread of misinformation. However, Meta contends that the previous system had ""gone too far"" and impeded open discourse.Meta has discontinued its primary DEI initiatives , a decision that Joel Kaplan, Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, defended as a step toward merit-based hiring. Kaplan stated that recruitment would focus on individual qualifications rather than considerations of race or gender. While Meta frames this shift as a move to promote fairness and broaden candidate pools, internal communications reveal that LGBTQ staff members and other employees have expressed dissatisfaction, with some announcing their departure from the company.The broader implications of this policy change extend beyond recruitment. Critics worry that the absence of structured DEI programs could lead to reduced support for underrepresented groups within Meta’s workforce.Another notable change involves the removal of transgender and nonbinary customization options from the Messenger application. This move has fueled concerns about Meta's commitment to inclusivity. Internal reports indicate that LGBTQ+ employees feel alienated by these decisions, and many have raised questions about the company’s long-term priorities regarding diversity and inclusion.These policy changes come amid what many observers see as a broader alignment with the political climate in the United States, particularly with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Critics suggest that Meta’s decisions may reflect a strategic effort to gain favor with the administration by adopting positions that align with its ideological leanings. This perception is further reinforced by the company’s public emphasis on restoring ""free expression"" and its distancing from progressive DEI initiatives.Internally, the response from Meta employees has been mixed. While some staff members view the changes as necessary to streamline operations and foster innovation, others feel disillusioned by what they see as a retreat from Meta’s prior commitments to inclusivity and progressive values.Externally, Meta’s actions have drawn significant criticism from advocacy groups, public figures, and industry analysts. Some argue that these changes undermine the progress made in fostering a more equitable workplace and responsible content moderation practices.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, has made a series of changes to its policies and operations.

“I find that interference dangerous,” Meloni continued. ""But when that happens, we refer to them as philanthropists: is the issue that Musk is rich and influential, or that he’s not left-wing?""

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni recently announced that her government is in talks with several private companies, including Elon Musk 's SpaceX , about the country's telecom security system. However, she firmly denied holding any private discussions with Musk on the subject.""I've never discussed this with Musk.

Meloni defended Musk’s right to express his political views, arguing that he does not pose a threat to democracy. “The issue arises when individuals use resources to fund parties and groups worldwide to influence policies, which I don’t see Musk doing, unlike George Soros,” she said.Musk, a close ally of US President-elect Donald Trump , has expressed enthusiasm for partnering with Italy, offering through X (formerly Twitter) that SpaceX is ""ready to provide Italy the most secure and advanced connectivity.""Starlink has been operating in Italy since 2021 and could potentially expand its services to include emergency response during disasters or terrorist attacks. Musk’s company is also developing Starshield, a project for defense and sensitive operations.The reported deal, worth 1.5 billion Euros (approximately 1.6 billion USD) over five years, has raised concerns among opposition parties, who question whether a company led by Musk should handle such sensitive communications.","Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni recently announced that her government is in talks with several private companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

iPhone SE 4: Apple may launch iPhone SE 4 and iPad 11 by April this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-launch-iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april-this-year/articleshow/117042093.cms,"Representative Image



iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

Take a look at her post



“Choices, Hard Work and Happiness

I debated whether to write this post, because the risk of being misquoted on this issue in this clickbait world is high. But I am trying to share what is a nuanced point of view on the issue of work-life balance.

1. Hard work is important and I was taught and believe that it is the only way to rise. In the competitive workplace, I also believe the person who works harder will rise faster. Great careers, achievements, and companies are the results of a lot of hard work.

2. Hard work is a choice. Ambition is a choice. And choices have consequences. Not everybody has to aspire to be a CEO or founder with a mega exit. I know many people who have chosen the path of a less demanding career within their field because time off from work matters to them. No judgments.

3. Now let's talk hours. I worked 100 hours a week for four consecutive months on my 1st project during my 1st job.18 hours a day, with one day off (and not Sunday—I got Monday off because I had to be at a client site on Sunday).

What was it like? 90% of the time, I was miserable. I went to office bathrooms and cried, ate chocolate cake from room service at 2 a.m., and was hospitalized twice. Most importantly, I may have been at work for 100 hours, but I was not productive in those. The same story is true for many of my graduating classmates who joined similar roles in banking, consulting, etc.

Hard work is not equal to hours worked. Many of those hours in entry-level careers were pure facetime. Heck, I know a friend who created a screensaver with an Excel model to convince their boss they were in the office! No wonder many of us didn't last in those roles very long. Hard work needs to be sustainable for us to be able to do it for a long period of time, which is when compounding kicks in.

4. Hours is not equal to

productivity

. Many developed nations work 8–4 but ensure those hours are productive. Come in on time, bring your best to work, have only necessary meetings, and use technology to be effective. Recently, I was telling my investment team, “Let’s find a way to use AI to make research more efficient—our talent cannot spend hours on grunt work.”

5. Family and mental health cannot be absent from this. Otherwise, we will build a world of anxiety and breakdowns, early heart attacks, unhappy marriages, and absentee parenting. I could work those hours I did as a young, single girl because I had no responsibilities. Today, between my career, managing my home, caring for parents, and giving time to my husband and son, I am consumed. And this is despite privilege: a hands-on husband, support staff, parents who chip in, and lots of resources. I commute 1.5 hours a day, but many commute 3–4 hours in our cities. They have homes to run, chores to do, dabbas to pack, kids to drop to school and more.

6. As organizations, we have to think about the culture we create. Of course, founders/CEOs work harder—they have economic incentives to do so. But I have found in our own org that when you create a culture where people find purpose in what they do, they will go above and beyond for you, even in difficult personal circumstances. Forcing anything is hard, let alone enforcing a certain number of hours. Inspiring people to give their best is easier.

7. All of us have to contribute to making India a developed nation. But as we do so, we should also strive to be a happy nation—enjoying the fruits of that development: the joy of building, of giving our families better lives, and of experiencing what the previous generation may not have had. Happiness, inclusive growth, and development go hand in hand.

Finally, I meet many young people, especially women, who are questioning whether they should have a family because of the fear that family and career cannot coexist. This debate scares them even more. Having a happy relationship with work and life is possible while contributing to the dream of Viksit Bharat. Let’s tell our kids that.”

Radhika Gupta , MD & CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund , has shared her views on work-life balance . Gupta has shared a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to join the ongoing debate sparked by L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan's controversial remarks on work-life balance. Earlier, Subrahmanyan suggested employees work 90-hour weeks and his comments on ""staring at your wife"" drew criticism from figures like Deepika Padukone while billionaire Anand Mahindra emphasised prioritising quality of work. In her X post, Gupta acknowledged the complexities of the debate and highlighted the importance of hard work for achieving success but also emphasised that it's a personal choice tied to individual ambitions.In her elaborate X post, Gupta wrote:",Radhika Gupta has shared her views on work-life balance on social media.

Other tech leaders that may attend Trump’s inauguration

Several prominent tech leaders have already met President-elect Donald Trump and now a number of them are set to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration this month, a report has said. This may signal the industry's efforts to strengthen ties with Trump as he returns to the White House.According to a report by Bloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg , the CEO of Facebook-parent company Meta , intends to be present, as confirmed by a source familiar with the matter. Zuckerberg has reportedly met with Trump two times ahead of him assuming office as the President of the US. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also plans to attend the swearing-in ceremony on January 20, according to a company spokesperson. Previous reports have said that Altman is finding it difficult to meet the President-elect because of Elon Musk , who is purportedly stationed as a gatekeeper. Anyone who wants to meet Trump has to go through Musk, reports claimed. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will participate in some of the surrounding festivities, according to the company. Uber also plans to co-host an inauguration party in Washington with Elon Musk’s X social media firm and The Free Press, a media company, Bloomberg said.In addition to Altman, OpenAI president Greg Brockman and chief product officer Kevin Weil also plan to attend the inauguration, as told by a company spokesperson to the publication. Musk is also likely to attend, given his close relationship with Trump.Various tech leaders, such as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have reportedly met with Trump after his win in the US Presidential elections.Meta and Amazon have pledged to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, meanwhile, Altman has personally donated $1 million to the fund.","Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook-parent company Meta, intends to be present, as confirmed by a source familiar with the matter.

What Musk said about Neuralink's third human implant



“We’ve got now three humans with Neuralinks implanted and they’re working well. We upgraded the devices, they’ll have more electrodes, basically higher bandwidth, longer battery life and everything. So, expect 20 or 30 patients this year with the upgraded Neuralink devices.""

What Musk said about Neuralink’s roadmap



“With our first product, we’re trying to enable people who have lost their brain-body connection. So, if they are tetraplegic, paraplegic or, as you can imagine say Stephen Hawking. If

could communicate as fast or even faster than a normal human, that would be transformational. Being able to read the motor cortex of the brain. If you think about moving your hand, it will move the cursor on the screen. And it enables people to control their computer or their phone just by thinking. Then our next part will be

Blindsight devices

where even if somebody has lost both eyes or has lost the optic nerve, we can interface directly with the visual cortex in the brain and enable them to see. We already have that working in monkeys,”

“We think if you have a second Neuralink device, that is past the point where the spinal damage occurred. We can transmit the signals from the brain past where essentially the wires are broken and enable someone to walk again. I'm confident that that is physically possible. In the long term goal for Neuralink is to be able to improve the bandwidth. So, right now, when we're speaking our bandwidth and this per second is quite low and the sustained bandwidth of a human is less than one bit per second over 24 hours,”","Musk: ""We’ve got now three humans with Neuralinks implanted and they’re working well"" ""We think if you have a second Neuralink device, that is past the point where the spinal damage occurred,"" he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117156121,imgsize-707642,width-400,resizemode-4/117156121.jpg"

Represented by Noel Francisco, TikTok argued the law violates First Amendment free speech. Defending the law, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar emphasized the urgency of national security concerns with a January 19 deadline.

Upset Tiktok content creators

TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance reportedly offered a warning during Supreme Court arguments over a law that would compel the sale of the short-video app or ban it in the United States. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the lawyer representing TikTok warned of broader implications for other companies. Noel Francisco, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that: ""If Congress could do this to TikTok, it could come after other companies, too.""The law, debated by the justices, sets a January 19 deadline for ByteDance to sell the platform or face a ban due to national security concerns. The companies argue that the law violates First Amendment free speech protections and seek at least a delay. Francisco argued that upholding this law could justify similar actions against other companies. He cited the example of AMC theaters, previously Chinese-owned, suggesting Congress could use this precedent to censor or promote specific films.While some justices expressed First Amendment concerns, their questions suggested an inclination to uphold the law. TikTok boasts roughly 170 million U.S. users. Congress passed the measure with bipartisan support in 2024, citing fears of Chinese government espionage and influence operations.Jeffrey Fisher, representing TikTok content creators, reportedly questioned why the law targeted only TikTok and not other Chinese online retailers like Temu, which has 70 million U.S. users. He questioned the logic of singling out TikTok while ignoring other platforms potentially subject to Chinese control.As per the Reuters report, solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, defending the law for the Biden administration, emphasized the urgency of the January 19 deadline to force ByteDance's action. She argued that ""foreign adversaries"" wouldn't willingly relinquish control over a major U.S. communication channel and that the deadline might be the necessary ""jolt"" for divestiture.A January 19 ban would prevent new TikTok downloads on Apple and Google platforms, though existing users could initially still access the app. However, the app's functionality would degrade over time without ongoing support.The Court also debated whether potential Chinese propaganda or influence campaigns justified the ban. Francisco countered that content manipulation is widespread, citing various U.S. news outlets.There was mention of the possibility of a change in administration affecting the law's enforcement, with the suggestion that a new administration might pursue a different approach. A justice questioned whether the president could simply choose not to enforce the law, to which the Solicitor General acknowledged presidential enforcement discretion. The argument was made that a preliminary injunction could provide ""breathing space.""","TikTok warned that a law forcing its sale or ban in the U.S. could set a precedent impacting other companies.

What Assam police said about the incident



“It was a tea garden area, which was shown in Assam on Google Maps. However, it was actually inside Nagaland. The team went inside Nagaland in pursuit of the criminal due to confusion and misleading guidance on GPS. Of the 16 personnel, only three were in uniform and the rest were in civil dress. This also led to confusion among the locals. They also attacked the team and one of our personnel was injured. The locals then realised that it was a genuine police team from Assam and released five members, including the injured person. They, however, held the remaining 11 persons as captives overnight.

According to Ford, Trump’s understanding of the industry has evolved since his initial years in office, noting that it took some “education” to help Trump grasp the complexities of the sector during his first term.Despite the close ties between Trump and Musk, CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc., Ford is not concerned that this alliance will harm legacy automakers. Ford stressed that both Tesla and traditional automakers like Ford are aligned on many important issues, including the future of manufacturing and the overall direction of the automotive industry.Ford said that considering Trump has his number, ""I feel very confident that, going forward, Ford will have a voice, and a seat at the table.""Talking about Chinese competition on electric vehicles , Ford said, ""It's not matching the technology.

"Disney, Fox, Warner Bros' Venu Sports streaming plan is Dead: ""After careful consideration, we have ...,"" says the joint statement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/disney-fox-warner-bros-venu-sports-streaming-plan-is-dead-after-careful-consideration-we-have-says-the-joint-statement/articleshow/117129364.cms,"What's behind the scrapping of Venu Sports

The Walt Disney Co., Fox Corp. , and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. have abandoned their plans to launch a joint sports streaming service, Venu Sports , just days after reaching a settlement in a lawsuit that challenged the venture's potential anti-competitive impact.The companies announced the discontinuation of Venu Sports in a joint statement, citing the ""ever-changing marketplace"" and a desire to ""meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels."" They also expressed gratitude to the Venu staff and pledged support during the transition.“After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service,” the companies said in a statement. “In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels. We are proud of the work that has been done on Venu to date and grateful to the Venu staff, whom we will support through this transition period,” the statement added.The decision follows a legal challenge initiated by FuboTV Inc. , a sports-focused streaming service, which argued that Venu Sports would stifle competition and harm consumers. FuboTV contended that the joint venture would exclude them from carrying certain key sports channels, potentially forcing them out of business, and would ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also signaled its intention to scrutinize the project for potential antitrust violations.The concept for Venu Sports emerged last year as the three media giants sought to combine their valuable sports content into a single streaming package, targeting viewers who desired access to live sports without traditional cable subscriptions. The proposed service immediately drew opposition, culminating in FuboTV's lawsuit.Despite this settlement, other industry players continued to express concerns. EchoStar Corp. and pay-TV provider DirecTV Inc. submitted a letter to Judge Garnett, arguing that Disney's agreement with FuboTV did not fully address the underlying anti-competitive issues posed by the Venu Sports concept.The abandonment of Venu Sports comes as live sports remains a highly lucrative sector of the television industry. With the ongoing trend of cord-cutting, media companies are actively reassessing how to package and distribute sports content to reach audiences.","Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. announced the discontinuation of Venu Sports in a joint statement.

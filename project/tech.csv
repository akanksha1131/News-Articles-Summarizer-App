'Godfather of AI’ warns ChatGPT maker OpenAI and other tech giants about competing with DeepSeek,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-warns-chatgpt-maker-openai-and-other-tech-giants-about-competing-with-deepseek/articleshow/117765545.cms,"What the ‘godfather of AI’ said about the AI race

“It’s going to mean a closer race, which usually is not a good thing from the point of view of

AI safety

. If you imagine a competition between two entities and one thinks they’re way ahead, then they can afford to be more prudent and still know that they will stay ahead. Whereas if you have a competition between two entities and they think that the other is just at the same level, then they need to accelerate. Then maybe they don’t give as much attention to safety.”

A new report by experts has warned about how the increasing competition among tech majors may boost the malicious use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The report’s lead author, Yoshua Bengio , also known as “one of the godfathers of modern AI,” highlighted the risks associated with the rapid advancement of AI technology, particularly with the emergence of companies like DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that has challenged US dominance in the field.He expressed concerns about DeepSeek 's rapid progress, emphasising the need for greater attention to safety and ethical considerations in AI development. Bengio has also warned that competitors, including US companies, may start prioritising regaining their lead by compromising safety.in an interview with the Guardian, Bengio said:The first full International AI Safety report, led by Turing Award winner Yoshua Bengio and compiled by 96 experts, was announced at the 2023 AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park.Commissioned by the UK government, the report highlights the increasing risks posed by AI, including its potential for malicious use in cybersecurity and bioweapons development.It warns that AI can now generate detailed instructions for creating biological threats, surpassing expert capabilities. However, its impact on novices remains uncertain.While acknowledging risks, the report also emphasises AI’s benefits, particularly in medicine. The next global AI summit is set for February in Paris.","Yoshua Bengio, one of the 'godfathers of modern AI', warns of risks associated with rapid advancement of AI technology.

Why AT&T CEO sees little reason to worry about China's DeepSeek: There will be days when ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-att-ceo-sees-little-reason-to-worry-about-chinas-deepseek-there-will-be-days-when-/articleshow/117753167.cms,"It's because we are early in the race

""Because we’re very early in it, we should expect there’s going to be days we wake up like this one when somebody comes in and says they figured out a way to get as much benefit out of the model by consuming less power or using less processing capability or they fine-tune the models to work in a particular domain area more effectively or they can run locally as opposed to in the cloud, which is going to open up and facilitate new applications and business models.""

DeepSeek is a hot topic on earnings calls this quarter. And it was no different at AT&T's earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2024. AT&T CEO John Stankey was asked about DeepSeek that shocked US stock market earlier this week, wiping out billions from market capital of technology companies led by AI chip giant Nvidia.AT&T CEO Stankey was asked about the impact of Deepseek and if the company planned to use cloud and AI to both improve relationships with customers, improve product and lowering their overall expenses.To this Stankey replied, ""We’ve used it a lot internally in our operations. We’re seeing demonstrative improvements in our code effectiveness. And I shared this on a previous call, we’re spending less right now to develop new code internally and getting more. And it’s through the application of AI and the technology and what we’re able to do with generative AI.""Commenting further on the impact of DeepSeek, he said,""I would expect for a nascent technology like this that we’re going to have those moments because necessity is the mother of invention. And there’s a lot of money, an awful lot of money and a lot of creative minds working on this. And people are going to come up with better ways to apply it,"" he added.""And we’re all going to have to stay on our game to make sure we use it effectively so none of us are in a disadvantaged position relative to our competitors on cost structure effectiveness. I think there are places where I would like to see our business get better at doing this, which is using the data that we have to start doing things that are unique to us, which handling particular customers and segments of the base and those that we don’t have as customers and understanding how we price and attack those things and using the unique data sets that we have around our infrastructure, how that lines up to particular customer segments, in particular, industries to get more effective in the market,"" we went on to add.Talking about the gaol for 20025, Stankey said, ""If I were to say I had a goal for 2025, I would like to this time next year be talking about good momentum we’ve received in business as a result of executing on some of those things moving forward.""","DeepSeek is a hot topic on earnings calls this quarter.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has threatened legal action against Minnesota Governor Tim Walz following the governor's claim that Musk performed a “Nazi salute.” The controversy arose from a video in which Walz stated, “Of course he did,” referring to Musk's gesture at former U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration event. The remark quickly went viral, prompting widespread discussion on social media.Musk responded to the video on X (formerly Twitter), calling Walz “creepy” and indicating that he intends to sue.The debate stems from a gesture Musk made at the event, which some have likened to the Nazi salute , while others—including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)—dismissed it as an ""awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm."" The incident has fueled broader discussions on political rhetoric, historical symbolism, and the role of social media in amplifying controversies.The controversy began on January 20, during Donald Trump’s inauguration event, when Musk placed his right hand on his chest before extending his arm diagonally upward with his palm facing down. He repeated the motion twice. The gesture led to differing interpretations, with some critics suggesting it resembled the Nazi salute, historically associated with Adolf Hitler’s regime in Nazi Germany and Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italy.Others, however, argued that the gesture had alternative explanations. Some described it as a “Roman salute,” which has historical roots in ancient Rome but has since been appropriated by various political movements. Others believed it was simply an awkward movement or an expression of enthusiasm.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization that monitors antisemitism and hate speech, weighed in on the controversy. While acknowledging that the Nazi salute is ""the most common white supremacist hand sign in the world,"" the ADL ultimately concluded that Musk’s motion was not intentional and did not constitute a Nazi salute. Instead, the organization categorized it as an ""awkward gesture"" rather than a deliberate expression of extremism.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz made the comment during a discussion where he appeared to affirm that Musk had, in fact, made a Nazi salute. In a widely shared video on X, Walz stated, “Of course he did,” when referring to Musk’s gesture. His remark quickly sparked reactions online, with some criticizing the governor for making what they viewed as an unfounded accusation.A user on X shared the clip of Walz’s statement with the caption:Musk responded directly to the post, writing:This public exchange intensified the debate, with Musk suggesting he would take legal action against Walz over the remark.The discussion surrounding Musk’s gesture and Walz’s comments extended beyond the two individuals, sparking broader debates on social media. Some users supported Musk, arguing that accusations of Nazi symbolism should not be made lightly, especially when organizations like the ADL did not find evidence of extremist intent.Andrea Stroppa, an associate of Musk in Italy, initially posted on X, saying, ""The Roman Empire is back, starting from the Roman salute."" However, after facing backlash and concerns that the comment linked Musk’s gesture to Nazi-fascism, Stroppa deleted the post.Musk himself dismissed the allegations, responding to the controversy with a post on X:The incident highlights the ongoing political and cultural tensions surrounding historical symbolism and the speed at which social media can amplify controversies. It also raises questions about how public figures, particularly those with significant influence like Musk, navigate politically charged accusations and public scrutiny.","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz made the comment during a discussion where he appeared to affirm that Musk had, in fact, made a Nazi salute.

China's DeepSeek faces its first ban: Italy blocks it on iPhones and Android phones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-deepseek-faces-its-first-ban-italy-blocks-it-on-iphones-and-android-phones/articleshow/117751453.cms,"What Italy said about blocking DeepSeek app



“The news of the withdrawal of the app was only a few hours ago, I cannot say whether it is due to us or not. Our office will launch an in-depth investigation to see if GDPR rules are being respected.""

“Of course, the security authorities are concerned with AI applications and possible manipulation, possible influence on the formation of public opinion through AI applications, especially now in view of the Bundestag elections.”

Italy has become the first country to block DeepSeek . A report claims that the Chinese artificial intelligence app has been removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the country. This action follows a request for information from the Italian data protection authority about the app's use of personal data.A notice on Apple's App Store started informing Italian users that the DeepSeek app was ""currently not available in the country or area."" Similarly, Google's Play Store also displayed a message stating that the download was ""not supported"" in Italy, the report noted.However, DeepSeek remained accessible for Italian users who had previously downloaded it and was still available for download and functioning in other European Union countries and the UK, the report added.In a statement to the news agency ANSA (seen by Reuters), Pasquale Stanzione, the head of the Italian data regulator confirmed the removal of the DeepSeek app from Apple and Google’s respective app stores.He said:Stanzione also mentioned that the EU’s leading AI watchdog that previously temporarily banned ChatGPT over suspected privacy violations, Garante, has requested details on the collection of personal data. This includes its sources, purposes, legal basis and whether it is stored in China. DeepSeek and its affiliated companies have been given 20 days to respond.He also emphasised that the regulator is seeking assurances regarding safeguards for underage users, measures to prevent bias, and protections against electoral interference, the report added.DeepSeek, which launched a free AI assistant last week, quickly gained popularity, even surpassing ChatGPT in downloads on Apple's App Store. However, concerns about data privacy have led to this ban in Italy, the report claims.Apart from this, Ireland's Data Protection Commission has also requested information about DeepSeek's data processing practices.Moreover, a spokesperson for the interior ministry of Germany stated that the government is monitoring AI apps for potential interference ahead of the national election on February 23.Without naming any specific models, the spokesperson said:",Italy has become the first country to block DeepSeek.

Errol Musk , the father of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk , has long been a subject of public intrigue due to his professional achievements, controversial personal life, and complex relationship with his son. As an engineer and businessman, Errol played a significant role in shaping his children's early exposure to technology and innovation. In a recent interview on The Ahmad Mahmood Show, he shared insights into his early career, financial success, and views on Elon Musk’s upbringing.His comments directly contradict claims made by the Tesla and SpaceX CEO regarding a challenging childhood, adding another layer to the ongoing debate about the Musk family's history.During the interview, Errol Musk recounted how he built his career from an early age, achieving financial success and securing a luxurious lifestyle. He also addressed long-standing speculation regarding his son’s financial upbringing, disputing Elon Musk’s previous claims of hardship. These remarks come nearly two years after Elon stated that he did not grow up wealthy and received no inheritance or financial assistance in building his empire. The ongoing public discourse between father and son has reignited curiosity about Errol Musk’s own life, his ventures, and his influence on one of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs.Errol Musk refuting Elon Musk’s ‘unhappy childhood’ claimsA major point of contention between father and son has been their differing recollections of Elon Musk’s childhood. While the Tesla CEO has described his upbringing as neither particularly joyful nor financially privileged, Errol Musk directly refuted this in the interview.""Nobody intentionally desires hardship, but I firmly believe that if everything comes too easily, there is little valuable knowledge gained from the experience,"" Errol said. He further claimed that Elon Musk traveled to school in a Rolls-Royce, reinforcing his assertion that his children grew up in comfort.Elon Musk, however, has repeatedly denied growing up in wealth. Responding to a user on X (formerly Twitter), he stated, “I grew up in a family that shifted from a lower-income background to an upper-middle-class setting. However, my childhood was not a joyful one. I have never received any inheritance from anyone, nor has anyone ever given me a large monetary gift.”Musk also mentioned that while his father’s business was initially successful, it eventually struggled, leaving Errol financially dependent on Elon and his brother, Kimbal Musk, for the past 25 years.Errol Musk’s early career and financial successErrol Musk began his professional journey as an independent consulting engineer, a field he entered unexpectedly but ultimately excelled in. He emphasized that his dedication to working long hours, including weekends, set him apart from his peers. This relentless work ethic led to financial stability at a young age, allowing him to achieve milestones that most professionals reach decades later.""By 26, I had attained the same professional standing as men in their mid-to-late forties. At 24, I was already running my own company, which allowed me to have flexibility and spend time at home with my children. At just 23 or 24, I even acquired my first aircraft,"" Errol Musk shared.One of his most notable achievements was purchasing the house where Elon Musk spent much of his childhood—a property now occupied by the European Union’s ambassador to South Africa. His early financial prosperity, he claimed, allowed his family to enjoy a privileged lifestyle, a stark contrast to Elon Musk’s own accounts of his upbringing.Errol Musk’s ventures and business historyBeyond his engineering career, Errol Musk has made headlines for his business ventures, including a controversial claim about owning an emerald mine. He previously stated that he once held a 50% stake in a Zambian emerald mine, a purchase he made on impulse. He recounted that he and a fellow pilot were flying an aircraft from South Africa to England with the intent to sell it. When an expected layover in Saudi Arabia was canceled, he made an unplanned decision that altered his financial trajectory.In another interview with Business Insider South Africa, Errol Musk claimed that there was a time when his financial earnings were so substantial that he struggled to manage them. These accounts of wealth and unconventional business dealings have fueled public curiosity and speculation about his financial history.The complex father-son relationshipThe rift between Elon Musk and his father has been widely documented. Their strained relationship reportedly began following the divorce of Elon’s parents and has remained tense ever since. While Errol Musk frequently discusses his experiences, he presents perspectives that often contradict those of his son.Despite their differences, Errol’s influence on Elon Musk’s early life is undeniable. His background in engineering and entrepreneurship likely contributed to Elon’s own passion for technology and innovation. However, their conflicting narratives about the past continue to shape public perception of both father and son.","Errol Musk is the father of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Bernstein report 'tells' what it says China's DeepSeek is not telling everyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bernstein-report-tells-what-it-says-chinas-deepseek-is-not-telling-everyone/articleshow/117702705.cms,"How to use deepseek AI

What DeepSeek is not telling

Bernstein Research 's recent report has tempered the hype surrounding DeepSeek, the Chinese startup whose low-cost AI assistant has caused a stir in the tech world and even impacted global markets. While acknowledging DeepSeek 's impressive capabilities, the report argues that claims of the AI being built for just $5 million are misleading and don't represent the full picture of its development costs.The Bernstein report directly addresses the narrative surrounding DeepSeek's supposed budget: ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT 'build OpenAI for USD 5M'; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" The report emphasizes that the ""fantastic"" results achieved by DeepSeek shouldn't be mistaken for miraculous, and the market reaction, particularly the impact on Nvidia, was disproportionate to the reality of the situation.DeepSeek has developed two primary AI model families: DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1 . The V3 model is a large language model (LLM) utilizing a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) architecture. Bernstein's analysis reveals that training the V3 model required significant computational resources. DeepSeek employed a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs for approximately two months. This translates to roughly 2.7 million GPU hours for pre-training and a total of 2.8 million GPU hours when including post-training. GPU hours represent the cumulative time a graphics processing unit is actively engaged in processing tasks, highlighting the substantial investment in computational power.The report underscores that the widely cited ""$5 million"" figure fails to account for the extensive research, development, experimentation, personnel costs, and other associated expenses inherent in developing such a complex model. It's not simply a matter of hardware costs; the figure omits the significant investment in talent and time required for AI research and development.The unveiling of DeepSeek's assistant had a dramatic effect on the market, particularly on AI chip leader Nvidia. On January 27th, Nvidia experienced a record single-day loss in market value, close to $593 billion, driven by fears that Chinese AI models like DeepSeek's could gain a competitive edge over more expensive American counterparts. Bernstein's report suggests that this market reaction was an overreaction.While the V3 model's training resources were detailed, the report notes that the R1 model, which was considered particularly impressive, lacked similar quantification in DeepSeek's research paper. This raises questions about the true cost and resources involved in developing the R1 model.In conclusion, Bernstein acknowledges DeepSeek's achievements as ""fantastic"" but argues that the claim of building an OpenAI-level competitor for $5 million is ""exaggerated"" and ""overblown."" The report provides a more nuanced perspective, highlighting the substantial computational resources and likely hidden costs involved in developing advanced AI models like DeepSeek's, and suggesting that the market's reaction to the company's emergence may have been disproportionate.",Chinese startup DeepSeek's low-cost AI assistant has caused a stir in the tech world and even impacted global markets.

OpenAI questioned Delhi Court's territorial jurisdiction in copyright case

NewYork Times sues OpenAI and Microsoft over AI use of copyrighted work

AI industry's one of the biggest and most common names ChatGPT maker OpenAI is worried. Reason: It says that Chinese companies are actively attempting to replicate its advanced AI models. ""We know (China) based companies -- and others -- are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,"" an OpenAI spokesperson told news agency AFP.OpenAI further said that the process was against its terms of service and it would work at detecting and preventing further attempts.We ""believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology,"" the spokesperson added.While OpenAI, Microsoft and some in the US government are crying foul; many across the internet are not amused. For, the company led by Sam Altman is itself facing multiple accusations of intellectual property violations, primarily related to the use of copyrighted materials in training its generative AI models.Such Copyright infringement cases against ChatGPT abound across the world. Courts across the world are hearing claims by authors, news outlets and musicians who accuse ChatGPT of using their copyright work to train AI services and who are seeking to have content used to train the chatbot deleted.Earlier this month, the New Delhi-based Federation of Indian Publishers filed a case at the Delhi High Court against OpenAI, which is already facing similar lawsuits in the same court. The case has been filed on behalf of all the federation's members, who include publishers like Bloomsbury (BLPU.L), opens new tab, Penguin Random House, Cambridge University Press and Pan Macmillan, as well as India's Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co. ""Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content,"" Pranav Gupta, the federation's general secretary told Reuters about the lawsuit, which concerns the ChatGPT tool's book summaries.Not just this, the Indian media outlets, including NDTV and Network18 have told the Delhi High Court that they want to join the ongoing lawsuit against ChatGPT creator OpenAI as they are worried their news websites are being scraped to store and reproduce their work for users of the powerful AI tool. The 135-page case filing, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters, argues OpenAI's conduct constitutes ""a clear and present danger to the valuable copyrights"" of Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) members and other outlets.In November 2024, the Delhi High Court issued summons to OpenAI in a lawsuit filed by news agency Asian News International (ANI) over use of its news content “without any license or permission”, by the advanced AI-powered chatbot to provide services to its users.Responding to the same earlier this month, Open AI’s counsel questioned the territorial jurisdiction of courts in India to decide the issue. Senior advocate Amit Sibal, representing OpenAI, said that the organisation operates internationally, with no servers or offices in India.In 2024, the New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft for the unpermitted use of Times articles to train GPT large language models.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI is worried that Chinese companies are attempting to replicate its advanced AI models.

Despite recent shockwaves sent through the tech industry by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, Microsoft and Meta CEOs have defended their companies' massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI). DeepSeek's claims of achieving comparable AI performance at a fraction of the cost have raised questions about the sustainability of big tech's AI spending strategies.In their respective post-earnings calls on Wednesday, both Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta emphasised the strategic importance of investing heavily in AI infrastructure.“Investing ‘very heavily’ in capital expenditure and infrastructure is going to be a strategic advantage over time,” Zuckerberg said on a post-earnings call.Nadella echoed Zuckerberg's comments saying that the spending is needed to overcome the capacity constraints that have hampered the technology giant's ability to capitalize on AI.“As AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand,” he said on a call with analysts.Even Microsoft CFO Amy Hood hinted at spending in the current quarter saying that it will be around the $22.6 billion level seen in the second quarter.“In fiscal 2026, we expect to continue to invest against strong demand signals. However, the growth rate will be lower than fiscal 2025 (which ends in June),” she said.These statements come as DeepSeek's rapid progress and cost-effective approach have sparked a global selloff in tech stocks, with investors concerned about the potential impact on US AI giants like Nvidia and Microsoft.DeepSeek claims to have developed its AI model for roughly $6 million, a stark contrast to the tens of billions of dollars Microsoft and Meta have allocated to AI.However, US tech executives and analysts argue that DeepSeek's figures likely represent only a portion of its total development costs, focusing primarily on computing power.","DeepSeek claims to have developed its AI model for roughly $6 million, a stark contrast to the tens of billions of dollars Microsoft and Meta have allocated to AI.

OpenAI, Microsoft to probe DeepSeek

DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup, is facing increasing scrutiny and accusations of technology copying. Following allegations from competitors like OpenAI as well as US President Donald Trump’s AI advisor David Sacks , Indian-American billionaire Vinod Khosla has now accused DeepSeek of “ripping off” the technology behind its R1 model.As per Khosla, its DeepSeek chatbot makes the same mistakes as OpenAI’s o1, raising suspicion of intellectual property theft.“One of our startups found Deepseek makes the same mistakes O1 makes, a strong indication the technology was ripped off,” Khosla said.“It feels like they [DeepSeek] then hacked some code and did some impressive optimizations on top. Most likely, not an effort from scratch,” Khosla added.The company's R1 large language model (LLM) rose to prominence after reports said that it delivers performance comparable to its US rivals but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's rapid rise and cost-effective approach have disrupted the AI landscape, wiping out an estimated $1 trillion from US tech stocks this week.The success has fueled speculation that the company may have achieved its breakthrough by copying or reverse-engineering existing technologies. There is, however, no concrete evidence to support the allegations.OpenAI and Microsoft are investigating whether Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek leveraged OpenAI’s models to train its own AI, according to a Bloomberg report. The inquiry comes after DeepSeek, known for its cost-effective AI development, introduced models that compete with OpenAI’s flagship offerings, triggering concerns about potential intellectual property violations According to a Bloomberg report, OpenAI and Microsoft are investigating whether the Chinese AI firm improperly used OpenAI's technology to develop its own competing AI models. The investigation has reportedly been triggered by concerns that DeepSeek may have violated OpenAI's terms of service by extracting data from its models to train its own.Sources told the publication that Microsoft's security teams detected suspicious data activity in late 2024, potentially involving large-scale data extraction from OpenAI through developer accounts linked to DeepSeek.OpenAI also reportedly found evidence of AI model distillation, a process where smaller AI models are trained using data from larger, more powerful models.",Vinod Khosla accuses DeepSeek of 'ripping off' technology behind its R1 model.

How Apple can tackle these security flaws



Apple Silicon chips — like the M2, M3, A15, and A17 chips — use the speculative execution feature to predict user tasks and improve speed. However, this feature may comes with security risks. New research has revealed that when these predictions are incorrect, they can create vulnerabilities that hackers may exploit to steal sensitive information, such as emails and credit card details of iPhone , iPad and Mac users.Apple Silicon, known for its high performance in iPads and Macs, relies on this feature to maintain efficiency. However, the same mechanism that makes these chips fast also introduces potential security flaws.Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology have discovered two security vulnerabilities in Apple's latest processors, dubbed SLAP and FLOP. These flaws affect M2, M3, A15, and A17 chips by exploiting memory prediction features designed to boost performance.SLAP (Speculative Execution via Load Address Prediction) allows attackers to access private data, such as email content, by tricking the processor into using out-of-bounds memory. FLOP (False Load Output Prediction) is even more severe, bypassing memory safety checks to recover sensitive data like credit card details.To expose its fatalities, researchers also demonstrated how SLAP can extract private emails from Safari, while FLOP can retrieve financial data. Although there is no evidence of real-world exploitation yet, the potential security risk remains.SLAP and FLOP are speculative execution attacks are similar to the widely publicised Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities from a few years ago. However, its important to note these flaws specifically target Apple’s hardware.While Apple has not yet released a fix, the company is aware of the vulnerabilities in Apple Silicon. The researchers who discovered SLAP and FLOP alerted Apple about the issues—one flaw about a year ago and the other six months ago.By then, the M4 chip was already in development. Full fixes typically require chip-level adjustments, which won’t be possible until the next generation of processors. In the meantime, software updates may help mitigate the risks.If your Mac, iPhone, or iPad is powered by an M2, M3, A15, or A17 chip, it is vulnerable to these security flaws. This includes devices like the M2 MacBook Air, iPhone 15 Pro, and the latest iPads.Older devices with M1 chips or earlier are not affected by these specific vulnerabilities, though they may still face other risks.To protect your devices, ensure they are updated with the latest software and security patches. Stay cautious by avoiding untrusted websites, disabling JavaScript when not needed and using browser extensions that block scripts.","SLAP (Speculative Execution via Load Address Prediction) allows attackers to access private data, such as email content, by tricking the processor into using out-of-bounds memory.

It was a wild ride with lots of chapters - dangerous capability evals, agent safety/control, AGI and online identity, etc. - and I'll miss many parts of it.

‘Terrified by pace of AI development’

Honestly I'm pretty terrified by the pace of AI development these days. When I think about where I'll raise a future family, or how much to save for retirement, I can't help but wonder: Will humanity even make it to that point?

IMO, an AGI race is a very risky gamble, with huge downside. No lab has a solution to AI alignment today. And the faster we race, the less likely that anyone finds one in time.

Today, it seems like we're stuck in a really bad equilibrium. Even if a lab truly wants to develop AGI responsibly, others can still cut corners to catch up, maybe disastrously. And this pushes all to speed up. I hope labs can be candid about real safety regs needed to stop this.

Another safety researcher has left OpenAI , expressing concerns about the escalating race towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Steven Adler , who spent four years at the leading AI research company, announced his departure via a post on X (formerly Twitter).He did not elaborate on the specific reasons for his departure from OpenAI, but his post highlights growing anxieties within the AI community about the potential risks associated with increasingly powerful AI systems.In his posts, Adler said that he is terrified with the pace of AI development.He also criticised the competitive environment surrounding AGI development , suggesting that the rush to achieve AGI between leading AI labs and global superpowers could have unintended consequences.Adler's departure comes at a time of heightened scrutiny for the AI field, with the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek further intensifying the global competition in AI development.Last year, Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old former OpenAI researcher, was found dead at his apartment.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, have once again made headlines with their philanthropic efforts, awarding $100 million as part of the Courage and Civility Award, as per reports. This year’s recipients, actress and activist Eva Longoria and retired Navy Admiral Bill McRaven, each received $50 million to advance their respective charitable missions.Since its inception in 2021, the Courage and Civility Award has recognized individuals making significant contributions to society, with past recipients including Van Jones, José Andrés, and Dolly Parton.With an estimated net worth of approximately $248 billion, Bezos has pledged to dedicate a substantial portion of his wealth to philanthropic causes. The Courage and Civility Award is among several initiatives through which he has sought to make a meaningful impact on global and community-based issues. Longoria and McRaven have already begun allocating their funds toward causes that align with their long-standing commitments to social good, further reinforcing the importance of Bezos’s award in supporting impactful philanthropy.Jeff Bezos launched the Courage and Civility Award in 2021 to support individuals who demonstrate leadership in tackling global and social issues. The award aims to empower change-makers with substantial financial resources, enabling them to scale their efforts. Past winners have used their grants to fund projects related to climate change, education, food security, and social justice.During the announcement of the inaugural award, Bezos emphasized the need for unity and constructive discourse in addressing global challenges. “We need unifiers and not vilifiers,” he stated, underscoring his desire to support leaders who engage in meaningful, solution-oriented initiatives.Eva Longoria, best known for her role in Desperate Housewives, has long been an advocate for social justice, particularly within the Latina community. She founded the Eva Longoria Foundation to support Latinas through education, mentorship, and entrepreneurial opportunities. Additionally, her organization, Eva’s Heroes, provides resources and programs for individuals with special needs.With the $50 million grant from the Courage and Civility Award, Longoria plans to expand her foundation’s initiatives. She has pledged a portion of the funds to wildfire relief efforts in Los Angeles, demonstrating her commitment to addressing immediate community needs. Longoria has also emphasized the importance of empowering women, stating, “When you help a woman, she helps her family. And when you help families, you improve communities. And when you improve communities, you can improve nations.”Admiral Bill McRaven, a retired four-star Navy officer and former chancellor of the University of Texas System, has dedicated much of his post-military career to education and veteran support. McRaven is best known for overseeing the 2011 operation that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden, but he has also been a strong advocate for leadership development, particularly among military personnel.With his share of the award, McRaven has committed to supporting future military leaders and the families of fallen service members. His initiatives include the development of education programs for veterans and active-duty personnel, as well as mental health resources. Last fall, McRaven donated $1 million to UT Southwestern Medical Center for research on Gulf War Illness and veterans’ mental health.“The opportunity to use this incredible gift to help veterans and their families is the dream of a lifetime, and I am so grateful to Lauren and Jeff for giving me this opportunity,” McRaven stated in a press release.Beyond the Courage and Civility Award, Bezos has made substantial contributions to various causes. He has committed $10 billion to climate change initiatives through the Bezos Earth Fund, which seeks to advance global efforts to combat environmental challenges. Additionally, the Bezos Day 1 Families Fund has allocated nearly $640 million to support homeless families, with $117 million in grants distributed in 2023 alone.Despite these contributions, Bezos has faced criticism for not signing the Giving Pledge, an initiative founded by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett that encourages billionaires to donate at least half of their wealth to charitable causes. While his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, has been one of the most prolific donors in recent history, Bezos’s philanthropic strategy remains under scrutiny.","Jeff Bezos launched the Courage and Civility Award in 2021 to support individuals who demonstrate leadership in tackling global and social issues.

Like LLaMA (LLM by Meta), which is open source, this too can be hosted on Indian servers.Data privacy issues regarding DeepSeek can be addressed by hosting open-source models on Indian servers,” Vaishnaw said during his address at the Utkarsh Odisha Conclave.According to DeepSeek's policy, the company stores data collected in servers located in China.Vaishnaw also announced that India will develop its own generative AI model, saying the model will be powered by the India AI Compute Facility . The minister compared the computational power used in training different AI models.“DeepSeek AI was trained on 2,000 GPUs, ChatGPT was trained on 25,000 GPUs, and we now have 15,000 high-end GPUs available. India now has a robust compute facility that will support our AI ambitions,"" he said.India AI Compute Facility has secured [nearly] 19,000 GPUs to develop a LLM designed specifically for the country. Out of these, 15,000 are high-end. With this, the government has overreached its target of 10,000 GPUs.“We have created the framework, and it is being launched today. Our focus is on building AI models that maintain the Indian context and culture,” Vaishnaw stated.This strategy enables India to harness advanced AI technology while safeguarding its data and adhering to local regulations.“With algorithmic efficiency, we can create these models in a much shorter time frame. We will have a world-class foundational AI model in just a few months,” the minister said.By strengthening high-performance computing infrastructure, Indian researchers and developers will have the resources to train and deploy advanced AI models.",IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has underscored India's expanding artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.

CEO of Dutch chipmaker ASML on why DeepSeek’s R1 model is ‘good news’ for AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-of-dutch-chipmaker-asml-on-why-deepseeks-r1-model-is-good-news-for-ai/articleshow/117691953.cms,"‘AI will benefit everyone’

The CEO of Dutch chipmaking giant ASML , Christophe Fouquet , has projected optimism for the AI industry despite the recent market turmoil caused by the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and its model R1.During ASML’s fourth-quarter earnings call, Fouquet said that onlookers shouldn’t have been so surprised by the arrival of a new player in the AI race, saying that the industry must expect such “elephants in the room”.“I know some of you, maybe, were surprised in the last few days that a new company suddenly comes and wants to compete. Well, I think we have to get used to that, because this is such an opportunity that there will be more and more players to grab this,” Fouquet said, as power Fortune.His comments came after DeepSeek’s powerful and cost-effective AI models triggered a massive selloff in semiconductor stocks, with ASML and Nvidia among the hardest hit, and wiping off $1 trillion in US tech market.However, Fouquet downplayed these concerns, stating that falling costs in the AI industry would ultimately benefit everyone.“AI is a huge opportunity. Therefore, I think you should expect to see a few elephants in the room in the next few months, or few years, because everyone will want to be in,” he added.Fouquet argued that lower costs would drive wider adoption of AI, ultimately increasing demand for the advanced chips ASML produces. He compared the situation to Moore's Law , which has driven down the cost of computing power for decades, fueling innovation and growth in the tech industry.“Moore’s Law is about reducing cost every single generation so that you create more opportunity,” said Fouquet.“So I will say, in general, that any technology, whatever it is, that will contribute to a cost reduction over all of AI, will increase the opportunity. This has been true in this industry for the last 40-60, years. I think it’s still true moving forward,” he added.","Christophe Fouquet, CEO of Dutch chipmaking giant ASML, has projected optimism for the AI industry.

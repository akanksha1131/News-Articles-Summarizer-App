"Amazon and Microsoft-backed startup to build Recycling Plant of rare earths in Canada, the 'rare minerals' that analysts say gives China upper hand in trade war with the US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-and-microsoft-backed-startup-to-build-recycling-plant-of-rare-earths-in-canada-the-rare-minerals-that-analysts-say-gives-china-upper-hand-in-trade-war-with-the-us/articleshow/121787570.cms,"What is the rare earth minerals tussle between US and China

Cyclic Materials , a startup supported by Amazon, Microsoft, and BMW Group, plans to invest $25 million in a rare-earths recycling plant and research center in Ontario, Canada, according to a statement reported by Bloomberg. The facility, set to begin operations in the first quarter of 2026, aims to bolster North America’s supply of critical minerals amid rising global demand and China’s dominance over rare-earth markets.Cyclic’s technology extracts rare earths from end-of-life products like wind turbines, data-center hard drives, and electric vehicle components, addressing supply chain vulnerabilities highlighted by China’s export restrictions in retaliation to U.S. tariffs, Bloomberg noted. The company already operates a demonstration facility in Kingston and a processing site in Arizona.The rare earth minerals issue between the U.S. and China centers on a trade dispute over critical minerals essential for advanced technologies, including defense systems, electric vehicles, semiconductors, and renewable energy. China mines about 70% of the world's rare earth elements (17 metallic elements with unique properties) and processes over 90%, giving it significant control over global supply chains. They also produce 85% of rare earth magnets used in electric motors and other tech.“Rare-earth elements are a $20 billion to $30 billion market globally, but they unlock multi-trillion-dollar industries,” Ahmad Ghahreman, CEO of Cyclic Materials, told Bloomberg. “We are creating a secure, local supply for these critical metals.” The Kingston plant is designed to process 500 metric tons of feedstock annually, producing rare-earth oxides for magnets used in EV motors, wind turbines, and consumer electronics. Feedstock will be sourced from Cyclic’s Arizona facility and a network of partners, with output supplied to companies like Solvay SA.The project aligns with Canada’s push to become a hub for critical minerals, supported by government incentives and growing interest from automakers and tech giants. Cyclic’s initiative could reduce reliance on Chinese rare earths, which account for over 80% of global supply, per Bloomberg. The research center will also develop advanced recycling techniques, positioning Cyclic to meet surging demand for sustainable mineral sources in industries critical to the green energy transition.","Cyclic Materials plans to invest $25 million in a rare-earths recycling plant and research center in Ontario, Canada.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds with emoji

US economy in tough place

Warren Buffet and Mike Lee proposal aims to fix responsibility

The U.S. government has been grappling with persistent budget deficits, spending far more than it collects in revenue year after year. Despite efforts from both political parties, the national debt has ballooned to $33.8 trillion as of June 2025, with no clear end in sight. Amid this fiscal crisis, a radical idea from legendary investor Warren Buffett is gaining renewed attention and high-profile support. In a 2011 CNBC interview, Buffett proposed a strikingly simple solution to curb runaway deficits: “I could end the deficit in five minutes. You just pass a law that says that any time there's a deficit of more than 3% of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election.” The resurfaced clip has gone viral, sparking a heated debate about accountability in Washington.Utah Senator Mike Lee amplified the idea by reposting the video on X, asking, “Would you support this amendment?” The post ignited a firestorm of responses, including a resounding endorsement from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk, who wrote, “100%. This is the way.” Other prominent voices, including economist Peter Schiff, chimed in, tweeting, “Buffett’s plan is brutal but brilliant. Congress would finally feel the heat of their own fiscal mess.”Lee isn’t just stirring the pot online—he’s taking action. “I’m drafting a constitutional amendment to oust every member of Congress whenever inflation exceeds 3%. It’s better to disqualify politicians than for an entire nation to suffer under the yoke of inflation,” he wrote on X. Lee’s proposal tweaks Buffett’s original idea, tying congressional eligibility to inflation rather than deficits, though both metrics are closely linked to government spending.The U.S. fiscal situation paints a grim picture. In fiscal 2024, the U.S. economy generated $28.83 trillion in GDP, while federal spending reached $6.75 trillion against $4.92 trillion in revenue, resulting in a $1.83 trillion deficit—6.3% of GDP, double Buffett’s proposed threshold. The Congressional Budget Office projects deficits will climb to $2.6 trillion by 2034, driven by rising interest payments on the national debt, now costing over $1 trillion annually.Economists have long warned about the link between deficits and inflation. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman famously argued, “What produces [inflation] is too much government spending and too much government creation of money and nothing else.” Recent data supports this: inflation hit 3.2% in 2024, above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, fueled partly by expansive fiscal policies. The M2 money supply, a key driver of inflation, grew by 6% in 2024, according to Federal Reserve reports, reflecting continued monetary expansion.Buffett’s and Lee’s proposals aim to force accountability by tying lawmakers’ jobs to economic outcomes. However, passing a constitutional amendment is a daunting task, requiring two-thirds approval in both the House and Senate and ratification by 38 states. Critics argue the plan could backfire. “Kicking out every member of Congress during a deficit spike could paralyze governance and lead to inexperienced replacements,” said political analyst Sarah Klein in a recent Washington Post op-ed. Others note that deficits often surge during crises—like pandemics or recessions—when spending is necessary, potentially punishing lawmakers for unavoidable decisions.Supporters counter that the threat of mass ousting would incentivize fiscal discipline. “Congress has no skin in the game,” tweeted economist Nouriel Roubini. “Buffett’s idea flips that script.” Public sentiment on X leans heavily in favor, with polls showing 68% of 12,000 respondents supporting Lee’s amendment.","Warren Buffett proposed in 2011 that sitting members of Congress be ineligible for re-election if there's a deficit of more than 3% of GDP.

What is AI and how it works?



What are large language models (LLMs) and how are they trained?



How is AI helpful for people?



What is Agentic AI?



What is AGI?



Will AI take away our jobs and what people can do?



The tech world is changing fast, and it's all thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI). We're seeing amazing breakthroughs, from chatbots that can chat like a human to phones that are getting incredibly smart. This shift is making us ask bigger questions. It's no longer just about ""what can AI do right now?"" but more about ""what will AI become, and how will it affect our lives?""First, we got used to helpful chatbots. Then, the idea of a ""super smart"" AI, called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), started taking over headlines. Companies like Google , Microsoft , and OpenAI are all working hard to make AGI a reality. But even before AGI gets here, the tech world is buzzing about Agentic AI .With all these new terms and fast changes, it's easy for most of us who aren't deep in the tech world to feel a bit lost. If you're wondering what all this means for you, you're in the right place. In this simple guide, we'll answer your most important questions about the world of AI, helping you understand what's happening now and get ready for what's next.In the simplest terms, AI is about making machines – whether it's smartphones or laptops – smart. It's a field of computer science that creates systems capable of performing tasks that usually require human intelligence. Think of it as teaching computers to ""think"" or ""learn"" in a way that mimics how humans do. This task can include understanding human language, recognising patterns and even learning from experience.It uses its training -- just like humans -- in achieving its goal which is to solve problems and make decisions. That brings us to our next query: ""How is a machine trained to do tasks like humans?""While AI might seem like magic, it works on a few core principles. Just like humans get their information from observing, reading, listening and other sources, AI systems utilise vast amounts of data, including text, images, sounds, numbers and more.As mentioned above, AI systems need to learn and for that, they utilise Large Language Models, or LLMs. They are highly advanced AI programmes specifically designed to understand, generate and interact with human language. Think of them as incredibly knowledgeable digital brains that specialise in certain fields.LLMs are trained on enormous amounts of text data – billions and even trillions of words from books, articles, websites, conversations and more. This vast exposure allows them to learn the nuances of human language like grammar, context, facts and even different writing styles.For example, an LLM is like a teacher that has a vast amount of knowledge and understands complex questions as well as can reason through them to provide relevant answers. The teacher provides the core knowledge and framework. Chatbots then utilise this ""teacher"" (the LLM) to interact with users. The chatbot is the ""student"" or ""interface"" that applies the teacher's lessons.This means AI is really good at specific tasks, like playing chess or giving directions, but it can't do other things beyond its programmed scope.AI is getting deeply integrated into our daily lives, making things easier, faster and smarter. For example, it can be used in powering voice assistants that can answer questions in seconds, or in healthcare where doctors can ask AI to analyse medical images (like X-rays for early disease detection) in seconds and help patients in a more effective manner, or help in drug discovery.It aims to make people efficient by allowing them to delegate some work to AI and helping them in focusing on major problems.At its core, Agentic AI focuses on creating AI agents – intelligent software programmes that can gather information, process it for reasoning, execute the ideas by taking decisions and even learn and adapt by evaluating their outcomes.For example, a chatbot is a script: ""If a customer asks X, reply Y.""A Generative AI (LLM) is like a brilliant essay writer: ""Give it a topic, and it'll write an essay.""Agentic AI is like a project manager: ""My goal is to plan and execute a marketing campaign."" It can then break down the goal, generate ideas, write emails, schedule meetings, analyse data and adjust its plan – all with minimal human oversight – Just like JARVIS in Iron Man and Avengers movies.AGI is a hypothetical form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of intellectual tasks at a level comparable to, or surpassing, that of a human being. Think of AGI as a brilliant human polymath – someone who can master any subject, solve any problem and adapt to any challenge across various fields.While AI agents are created to take up specific tasks in which they learn and execute, AGI will be like a ‘ Super AI Agent ’ that virtually has all the information there is in this world and can solve problems on any subject.There is a straightforward answer by various tech CEOs and executives across the industry: Yes. AI will take away repetitive, predictable tasks and extensive data processing, such as data entry, routine customer service, assembly line operations, basic accounting and certain analytical roles.While this means some existing positions may be displaced, AI will more broadly transform roles, augmenting human capabilities and shifting the focus towards tasks requiring creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence and strategic oversight. For example, AI/Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists , Prompt Engineers and more.The last such revolution came with the internet and computers which did eat some jobs but created so many more roles for people. They can skill themselves by enrolling in new AI-centric courses to learn more about the booming technology to be better placed in the future.","AI is getting deeply integrated into our daily lives, making things easier, faster and smarter.

How ChatGPT maker may be looking at Google to solve its 'melting severs' problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-chatgpt-maker-may-be-looking-at-google-to-solve-its-melting-severs-problem/articleshow/121783716.cms,"OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, is reportedly integrating Google's cloud service to meet its growing computing needs, diversifying beyond Microsoft's Azure Cloud. This deal is a strategic win for Google's cloud unit, providing crucial computing capacity for OpenAI's AI models. Despite ChatGPT's threat to Google's search dominance, both companies are willing to collaborate to address massive computing demands.

What this deal means for OpenAI and Google



ChatGPT-maker OpenAI reportedly plans to integrate Google’s cloud service to fulfill its increasing computing demands. The company’s need for growing AI computing capacity was evident from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ’s tweet in March in which he famously noted the company's ""GPUs are melting"" due to an explosion in Ghibli-style image creation on its popular chatbot. This collaboration essentially brings together two prominent competitors in the AI sector. The agreement, which had been under discussion for several months, was finalised in May, news agency Reuters quoted three sources as saying. It is to be noted that OpenAI has the backing of Microsoft, one of the competitors of Google in the cloud computing space.For OpenAI, the move represents its latest effort to diversify its computing resources beyond its primary backer, Microsoft, and its highly anticipated Stargate data center project. Microsoft is mostly the first cloud provider to offer OpenAI’s AI models through Azure Cloud.For Google's cloud unit, this deal marks a significant win, as it will provide additional computing capacity to OpenAI's existing infrastructure, crucial for both training and running its AI models. The sources also told the news agency that this is a strategic gain for Google.This collaboration is particularly striking given that OpenAI's ChatGPT has emerged as one of the most substantial threats to Google's longstanding dominance in online search in years. Google executives have recently acknowledged that the race for AI leadership may not ultimately be a ""winner-take-all"" scenario.As per Scotiabank analysts, there are growth opportunities for Google's Cloud unit but said that the tech giant needs to be cautious about the competitive pressure posed by ChatGPT on Google's search business.“The deal... underscores the fact that the two are willing to overlook heavy competition between them to meet the massive computing demands. Ultimately, we view this as a big win for Google’s cloud unit, but... there are continued worries that ChatGPT is becoming an incrementally larger threat to Google’s search dominance,” they said.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI reportedly plans to integrate Google’s cloud service to fulfill its increasing computing demands.

Starbucks to use AI to cut wait time and make service faster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/starbucks-to-use-ai-to-cut-wait-time-and-make-service-faster/articleshow/121781077.cms,"Apple's HUGE iPhone makeover: iOS 26 & Liquid Glass Explained!

Starbucks is introducing a new AI assistant called Green Dot Assist at 35 stores this month to help baristas work faster and more efficiently. According to a CNBC report, the assistant is built using Microsoft Azure’s OpenAI platform and is part of the company’s plan to improve service and reduce wait times at its cafés. The AI tool was unveiled during Starbucks’ Leadership Experience event in Las Vegas, where over 14,000 North American store managers gathered. A full rollout across U.S. and Canadian stores is expected in fiscal year 2026, starting this fall.“It’s just another example of how innovation technology is coming into service of our partners and making sure that we’re doing all we can to simplify the operations, make their jobs just a little bit easier, maybe a little bit more fun, so that they can do what they do best,” Starbucks Chief Technology Officer Deb Hall Lefevre told the publication.Helping Baristas work smarterGreen Dot Assist will be available on a tablet behind the counter, allowing baristas to type or speak their questions in plain language. Instead of looking through manuals or online guides, staff can now quickly find answers about drink recipes, fixing equipment, and more.Future plans for the AI include automatically reporting tech issues and suggesting schedule changes when an employee is absent. These upgrades aim to support Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol’s goal of reducing service times to under four minutes per order.Starbucks’ partnership with Microsoft comes at a time when many companies, like Walmart and JPMorgan, are adopting generative AI to improve operations and reduce costs. However, AI tools can sometimes provide wrong answers — a problem known as “hallucinations.” Lefevre said Starbucks’ system is designed with safeguards to ensure the information it gives is accurate.Other upgrades shown at the event included a new point-of-sale system and improved espresso machines. According to Lefevre, even experienced baristas are learning to use the new system in under an hour. It can also suggest repeat orders for loyal customers, helping Starbucks bring back a more personal experience in its stores.","Green Dot Assist will be available on a tablet behind the counter, allowing baristas to type or speak their questions in plain language.

Errol Musk's Stunning Disclosure On Trump-Elon Public Spat | 'In Heat Of The Moment...'

Errol Musk’s on Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s fight

Elon Musk and Donald Trump dispute



The public feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump is not a political falling out, but rather a consequence of prolonged stress and potential ""PTSD from the White House"" on his son's part, according to Errol Musk, Elon's father. Speaking to Russian media in Moscow, the Elon Musk’s father suggested his son made a ""mistake"" by publicly confronting Trump. The relationship between the two high-profile figures, once characterized by mutual admiration and a seemingly strong alliance, has recently dissolved into a bitter public exchange, primarily on social media. The spat intensified after Elon Musk denounced Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a sweeping tax and spending package, calling it a ""disgusting abomination.""

His politics is like a swimming pool with no sides and no bottom,"" Errol stated, offering a candid assessment of his son's public political engagements.The feud began when Elon Musk criticised Trump’s tax and spending bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Trump retaliated by threatening to cut federal contracts with Musk’s companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. Musk then suggested Trump’s name appeared in sealed Jeffrey Epstein files, further escalating tensions.","Errol Musk, Elon Musk's father, said his son made a ""mistake"" by publicly confronting Donald Trump.

License of Zepto’s Dharavi facility suspended

Smart AC Hacks to Cut Your Electricity Bill & Make It Last Longer!

Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended the food business licence of Blinkit ’s dark store in Pune’s Balewadi area. According to a report by Economic Times, the FDA conducted an investigation on June 5 and found that the dark store was operating without the required approvals from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Operated by M/s Energy Darkstore Services near Mitcon College, the facility was found storing and selling food items without obtaining the mandatory licence under Section 31(1) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.The licence will remain suspended until proper authorisation is secured.As per the report, officials also cited multiple food safety violations at the site. The inspection report flagged issues such as food placed directly on the floor, lack of pest control certification, workers without protective gear, dusty storage racks, and a cold storage unit missing a calibration certificate.This action is part of a broader crackdown by authorities on quick commerce “dark stores” amid rising concerns about food hygiene and safety.Earlier this month, Maharashtra’s FDA cancelled the food business licence of Zepto’s Dharavi facility after an inspection revealed multiple hygiene and food safety norms violations. The inspection uncovered fungal growth on some food items, storage near stagnant water, unclean and wet floors, and cold storage units that failed to maintain the necessary temperature. Officials also found expired food products that were not separated from fresh stock.“The inspection at the Dharavi location revealed poor hygiene and unsafe food storage conditions,” said FDA officials.Following these findings, Assistant Commissioner of Food, Anupamaa Balasaheb Patil, ordered the cancellation of the facility’s licence under Section 32(3) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.",Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended the food business licence of Blinkit ’s dark store in Pune.

[4K] Xbox Games Showcase 2025 | The Outer Worlds 2 & Grounded 2 Direct

Microsoft just wrapped up their biggest gaming showcase of the year, and honestly? They came loaded for bear. From brand new handhelds to surprise Final Fantasy drops, this wasn't your typical ""here's what's coming eventually"" presentation. The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.The show's theme was clear: Xbox wants to be everywhere you are, whether that's your couch, your desk, or apparently now in your backpack. With every announced game supporting Xbox Play Anywhere and a shiny new handheld to show off, Microsoft is doubling down on their ""play anywhere"" philosophy in a big way.Let's break down everything that happened during this gaming extravaganza.The biggest hardware surprise came courtesy of Microsoft's partnership with Asus. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X aren't just another Steam Deck competitor, they’re Microsoft's direct answer to handheld PC gaming. Both the Ally(s) run full Windows, meaning you can access Xbox Game Pass, Steam, Battle.net, and pretty much any PC storefront you can think of.The regular Ally packs an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, while the Ally X steps things up with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme, 24GB of RAM, and a full terabyte of storage. Both launch this holiday season, and Microsoft made sure to mention that every game shown in the showcase will run on these handhelds. That's a bold claim, but if it holds true, these could be game-changers for portable gaming.After years of waiting, Obsidian's space RPG sequel has locked in October 29, 2025 as its launch date. The new trailer showed off the colony of Arcadia, which looks like it's having a significantly worse time than the locations in the first game. Rifts are tearing through space-time, factions are at each other's throats, and somehow capitalism is still the real villain.The sequel promises bigger RPG systems, more reactive storytelling, and full character customisation. Plus, there's an expanded Direct happening right after the showcase, so Obsidian clearly has a lot more to show. If you enjoyed the original's blend of dark humour and corporate satire, this looks like more of exactly what you want.October 21, 2025 marks the return of one of gaming's most brutally difficult action series. Ninja Gaiden 4 is a collaboration between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, which sounds like a recipe for some absolutely bonkers combat sequences. The trailer showcased new protagonist Yakumo pulling off impossible combos against hordes of enemies, with the signature weapon-switching and aerial juggling the series is known for.The game is set in near-future Tokyo, features connections to series legend Ryu Hayabusa, and promises to deliver that ""git gud or go home"" difficulty the franchise built its reputation on. If you've been missing proper character action games, this one's shaping up to be essential.Sometimes the most unexpected announcements hit the hardest, and Super Meat Boy 3D definitely qualifies. Sluggerfly and Headup Games are taking Team Meat's masochistic masterpiece and literally adding another dimension to the suffering. The early 2026 release promises all the wall-jumping, buzzsaw-dodging, death-filled gameplay that made the original a cult classic, except now you can fail spectacularly in three dimensions instead of two.The trailer showcased the same tight platforming mechanics that turned controllers into projectiles worldwide, complete with Meat Boy's quest to rescue his bandage-wrapped girlfriend from that eternally creepy fetus in a jar. It's the kind of game that makes you question your life choices while simultaneously hitting ""retry"" for the 500th time – and honestly, we wouldn't have it any other way.InXile's ambitious RPG got an extended look, and it's looking appropriately ambitious. Set in the steampunk city of Avalon, players discover that history itself has been manipulated by the city's ruler. Your solution? A time travel device that lets you hop into the past and change things, with consequences rippling forward into the present.The new trailer focused on the grittier side of Avalon, showing the downtrodden areas where gangs prey on the weak. It's a far cry from the polished upper city areas we've seen before, suggesting the game will have some real social commentary alongside its time-bending mechanics. No release date yet, but this is definitely one to watch.The final reveal of the show was perhaps the biggest surprise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, set in 2035. This isn't your typical modern warfare setup; the trailer suggested heavy sci-fi elements, psychological warfare, and the return of David Mason from Black Ops 2. The year 2035 apparently isn't going great for humanity, with the world ""on the brink of chaos"" following the events of previous Black Ops games.Treyarch and Raven Software are promising co-op campaign support, near-future weaponry, and the next chapter of Round-Based Zombies. The official reveal is coming this summer, but this teaser suggests the series is taking some big swings with its setting and tone.Sometimes the best announcements are the ones you can play immediately. Gears of War: Reloaded launches August 26, but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can jump into a multiplayer beta starting June 13. This definitive edition of the original Gears features 4K textures, 60 FPS campaign, 120 FPS multiplayer, and full cross-play support.The remaster is coming to more platforms than any Gears game before it, including PlayStation 5. It's a smart move from Microsoft, using one of their biggest exclusives to showcase their multi-platform strategy while giving longtime fans the definitive way to experience the game that started it all.Obsidian's surprise sequel announcement came with an immediate Early Access date, July 29, 2025. Grounded 2 moves the action from a single backyard to the larger Brookhollow Park, featuring new biomes, new bugs, and one of the community's most requested features: rideable vehicles called Buggies.The game promises major quality-of-life improvements over the original, including an all-in-one Omni-Tool that should streamline the building and crafting systems. With over 25 million players shaping the first game's development, this sequel feels like a direct response to community feedback.In the showcase's biggest surprise drop, Final Fantasy XVI is available on Xbox platforms right now. Not tomorrow, not next week, today. The game that many considered a permanent PlayStation exclusive just became part of Xbox's catalog, complete with Xbox Play Anywhere support and cross-save functionality.Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is following this winter, meaning Xbox players will soon have access to some of the most acclaimed JRPGs of recent years. Microsoft made sure to point out that every mainline single-player Final Fantasy is now playable on Xbox platforms, which is a pretty impressive collection to have.Three RPGs caught attention for their unique approaches to familiar genres. Aniimo is an open-world creature collecting game that lets players actually transform into the creatures they capture through something called the Twining system. It's hitting 2026 with a closed beta coming later this year.Aphelion from Don't Nod (Life is Strange, Jusant) is a sci-fi adventure about an astronaut stranded on a frozen planet. What makes it special is its partnership with the European Space Agency, promising gameplay grounded in real science. Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak takes players to post-apocalyptic Japan with a cursed protagonist and her loyal dog companion fighting massive creatures.All three games are coming in 2026.Quarter Up announced Invincible VS , a 3v3 tag fighter based on the hit comic and animated series. The trailer showed appropriately brutal superhero combat with characters like Mark, Thula, and Atom Eve beating the absolute stuffing out of each other. It's coming in 2026 and looks like it could scratch that Marvel vs. Capcom itch.Mudang: Two Hearts is a tactical action game set in a reunified Korea, following a North Korean operative and a K-pop idol whose paths cross during terrorist attacks. The cinematic presentation and Unreal Engine 5 visuals make it one to watch for 2026.Persona 4 Revival got the briefest of teases, literally about seven seconds of footage, but it's enough to confirm that Atlus is giving the beloved JRPG a full remake treatment. No release date yet, but seeing those updated visuals of Inaba was enough to get fans excited.Three major Xbox exclusives are getting substantial content drops. The Elder Scrolls Online is continuing its Worm Cult storyline with new content arriving June 18. Fallout 76 added fishing with the Gone Fission update, because apparently even post-apocalyptic wasteland dwellers need to relax sometimes.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting The Order of Giants DLC on September 4, taking Indy beneath the streets of Rome for a new adventure.The most anticipated indie game of the decade got its briefest of mentions, but sometimes that's all you need to send a fanbase into overdrive. Hollow Knight: Silksong appeared during the ROG Xbox Ally segment with a simple promise: it'll be available ""at launch and in Game Pass"" when the handheld arrives later this year. No new footage, no release date, just the confirmation that Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel is still breathing.The game's developer quickly clarified that Silksong isn't tied to the console's release and will arrive ""before Holiday,"" which has fans cautiously optimistic that Christmas 2025 might finally deliver the Metroidvania sequel they've been waiting years for. After countless delays and radio silence, even this tiny update feels like a victory for the Silksong faithful who've been subsisting on hope and memes for far too long.Phil Spencer closed the show by looking ahead to 2026 and Xbox's 25th anniversary. The confirmed lineup includes a new Fable, the next Forza game, Gears of War: E-Day, and what Spencer called ""the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning."" Most fans are interpreting that last tease as Halo-related, possibly a Combat Evolved remake or remaster.It's a strong lineup for Xbox's quarter-century celebration, mixing beloved franchises with what sounds like a major nostalgic announcement. Whether it's Halo or something else entirely, Spencer clearly saved the biggest tease for last.","The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.

HP EliteBook Ultra G1i Review: Thin, light, power in a premium package

Deloitte is letting its US employees spend part of their annual wellness subsidy on Lego sets, puzzles, and other stress-relieving items. According to a Business Insider, the action is part of a revamped effort by the company to support worker well-being. According to internal policy documents seen by the publication, the Big Four consulting firm updated its long-running benefits program at the start of its financial year on June 1. The program gives most salaried employees up to $1,000 annually to spend on approved items that promote mental, physical, or financial wellness, the report says. Legos, along with puzzles, kitchen appliances, spa services, gaming consoles, and ergonomic pillows, are among the new additions.Deloitte US had 172,800 employees in 2024. As per the report, employees have welcomed the change. A Deloitte employee said that the update sparked jokes and excitement on internal chats. “Most of the responses are things like ‘Lego?!?!? Finally!’ or jokes about how they can now rationalise buying the coveted Millennium Falcon Star Wars Lego set,” they said. The $850 set leaves a small remainder of the subsidy for other qualifying purchases.Another employee said the benefit helps manage the intense pace of work: “Knocking out a four-hour Lego build in under two hours is a great stress reliever.”However, not all employees are happy with it. Some Deloitte employees remain skeptical. One staffer told BI the perk exists “because of how much this job sucks.”The updated program comes as Deloitte’s US division faces challenges, particularly in its government consulting arm. By April 2025, at least 127 federal contracts had been modified or canceled following the White House’s push to cut spending. Deloitte Consulting CEO Jason Salzetti later confirmed that a “small percentage” of employees in the government division would be laid off.","The Big Four consulting firm updated its long-running benefits program at the start of its financial year on June 1.

What went wrong with Siri: Apple's Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak explain why the ‘new’ Siri ‘just don’t work’ like an Apple product,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-went-wrong-with-siri-apples-craig-federighi-and-greg-joswiak-explain-why-the-new-siri-just-dont-work-like-an-apple-product/articleshow/121775527.cms,"Apple's quality standards override deadlines

Two architectures, one solution

Apple's different AI strategy

Apple's software chief Craig Federighi has offered the most detailed explanation yet for why the company's highly anticipated AI-powered Siri features, first promised at WWDC 2024, have been delayed until 2026. In a series of post-keynote interviews, Federighi admitted that Apple's initial approach ""just doesn't work reliably enough to be an Apple product.""The delay represents a rare misstep for Apple, which typically avoids demonstrating features it cannot deliver on schedule. Federighi revealed that while Apple had working prototypes of the enhanced Siri capabilities, including personal context awareness and cross-app functionality, the features only performed correctly about two-thirds of the time.""This just doesn't work reliably enough to be an Apple product,"" Federighi told The Wall Street Journal, providing his most candid assessment of the situation. In the same WSJ interview, he reiterated the technical challenges: ""We found that when we were developing this feature that we had, really, two phases, two versions of the ultimate architecture that we were going to create.""Speaking to TechRadar and Tom's Guide in a joint podcast interview, Federighi expanded on the architectural problems: ""We realized that V1 architecture, we could push and push and put in more time, but if we tried to push that out in the state it was going to be in, it would not meet our customer expectations or Apple standards.""The admission marks an unusual moment of transparency from Apple, which has faced mounting pressure to compete with AI-powered assistants from Google and OpenAI . Federighi stressed that the company prioritized product quality over meeting artificial deadlines, even as competitors advance their AI capabilities.""Look, we don't want to disappoint customers,"" said Greg Joswiak , Apple's marketing chief, in the Wall Street Journal interview. ""We never do. But it would've been more disappointing to ship something that didn't hit our quality standard, that had an error rate that we felt was unacceptable. So we made what we thought was the best decision. I'd make it again.""Federighi echoed this sentiment in his conversation with YouTuber iJustine , explaining: ""What we said a while ago was that we were really working hard to get those [features] to come together. [We] had them working internally, but not working well enough."" He emphasized the critical importance of reliability: ""You know, when you have an experience like asking Siri to do something, either it becomes something you can depend on reliably, or it's something in the end you're not going to use.""The delayed features were meant to transform Siri into a more capable assistant that could understand personal context, operate across multiple apps, and perform complex tasks based on on-screen content. Apple demonstrated these capabilities at WWDC 2024, showing Siri finding podcasts mentioned in messages and taking actions within apps using what Apple calls ""app intents.""However, Federighi revealed that Apple was simultaneously developing two different underlying architectures. While the company successfully demonstrated the ""V1 architecture"" at last year's conference, it became clear during development that this approach had fundamental limitations that prevented it from meeting Apple's reliability standards.""We were very focused on creating a broad platform for really integrated personal experiences into the OS,"" Federighi saud in the podcast, explaining Apple's original vision. But as development progressed, he noted: ""We set about for months, making it work better and better across more app intents, better and better for doing search, but fundamentally, we found that the limitations of the V1 architecture weren't getting us to the quality level that we knew our customers needed and expected.""In the Wall Street Journal interview, Federighi addressed why Apple, with all its resources, couldn't make the original approach work: ""When it comes to automating capabilities on devices in a reliable way, no one's doing it really well right now. We wanted to be the first. We wanted to do it best.""""We set about for months, making it work better and better across more app intents, better and better for doing search,"" Federighi said. ""But fundamentally, we found that the limitations of the V1 architecture weren't getting us to the quality level that we knew our customers needed and expected.""The switch to what Federighi calls the ""V2 architecture"" effectively reset the development timeline. This deeper, more comprehensive approach extends across the entire Siri experience, building upon the work already completed rather than starting from scratch.""The V2 architecture is not, it wasn't a start-over,"" Federighi clarified in his TechRadar-Tom's Guide interview. ""The V1 architecture was sort of half of the V2 architecture, and now we extend it across, sort of make it a pure architecture that extends across the entire Siri experience.""During the company's spring assessment, Apple made the difficult decision to abandon the V1 approach. ""As soon as we realized that, and that was during the spring, we let the world know that we weren't going to be able to put that out, and we were going to keep working on really shifting to the new architecture,"" Federighi told the podcast.Apple's approach differs significantly from competitors like OpenAI and Google, who have released chatbot-style AI assistants that users access through dedicated apps. Instead, Apple aims to integrate intelligence throughout its ecosystem, meeting users ""where they are"" rather than requiring them to navigate to a separate AI interface.""When we started with Apple Intelligence, we were very clear: this wasn't about just building a chatbot,"" Federighi emphasized in the podcast. The company's strategy remains focused on embedding AI capabilities directly into existing apps and workflows, rather than creating a standalone conversational assistant.Joswiak reinforced this philosophy in the same podcast discussion: ""The features that you're seeing in Apple Intelligence isn't a destination for us. There's no app on intelligence. [It's about] making all the things you do every day better.""Federighi acknowledged the appeal of conversational AI but maintained Apple's different focus: ""I know a lot of people find it to be a really powerful way to gather their thoughts, brainstorm [...] So, sure, these are great things. Are they the most important thing for Apple to develop? Well, time will tell where we go there, but that's not the main thing we set out to do at this time.""While Apple won't commit to a specific timeline for the enhanced Siri features, Federighi made clear the company won't repeat its premature announcement mistake. ""We will announce the date when we're ready to seed it, and you're all ready to be able to experience it,"" he told the TechRadar-Tom's Guide podcast.Speaking with YouTuber iJustine, Federighi promised comprehensive delivery: ""We really look forward to releasing everything we talked about in the past, and more. We don't really want to commit to that until we have it in hand."" This suggests Apple may have additional Siri capabilities in development beyond what was originally demonstrated at WWDC 2024.","Apple's software chief Craig Federighi reveals Siri features will be delayed until 2026.

People focus on wrong thing in meetings: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon

Apple's HUGE iPhone makeover: iOS 26 & Liquid Glass Explained!

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Morgan has criticized corporate meetings , terming them as “breeding grounds” for corporate politics and inefficiency, reports Business Insider. Speaking at a Morgan Stanley financial conference , Dimon advised corporate managers to abandon meetings “run for the boss”. Instead, managers should be completely open and honest about problems in the business, he said.During the event, Dimon emphasised that managers should be more open about problems instead of hiding them. He said teams should “put your dead cats on the table” — a phrase he used to stress the need for honest discussions about operational issues, according to the publication.Quoting a conversation he had at lunch, Dimon said a participant told him: 'We don't have any dead cats. We have a few wounded ones.'"" To this Dimon replied: ""'Go put the wounded ones on the table.'""Explaining why people focus on the wrong thing in meetings, Jamie said that the reason is that they're fighting for resources — ""for the credit of revenues and expenses and one set of books.""""People don't allocate properly, they're not honest about their loss leaders, they give credit to parts of the company that don't deserve credit,"" he said.Giving another example, Dimon pointed to JPMorgan’s small business credit card division as an example, noting it competes with American Express despite being “one-third of the size.” Dimon said, “If you were running that business, I’d be asking you, ‘What are they doing better?’”He continued: “I’m fanatic about, ‘Are you doing your marketing?’ Or ‘What’s the ROI?

The agency predicts that even if demand decreases, companies will raise prices, particularly impacting the 45% of PC sales and the majority of smartphone sales driven by consumers.‘We expect PC and phone makers will pass on the higher cost to customers even if it leads to some demand destruction, especially for consumers who make up 45 per cent of PC sales and most of smartphone sales,’ the global credit ratings agency said in a research note, seen by ETTelecom. It noted that smartphone makers, such as Apple and its key suppliers, and personal computer (PC) manufacturers heavily reliant on China, are the most vulnerable to the US tariffs.The note added: ‘S&P Global Ratings believes the most vulnerable companies are those with the largest reliance on China's integrated technology production infrastructure and the U.S. as a major end market.’ In particular, it said Apple and its key suppliers, including Hon Hai Precision Industry (Foxconn), may be the most disrupted due to reliance on China for production.Companies heavily reliant on China for production, such as Apple and its key suppliers like Foxconn, are the most vulnerable to the tariffs. Apple, holding over 60% of the US smartphone market as of Q4 2024, faces significant risk due to its China-based production, with iPhones accounting for nearly 50% of its revenue. The US represents about a third of Apple’s global smartphone shipments. Similarly, PC makers Dell, HP , and Lenovo face risks due to high input costs and reliance on Chinese manufacturing for laptops, with US PC sales contributing 15-20% of their operating profits.While Apple is shifting iPhone production to India, expected to cover most US-bound shipments by 2026, and Samsung relies on Vietnam and India for production, both companies remain exposed to potential tariff increases. The Trump administration has imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, including India, with China imposing reciprocal tariffs. Although consumer electronics like smartphones and laptops are currently exempt, President Trump has threatened a 25% tariff on smartphones made outside the US, targeting brands like Apple and Samsung.S&P notes that Xiaomi, with no direct US market exposure and chip production in Taiwan, is less affected by US tariffs or China’s retaliatory measures. Meanwhile, the International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts global smartphone shipments to grow by only 0.6% in 2025, down from a 2.3% projection, citing tariff-related uncertainties. India and Vietnam remain key alternatives to China for smartphone production, but additional 20-30% tariffs could disrupt the US market outlook.For PCs, Dell has shifted US-bound production outside China, and HP is expected to follow by June 2025. However, S&P cautions that moving assembly to the US won’t fully mitigate tariff risks unless critical components like processors and display panels from Taiwan, South Korea, and China are exempted.","The agency predicts that even if demand decreases, companies will raise prices, particularly impacting the 45% of PC sales and the majority of smartphone sales driven by consumers.

In 2016, he bought a neighboring 4.5-acre estate for $13.5 million.

He then snapped up two vacant lots for around $5 million.

Another 5.2-acre compound with barns and residential buildings was acquired for $8.7 million.

Finally, a 1.3-acre plot was purchased for $2.5 million to complete the puzzle.

The Bill Gates’ approach to parenting

“We absolutely did not just buy them things. It was much more of an upbringing like I grew up in. A very middle-class household where money did dictate whether I got an extra pair of shoes that year or not.”

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Billionaire founder joins theMark Zuckerberg’s mission

The ultimate AI arms race

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is personally recruiting a 50-person ""superintelligence"" team with compensation packages reaching nine figures, as the tech giant races to achieve AI that surpasses human intelligence. Bloomberg reports that Zuckerberg has been meeting with top AI researchers and engineers at his Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto homes, offering seven- to nine-figure pay deals to lure talent from competitors like OpenAI and Google.The Facebook founder has rearranged desks at Meta's Menlo Park headquarters so new team members will sit near him, signaling his hands-on approach to what he considers Meta's most critical initiative. Some researchers have already accepted these unprecedented compensation offers, according to sources familiar with the recruitment drive.The team's marquee recruit is expected to be Alexandr Wang , the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, whose company is valued at $28 billion. Meta is negotiating a multi-billion dollar investment in Scale AI that would represent the social media giant's largest external investment to date, with Wang and other Scale AI employees joining the superintelligence unit after the deal closes.Zuckerberg's aggressive recruitment push stems from frustration over Meta's recent AI setbacks, particularly the disappointing reception of Llama 4 , the company's latest large language model released in April, Bloomberg reported.The initiative reflects the intensifying competition among tech giants to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) and eventually superintelligence—AI systems that exceed human capabilities across all tasks. While companies like OpenAI and Google pursue similar goals, Zuckerberg believes Meta's strong advertising revenue gives it a funding advantage over rivals dependent on external investment rounds.The CEO has told potential recruits that Meta's cash flow could support building multi-gigawatt data centers, potentially creating one of the world's most powerful server infrastructures for AI development.","Mark Zuckerberg is personally recruiting a 50-person ""superintelligence"" team with compensation packages reaching nine figures.

The Senegalese Italian TikTok sensation and one of the most-followed influencers globally was detained in Las Vegas for allegedly overstaying his visa. The 25-year-old arrived in the US on April 30 and was held at Harry Reid International Airport on Friday, according to an ICE spokesperson. Although detained, Lame was not issued a deportation order. Instead, he voluntarily left the country, an option that allows individuals to exit without a formal deportation mark on their immigration records. This could be crucial in avoiding long-term re-entry bans, which can stretch up to 10 years.Lame's detainment comes in the middle of US President Donald Trump's intensifying clampdown on immigration, which has triggered protests across major US cities. Recent US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles, combined with the controversial deployment of the National Guard, have reignited debates over the administration’s use of executive power. In California, tensions escalated as tear gas and flash-bangs were used on demonstrators outside federal buildings. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned Trump’s actions, calling them “unconstitutional” and vowing to challenge the federal government in court.Just weeks ago, Lame walked the red carpet at the Met Gala in New York City, one of the fashion world’s biggest events. His visit to the US, however, was unexpectedly cut short due to his visa situation. While his exit from the country was amicable and without legal penalties, the incident highlights growing concerns around immigration enforcement and how even international celebrities can get caught in the crossfire of broader political battles.According to the reports, Lame has not publicly commented on the incident, but his team is expected to clarify his future travel plans soon. Whether he will return to the US in the near future remains uncertain, especially given the increasing scrutiny at borders under the Trump administration’s renewed immigration agenda.Born in Senegal and raised in Chivasso, Italy, Khaby Lame shot to fame during the COVID-19 lockdowns. After losing his factory job in 2020, he began posting videos silently mocking over-engineered life hacks. His expressive, wordless reactions quickly resonated with millions, propelling him to stardom.According to the reports, Khaby lame has more than 160 million followers on TikTok, Lame is now the platform’s most-followed creator. His meteoric rise has led to major brand collaborations including a long-term deal with Hugo Boss and prestigious accolades.

When software outpaces the hardware

The 20th anniversary iPhone: Where hardware meets Liquid Glass vision

It’s beyond mere aesthetics

There's something different about Apple 's new Liquid Glass design language in iOS 26 . While the translucent, fluid interface elements are undeniably beautiful, with their specular highlights and dynamic reflections, they feel strangely at odds with the flat, angular hardware they're meant to inhabit.The shift represents the company's third major design evolution since the original iPhone , moving from the real-world mimicry of skeuomorphism to the simplified geometry of flat design, and now to something entirely new. hat comes 12 years after the last major change, when Apple shifted from skeuomorphism to flat design in 2013.But, the current generation of iPhones, with their crisp edges and matte finishes, seems to clash with software that's all about curves, transparency, and organic flow.This disconnect isn't accidental. If anything, it's a preview of where Apple is heading, both in design philosophy and hardware evolution. The Liquid Glass interface feels like it belongs on a device that doesn't exist yet, one that matches its fluid aesthetic with equally fluid form factors. That device, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, is likely coming sooner than we think.Apple's design history is punctuated by moments when software vision preceded hardware capability. The original iPhone's skeuomorphic interface helped users transition from physical to digital interactions, while iOS 7's flat design coincided with the introduction of the Apple Watch and larger iPhone displays. Now, Liquid Glass appears to be setting the stage for another hardware change for Apple.The new design language, announced at WWDC 2025, extends across all of Apple's platforms, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26. It features translucent materials that ""reflect and refract their surroundings"" while ""dynamically transforming to help bring greater focus to content.""Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of Human Interface Design, described Liquid Glass as combining ""the optical qualities of glass with a fluidity only Apple can achieve."" The emphasis on real-time rendering and dynamic reactions to movement suggests Apple is preparing users for devices that are themselves more glass-like, more fluid in their physical construction.This hardware-software makes sense when viewed through the lens of Apple's development cycles, as they have repeatedly used interface design to telegraph future. Major interface overhauls typically precede significant hardware launches by 12 to 18 months, giving developers time to adapt and users time to acclimate for transitions that might otherwise feel jarring.The introduction of Dark Mode years before OLED displays became standard across the iPhone lineup is one example; the emphasis on curved corners in iOS design elements before the iPhone X's curved display is another. Looking back, the tinted icons and customization options Apple introduced last year were early hints of the Liquid Glass design language to come.Gurman's reporting reveals why Liquid Glass feels premature on current hardware: it's designed for the 2027 iPhone, internally codenamed ""Glasswing"" after the butterfly species with transparent wings. This 20th anniversary device promises to embody the Liquid Glass aesthetic in physical form, featuring ""curved glass sides around the entire phone, even at the edges"" with ""extraordinarily slim bezels and no cutout section in the screen.""The Glasswing concept suggests Apple is returning to the design language of the iPhone X, that pivotal 2017 device that introduced edge-to-edge displays and curved corners. The iPhone X felt revolutionary precisely because its hardware matched its software: the curved display corners perfectly complemented the rounded interface elements, while the all-glass construction reflected the translucent design elements on screen.Current iPhones, despite their technical prowess, lack this harmony. The flat edges introduced with the iPhone 12 series, while premium and distinctive, create a visual tension with Liquid Glass's organic curves and flowing animations. It's elegant software trapped in geometric hardware.Liquid Glass isn't just about visual appeal, it's a show of Apple's advancing graphics capabilities and silicon performance. The real-time rendering and dynamic light effects require considerable computational power, indicating Apple's chips can handle more sophisticated visual processing than current interfaces utilise.This technological capability is important for the Glasswing iPhone 's implementation. A device with curved glass surfaces and minimal bezels will need software that can adapt to different viewing angles and lighting conditions. Liquid Glass's emphasis on environmental adaptation, how interface elements respond to surrounding content and lighting, resembles a feature set for a phone designed to be viewed from multiple angles.The implications extend beyond phones. Apple's focus on cross-platform design consistency suggests Liquid Glass will influence products from the Apple Watch to future AR/VR devices. A design language built around transparency and environmental awareness appears well-suited for mixed reality applications, where virtual interfaces must integrate with physical environments.As Apple prepares to introduce iOS 26's Liquid Glass interface, users will experience a design philosophy that feels ahead of current hardware. This appears intentional. By the time the 20th anniversary iPhone arrives in 2027, Liquid Glass may feel less 'revolutionary' and more like a natural evolution of a design language that finally has appropriate hardware to support its vision.","Liquid Glass is Apple's new design language for iOS 26.

Microsoft may sign one of the biggest deals yet for its AI-powered CoPilot assistant: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-may-sign-one-of-the-biggest-deals-yet-for-its-ai-powered-copilot-assistant-report/articleshow/121776384.cms,"Microsoft is reportedly nearing a massive deal to integrate its AI-powered Copilot assistant with a single customer boasting over a million Microsoft 365 licenses. While the customer's identity remains undisclosed, speculation points to a potential shift towards consumption-based billing, deviating from the standard per-user monthly pricing model.

Likely partners of rumoured Microsoft’s deal

Apple's HUGE iPhone makeover: iOS 26 & Liquid Glass Explained!

Microsoft is reportedly working on one of the biggest deals yet for its AI-powered CoPilot assistant. According to a Business Insider report, the software giant’s Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff told employees that a single customer with more than 1 million Microsoft 365 licenses will soon be adding Copilot to its setup.The report further says that the agreement could still change, and Microsoft might not follow its usual per-user monthly pricing. Instead, the company could try consumption-based billing, a new trend in AI-related services.If Microsoft were to charge its standard $30 per user per month for Copilot, the deal could be worth around $360 million a year. However, it's unlikely that a customer buying in such volume would pay full price.Adding over a million users in one go would be a big boost for Microsoft’s efforts to expand Copilot’s adoption. While the company has heavily invested in AI tools, it’s still working out how to best market and price them. Some customers and insiders have questioned Copilot’s effectiveness and Microsoft’s evolving AI strategy.To address this, Microsoft has recently updated how it presents its AI offerings to customers, aiming to simplify the pitch and boost adoption, internal documents show.While the identity of the customer remains unknown, but “there aren't many companies with workforces that size,” the report states. Amazon is one possible candidate, given its size. But a company employee told Business Insider that Amazon is unlikely to adopt Copilot due to internal rules against using external AI tools. Amazon also declined to comment.A previous report by the publication quoted an internal memo which said that Amazon employees will migrate to Microsoft's cloud applications on a ""rolling basis"".","Microsoft is reportedly working on one of the biggest deals yet for its AI- powered CoPilot assistant.

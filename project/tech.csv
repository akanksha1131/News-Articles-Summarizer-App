ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s sister accuses him of sexual abuse; family responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-sister-accuses-him-of-sexual-abuse-family-responds/articleshow/117038723.cms,"Here’s the statement issued by Sam Altman and family

Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being. Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult. We know many families facing similar struggles understand this well.

Over the years, we've tried in many ways to support Annie and help her find stability, following professional advice on how to be supportive without enabling harmful behaviors. To give a sense of our efforts, we have given her monthly financial support, directly paid her bills, covered her rent, helped her find employment opportunities, attempted to get her medical help, and have offered to buy her a house through a trust (so that she would have a secure place to live, but not be able to sell it immediately). Via our late father's estate, Annie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life.

Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us. In this vein, Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. We've chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this.

Over the years, she has accused members of our family of improperly withholding our father's 401k funds, hacking her wife, and ""shadowbanning"" her from various websites including ChatGPT, Twitter, and more. The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child (she has also claimed instances of sexual abuse from others). Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.

All of these claims are utterly untrue. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.

We ask for understanding and compassion from everyone as we continue to support Annie in the best way we can. We sincerely hope she finds the stability and peace she's been searching for.

The lawsuit, filed on Monday, claims the abuse began when she was just 3 years old and continued until she was still a minor, even after Sam Altman had become an adult. Ann Altman has previously made similar allegations against her brother on social media.In response, Sam Altman, 39, issued a statement on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday, on behalf of himself, his mother, and his brothers, calling the allegations “deeply hurtful and utterly untrue.” The post is captioned “My sister has filed a lawsuit against me.

The UK government has announced that it will criminalise the creation and sharing of sexually explicit deepfake images . The government will also introduce a new rule under which perpetrators will be charged for both creating and sharing these images. The move aims to strengthen protections for women and girls against image-based abuse.“Predators who create sexually explicit ‘deepfakes’ could face prosecution as the Government bears down on vile online abuse as part of its mission to make our streets safer,” the government said, adding, “The proliferation of these hyper-realistic images has grown at an alarming rate, causing devastating harm to victims, particularly women and girls who are often the target.”The proposed legislation will make it a criminal offense to create deepfakes without consent, punishable by up to two years in prison. This move closes a gap in existing laws, which currently only criminalise the sharing or threat of sharing intimate images, including deepfakes.The UK government will also create new offences for the taking of intimate images without consent and the installation of equipment with intent to commit these offences.Victims Minister Alex Davies-Jones emphasised the urgency of addressing this issue, citing that one in three women in the UK have been victims of online abuse.“This demeaning and disgusting form of chauvinism must not become normalised, and as part of our Plan for Change we are bearing down on violence against women – whatever form it takes. These new offences will help prevent people being victimised online. We are putting offenders on notice – they will face the full force of the law,” said Davies-Jones.These new offences follow the UK government’s action in September 2024 to add sharing intimate image offences as priority offences under the Online Safety Act.","The UK government has announced that it will criminalise the creation and sharing of sexually explicit deepfake images.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?



Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Here’s what Suchir Balaji's mother wrote

Update on @suchirbalaji

We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death. Private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.

Suchir’s apartment was ransacked , sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.

It’s a cold blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide.

Mother of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI , is requesting help from Elon Musk following her son's death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month. His mother posted on social media, tagging Musk and asking for an FBI investigation . Police stated, “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

CES 2025: This electric spoon makes boring food taste salty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ces-2025-this-electric-spoon-makes-boring-food-taste-salty/articleshow/117027841.cms,"Japanese company, Kirin has introduced an electric spoon at CES 2025 that makes low-sodium food taste saltier without adding any actual salt, marking a potential breakthrough in reducing sodium consumption.The Electric Salt Spoon, which creates a saltier taste sensation through mild electrical stimulation, is currently available in Japan for approximately $127. The device aims to help people reduce their sodium intake while maintaining the familiar salty flavor in their food.Kirin developed the spoon primarily for the Japanese market, where adults consume more than double the World Health Organization's recommended daily sodium intake.The technology behind the spoon has scientific backing - it won the 2023 Ig Nobel prize, an award for unusual scientific research. The original research, published in 2011, demonstrated how weak electrical currents could enhance the perception of saltiness in food.The spoon features four intensity settings and operates by sending a weak electrical current through the food to concentrate sodium ions on the user's tongue. A light indicator on the handle turns from blue to white when the device is properly activated, requiring a specific grip to complete the electrical circuit.While it does sounds fascinating that you could make your food taste saltier, the device can only mimic the taste of salt, you'll need to add all the other spices and flavours to food yourself. other spices or flavours can be added . It works the best with liquids like soups and sauces, and the food needs to have some salt for the effect to work. And, you need to wash the spoon by hand.","The Electric Salt Spoon creates a saltier taste sensation through mild electrical stimulation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) took center stage in 2024, with its rapid evolution sparking debates about its potential to reshape industries and daily life. As we step into 2025, leading voices in the tech industry are predicting the next wave of AI innovations. These forecasts encompass its impact on workplaces, consumer behavior, and societal values. While AI promises increased efficiency and transformation, concerns surrounding job displacement, ethical considerations, and resistance are growing. Here are predictions and insights from prominent tech leaders, offering a comprehensive view of AI’s trajectory in 2025.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, envisions 2025 as the year when AI agents become an integral part of the workforce. He emphasizes the role of agentic AI, which relies on generative AI (GenAI) to function as ""digital coworkers.""Altman predicts these AI agents will materially enhance productivity across industries by automating repetitive tasks and augmenting human capabilities. In a recent blog post, he stated, “We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes.”However, Altman acknowledges the growing concerns about job security as AI becomes mainstream. Businesses adopting this technology must balance innovation with strategies to ensure workforce sustainability and skill development.Bill Gates has long advocated for the importance of education in adapting to technological advancements. He has repeatedly stated that by 2025, two-thirds of all U.S. jobs will require education beyond high school.This prediction underscores the need for upskilling in an AI-driven economy. As AI tools become integral to various roles, individuals and organizations must prioritize education and training to remain competitive. Gates’ vision aligns with the broader trend of integrating AI into workplaces, highlighting the importance of lifelong learning in an evolving job market.Werner Vogels, Amazon’s Chief Technology Officer, emphasizes the cultural shifts driven by technology. He predicts a ""quiet revolution"" in 2025, where workers, particularly Millennials and Gen Zers, prioritize purpose over financial success.In a December blog post, Vogels noted that people are increasingly seeking roles that contribute positively to society. “Harnessing technology for good has become both an ethical imperative and a profitable endeavor,” Vogels stated.He also highlighted the growing awareness of the mental health implications of technology, particularly among younger generations. Vogels predicts that 2025 will see a rise in alternative technologies, such as simplified “dumb phones,” as consumers seek to redefine their relationship with digital tools.Clement Delangue, CEO of AI startup Hugging Face, anticipates a more confrontational approach to AI in 2025. He predicts the first major public protest against AI technologies, driven by concerns about privacy, job displacement, and ethical considerations.Delangue’s perspective underscores the need for transparency and ethical frameworks in deploying AI. As AI continues to integrate into daily life, companies must address public apprehensions and ensure responsible development.Don McGuire, CFO of management services company ADP, highlights the practical applications of AI in streamlining business processes. ADP leverages GenAI to assist sales representatives, prepare for investor events, and enhance operational efficiency.McGuire sees 2025 as a year of increased AI adoption in business, stating, “Things that people used to sit beside you and have a headset, now you can do those things with GenAI tools.” His outlook reflects the broader trend of AI transforming traditional workflows, emphasizing its role in improving productivity and decision-making.Delangue also foresees a surge in consumer interest in personal AI robots. He predicts that companies like Tesla will lead the charge, with at least 100,000 personal AI robots expected to be pre-ordered in 2025. These robots, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, could redefine household management and personal assistance, bridging the gap between science fiction and reality.Michael Perica, CFO of Rimini Street, highlights the economic challenges businesses may face in 2025 due to trade policies and tariffs. He points to the impact of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, where promised tariffs on imported goods could lead to higher consumer prices and supply chain disruptions.Perica suggests that businesses will increasingly rely on AI to offset these challenges, using technology to streamline operations and prioritize critical initiatives. His analysis underscores the interconnectedness of economic policies and technological adoption, as companies navigate a rapidly changing landscape.","Artificial intelligence (AI) took center stage in 2024, sparking debates about its potential to reshape industries and daily life.

What Tencent has to say

Tencent, the Chinese social media and gaming giant, has been labeled as a ‘ Chinese military company ’ by the Pentagon on Monday, January 6 marking another escalation in the ongoing feud between the United States and China. Other than Tencent Holdings Limited , other Chinese firms, including battery maker CATL, drone manufacturer Autel Robotics, and shipping giant COSCO were also added to the list. As posted in the Federal Register, the newly expanded list now includes 134 companies.The Pentagon's Chinese military company list is a catalog of companies identified by the US Department of Defense as entities that support or are linked to the Chinese military while also engaging in commercial operations. The list is part of an effort by the US government to address concerns about China's military-civil fusion strategy, where private companies are allegedly leveraged to advance the country's military and technological capabilities.The Pentagon updates its list of ""Chinese military companies"" annually, identifying entities it claims combine commercial and military technologies.Companies on this list face warnings that US businesses working with them could risk losing future Pentagon contracts. The designation of Tencent and other firms highlights the deepening rift between the two superpowers, with economic, technological, and military competition driving the increasingly aggressive policies on both sides.The listing sent Tencent's US-listed shares tumbling nearly 10%.The decision also affects other Chinese giants. CATL, which licenses battery technology to Ford Motor for a $3.5 billion electric vehicle factory in Michigan, was among the newly listed firms.In its response, Tencent stated that the inclusion was ""clearly a mistake,"" asserting that the company is ""not a military company or supplier"" and emphasizing that the designation would have ""no impact on our business.""The company further added that it intends to ""work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding.""","The Pentagon's Chinese military company list is a catalog of companies identified by the US Department of Defense as entities that support or are linked to the Chinese military.

Infosys to rollout salary hikes by Q4, 2025

The story has been updated with HCLTech statementHCLTech has reportedly rolled out salary hikes to junior employees. According to a Money Control report, most employees at junior levels received a small raise of about 1-2% during the October-December quarter. However, this is much lower than the 7% average annual hikes and 12-15% hikes for top performers that the company had earlier promised. Other IT major IT companies like TCS , have delayed their salary hikes for FY25.…on salary increases….we have decided to go ahead with the increase. It will be along the similar lines as what we did last year. Which means, the increases will be effective in October, i.e., this month. The quantum of increases? Typically, every year when you look at the review cycle, given the fact that we have a higher proportion of people who come in laterally into our system, who will become eligible for increases at the point of completing a year, the number of individuals eligible for increases during a given cycle is a function of that, plus the performance. So, if I look at the average for all our colleagues in India, it will be in the range of about 7%. But, as is always the case, increases are linked to performance, and top performers will continue to see double-digit increases in the range of 12-15%. So, that’s the way we have planned our increases. ….it will all take effect from this month onwards. We have our own comp review cycles, which we follow every year. That’s what we did last year, that’s what we’ll do this year as well….,” said the spokesperson.As mentioned above, the majority of junior-level employees have received a raise of 1-2% during the quarter. Top performers, on the other hand, got a slightly higher hike of 3-4%.The report says that HCLTech’s hikes so far have only been given to junior-level employees – E0, E1, and E2 levels with up to 10 years of experience. Mid and senior-level employees (E3 level and above) have not received any raises yet.“E0-E2 got their letters in December last week. They got only about 1-2 percent hikes and even top performers got maximum 3-4 percent hikes. Employees in the E3 band and above are still awaiting appraisals, many of them didn’t get hikes for the last two years at least, and even three years for E4 levels,” an employee told the publication.In a related news, Infosys has announced to implement wage hikes in the fourth quarter. In October last year, the IT company announced plans to implement wage hikes in Q4FY25 in a phased manner. During a press conference following its Q2 results, Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka stated, “Some part of that will be effective in January, and the balance will be effective in April.”","HCLTech has reportedly rolled out salary hikes to junior employees.

Withings Omnia smart mirror: How is it different



French consumer electronics company Withings has unveiled a concept mirror named Omnia at CES 2025 . This smart mirror combines health tracking , AI assistance , and telehealth capabilities . The device features a base that measures weight, heart health, and metabolic health, and can integrate data from other health trackers. The mirror also has an AI voice assistant that provides real-time feedback and guidance, while also potentially facilitating virtual consultations with doctors. Omnia can even send health data to doctors for review, offering a comprehensive and futuristic approach to health management.Omnia is not yet a commercially available product; Withings has stated that it is ""currently in development,"" with no clear timeline or pricing details. Given Withings' history of CES announcements, it could be a long wait before Omnia reaches consumers if it ever does.One of the biggest highlights of the Omnia concept mirror is how it combines several existing health tech trends into one cohesive package. It's important to note that connected smart mirrors , which can display information, make video calls, and play sound, aren't new—these features were already present in Lululemon's Mirror and its imitators.Similarly, smart scales capable of measuring heart rate, taking EKGs, and analyzing body composition have also been available for years. Additionally, AI chatbots integrated into health tech emerged as a growing trend in 2024, with major brands like Oura, Whoop, and Fitbit exploring these technologies.Withings plans to offer demos at CES 2025, which may provide insight into whether Omnia is a legitimate product or just another example of CES health tech hype. Regardless of whether it becomes a tangible product, Omnia reflects the direction in which health tech is headed.Apart from this, Withings offers smartwatches, smart scales, connected blood pressure cuffs, smart thermometers, and even a noninvasive sleep tracker that fits under a mattress. The company has previously debuted products like an at-home urinalysis device for toilets and scales that analyze nerve health through the feet. It has also incorporated telemedicine features , such as cardiologist-reviewed EKG results in its FDA-cleared ScanWatch.","French consumer electronics company Withings has unveiled a concept mirror named Omnia at CES 2025.

Given the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company.”Previously, OpenAI had also said strong public oversight is needed when it comes to governing superintelligence, , asserting that the global community should have a democratic role in determining the bounds and defaults for AI systems. The company proposed an international authority to ensure safety, regulate advanced AI and manage risks, while avoiding over-regulation of less advanced systems.Altman also looked back on the journey of ChatGPT, which was initially dubbed “Chat With GPT-3.5.” Launched over two years ago on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT sparked a “growth curve like nothing we have ever seen,” he added.Altman shared how the project has now “transitioned into the next paradigm of models that can do complex reasoning,” marking the ongoing shift toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).At a New York Times’s DealBook Summit last year, he speculated that AGI could potentially emerge within this year . He reaffirmed the same in the blog, saying “we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies.”He also addressed various other topics, including the issue of being removed from OpenAI’s board after they ""lost confidence in his leadership abilities.""

What is inference-time compute and how it works

The performance of an AI model relies on one important thing: data. Recently, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever declared that the AI industry has reached “peak data”, suggesting that all useful data present on the internet has been exhausted for training AI models. However, Google seems to have found a solution to this problem.“Peak data” is a term used to describe the amount of available useful data to train an AI model. The AI industry is facing a "" peak data "" challenge wherein all useful data has already been used for training AI models.Since all the high-quality data readily available on the internet has already been used to train existing AI models, newer models might not show significant improvements over their predecessors because they're not learning from substantially new or better information.However, Google DeepMind researchers are optimistic, pointing to a promising solution: inference-time compute , as per a report by Business Insider.This technique allows AI models to tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable prompts. Each step involves a new inference request, creating a chain of reasoning where the model only progresses after solving each part correctly.This process leads to higher-quality outputs, especially in tasks with clear answers, like math problems. The breakthrough lies in using these improved outputs as fresh training data.Google DeepMind researchers proposed this method in August, suggesting an “iterative self-improvement loop” where enhanced outputs are fed back into the model for further training. This approach could bypass the “peak data” problem and fuel continued AI development.Reportedly, early results are promising, with models like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek V3 demonstrating significant improvements. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella expressed confidence in inference-time compute, calling it “another scaling law” for enhancing AI capabilities.“So you have pre-training, and then you have effectively this test-time sampling that then creates the tokens that can go back into pre-training, creating even more powerful models that then are running on your inference,” he said.""That's I think a fantastic way to increase model capability,"" Nadella added.","The AI industry is facing a "" peak data "" challenge wherein all useful data has already been used for training AI models.

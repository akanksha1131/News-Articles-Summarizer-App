"Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was same that the dead Boeing whistleblower warned about in 2024, claims report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/air-india-plane-that-crashed-in-ahmedabad-was-same-that-the-dead-boeing-whistleblower-warned-about-in-2024-claims-report/articleshow/121838124.cms,"John Barnett's controversial suicide

Last year, a former quality manager at Boeing reportedly warned that the factory that made the 787 Dreamliner was plagued by ""shoddy work practices and poor oversight"". According to a report in Gizmodo, John Barnett, who had worked for Boeing for 30 years before becoming one of its most outspoken critics, said that Boeing was building the planes with ‘sub-standard’ parts and that its mandate of speed and efficiency was endangering lives. Barnett, who refused to fly on the Dreamliner, was also involved in a legal dispute with the company at the time that he died of an apparent suicide. He is said to be one of a long list of critics who expressed concern about the company’s manufacturing practices.The report claims that the Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad killing 241 passengers was the same that Barnett had warned regulators about. Barnett had worked for the US plane giant for three decades, until his retirement in 2017 on health grounds. His death in March 2024 sparked conspiracy theories due to his involvement in the legal case against Boeing.Barnett retired Boeing in 2017. In March 2024, he was found dead at his motel in Charleston, South Carolina, just weeks after testifying against the aviation giant. The local coroner’s office reportedly said that Barnett appears to have died as the result of a self-inflicted gunshot. According to a BBC report, Barnett accused Boeing of ""denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing."" At the time of his death, Barnett reportedly had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case.The 787 was launched in 2011, with one of the advertised benefits reportedly being that Boeing could manufacture the aircraft more cheaply than its previous models. The Gizmodo report adds that from the get-go, the plane was ridiculed for having an overly complicated assembly process. The report quoting an aviation commentator said that it was as if Boeing had said “F*ck it. Let’s throw out everything we’ve ever known or used in airplane production and use this new, unproven method.”Critics noted that the company had outsourced too many parts to too many different contractors and that there was a risk that all of those components might not properly fit together when the craft was finally assembled.","John Barnett, a former quality manager at Boeing, was found dead in 2024.

Mark Cuban faces users backlash, asked to ...

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky , the decentralized social media platform he once championed, for becoming “ruder and more hateful,” according to a report by the New York Post. Cuban, known for his tech ventures and former ownership of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, warned that the platform’s lack of diverse perspectives is driving users back to Elon Musk ’s X, formerly Twitter.Cuban, who joined Bluesky in late 2024 with an optimistic post -— “Hello Less Hateful World” -- now says the platform has devolved into a hostile echo chamber. “The lack of diversity of thought here is really hurting usage,” he wrote in a series of posts this week, as quoted by the Post. He noted that the platform’s predominantly left-leaning user base often meets dissenting or nuanced opinions with outrage, stifling meaningful discussion. “Engagement went from great convos on many topics, to agree with me or you are a nazi fascist,” Cuban added.The Post reports that Cuban, who supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election but did not donate to her campaign, shared a Washington Post opinion piece by Megan McArdle, which argued that Bluesky’s left-leaning user base fosters a political silo. Cuban endorsed the piece, urging users to use the platform’s moderation tools to block rather than attack those they disagree with. “The moderation and block tools on here are so advanced, if you see someone you don’t want to see on here, just block them. Don’t attack them,” he wrote.However, Cuban’s critiques sparked backlash from some Bluesky users , the Post noted. Responses included profane attacks, with one user writing, “Go wipe your crocodile tears with a wad of hundreds you tw-t,” and another stating, “F–kin leave then, p—y.” A third user, whose post Cuban reposted, called him a “despicable bastard” and told him to “just Go Away.”The report highlighted Bluesky’s rapid growth, noting that its user base tripled from 10 million to over 30 million between November 2024 and May 2025, according to Pew Research Center. This surge followed Elon Musk’s endorsement of Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, which prompted many liberal-leaning users to leave X for Bluesky. Yet, Cuban’s recent comments suggest the platform’s ideological slant may now be pushing users back to Twitter.Cuban, whose net worth is approximately $8.35 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, lamented that even minor disagreements on Bluesky often escalate into hostility. “Even if you agree with 95% of what a person is saying on a topic, if there is one point that you might call out as being more of a grey area, they will call you a fascist etc.,” he wrote, per the Post.","Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky, the decentralized social media platform he once championed.

Amazon Prime Video's ad supported tier users may be facing a new 'problem',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-prime-videos-ad-supported-tier-users-may-be-facing-a-new-problem/articleshow/121834797.cms,"Representat

Why Amazon is increasing ad times for Prime Video users



India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

Amazon Prime Video users on the ad-supported tier may be facing an increased number of commercials. The streaming platform owned by the e-commerce giant has reportedly doubled the ads it served per hour. This rumoured change comes after Amazon introduced advertisements to its Prime Video streaming service last year, with an initial promise of a light and uniterreputing experience. According to a report by Adweek, the latest move aims to increase monetisation from its audience. The ad supported tier isn’t available in India yet, but Amazon has announced that Prime Video content in India will include ""limited advertisements"" beginning June 17.As per the report, Amazon Prime Video has doubled its ad load to “four to six minutes per hour,” up from the two to three-and-a-half minutes promised when ads launched in January 2024.An Amazon spokesperson has even confirmed the increase to AdWeek but the reported didn't specify any details. However, the report cited industry sources to claim that the company has quietly signaled the same to investors for months.This surge in ad time is part of Amazon’s broader push to monetise its streaming investment that will help the company invest billions into originals like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and The Boys, the report claims.Earlier this year, reports surfaced that Amazon would auction off ad spots and deploy more targeted, context-driven ads using its extensive consumer data. While advertisers may welcome these changes, viewers see their experience as collateral damage.To compare, Prime Video rival Netflix , has also avoided ads for years but eventually introduced an ad-supported tier to attract viewers deterred by price hikes.The report notes that streaming services often launch with generous pricing to outcompete rivals, then raise prices or increase monetisation once they dominate the market.",Amazon Prime Video users on the ad-supported tier may be facing an increased number of commercials.

Researchers find 'dangerous' AI data leak flaw in Microsoft 365 Copilot: What the company has to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/researchers-find-dangerous-ai-data-leak-flaw-in-microsoft-365-copilot-here-is-what-its-designed-to-do/articleshow/121834812.cms,"What is EchoLeak attack and how it worked

A critical artificial intelligence (AI) vulnerability has been discovered in Microsoft 365 Copilot, raising new concerns about data security in AI-integrated enterprise environments. The flaw, dubbed 'EchoLeak', which enabled attackers to exfiltrate sensitive user data with zero-click interaction, has been devised by Aim Labs researchers in January 2025.According to a report by Bleeping Computer, Aim Labs promptly reported their findings to Microsoft, which rated it as critical. Microsoft swiftly addressed the issue, implementing a server-side fix in May 2025. This means that no user action is required to patch the vulnerability.Microsoft has also stated there is no evidence of any real-world exploitation, essentially confirming that no customers were impacted by this flaw.The EchoLeak attack commenced with a malicious email sent to the target. This email contained text seemingly unrelated to Copilot, designed to resemble a typical business document. It embedded a hidden prompt injection crafted to instruct Copilot's underlying LLM to extract sensitive internal data. Because this hidden prompt was phrased like a normal message, it cleverly bypassed Microsoft's existing XPIA (cross-prompt injection attack) classifier protections.Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI assistant integrated into Office applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams, leverages OpenAI's GPT models and Microsoft Graph to help users generate content, analyse data and answer questions based on their organisation's internal files, emails, and chats.When the user prompted Copilot with a related business question, Microsoft's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine retrieved the malicious email into the LLM's prompt context due to its apparent relevance and formatting. Once inside the LLM's active context, the malicious injection ""tricked"" the AI into pulling sensitive internal data and embedding it into a specially crafted link or image.This led to unintentional leaks of internal data without explicit user intent or interaction.","Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI assistant integrated into Office applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams.

What is different in AMD's newest AI chips



AMD has unveiled details about its Instinct MI400 series , the company's next generation of AI chips set to ship next year. CEO Lisa Su presented the chips at a launch event in San Jose, California, emphasising their design for ""rack-scale"" systems crucial for powering the massive AI computations of today and tomorrow. Su also claimed that AMD’s MI355X can outperform Nvidia ’s Blackwell chips.The MI400 series chips are designed to be assembled into a full server rack, dubbed Helios, which AMD described as a unified system capable of tying thousands of chips together, as per a report by CNBC.""For the first time, we architected every part of the rack as a unified system,"" Su explained, highlighting Helios as ""really a rack that functions like a single, massive compute engine.""A significant endorsement came from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who appeared on stage with Su. Altman expressed confidence in the new chips""When you first started telling me about the specs, I was like, there’s no way, that just sounds totally crazy. It’s gonna be an amazing thing,"" said Altman, whose company is a customer of Nvidia chips. OpenAI also confirmed it will be integrating the AMD chips.This ""rack-scale"" approach is vital for hyperscale AI clusters that span entire data centers, catering to the enormous power demands of cloud providers and developers of large language models, the report said. Su directly compared Helios to Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin racks, signaling AMD's intent to directly challenge its main rival.AMD's rack-scale technology aims to put its latest chips squarely in competition with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which already offer configurations integrating 72 graphics-processing units. Nvidia currently holds a near-monopoly in the market for big data center GPUs, partly due to its early lead in developing essential AI software like CUDA.OpenAI, notably a significant Nvidia customer, has been providing feedback to AMD on its MI400 roadmap. AMD is positioning the MI400 chips, along with this year’s MI355X chips, as a more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's offerings.Su also claimed that AMD’s MI355X can outperform Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, despite Nvidia's proprietary CUDA software advantage, saying that AMD's ""really strong hardware"" and the ""tremendous progress"" made by open software frameworks.","AMD unveils MI400 series of AI chips set to ship next year.

Scale AI: Ethical issues and outsourcing techniques

Facebook owner Meta has invested in Scale AI in a deal that values the labelling startup of worth more than $29 billion. The CEO and co-founder of Scale AI is a 28-year-old Alexandr Wang who has emerged as one of the most influential figures in the artificial intelligence landscape. Scale AI initially was a data-labeling company and quickly became an underlying face of the AI revolution, quietly serving as an enabler of everything from self-driving cars to large language models (LLMs). Wang is now moving into a leadership role of high stakes at Meta, taking the helm at a newly created research lab aimed at creating artificial superintelligence (ASI).Meta is spending $15 billion to buy a 49% stake in Scale AI at a valuation of more than $29 billion, as reported by Reuters. This strategic acquisition marks Meta's aggressive push to surpass competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. Wang will join Meta's new 50-person research lab to spearhead the creation of ASI; AI systems with intelligence greater than humans. The agreement also comprises seven to nine-figure pay packages to entice top AI talent away from top institutions and competitors.Meta's foray into superintelligence is at an important time. Though Meta made ambitious moves such as embedding AI in products like Ray-Ban smart glasses and open-sourcing its Llama models, it has trailed behind rivals in important AI developments. The company has been grappling with internal tension, employee turnover, and lackluster product releases. Its AI work was previously led by chief scientist Yann LeCun, who developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs). LeCun's distrust of LLMs and AGI, however, has opened up philosophical fault lines within Meta's AI leadership.Alexandr Wang, CEO and co-founder of Scale AI was born and raised in New Mexico by Chinese immigrant parents who were physicists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Wang's intellectual heritage runs deep. He held a short-term stint at Quora prior to dropping out of MIT after his first year. He then joined Y Combinator spearheaded at the time by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and founded Scale AI with co-founder Lucy Guo. Although Guo later exited the company, Wang continued to build Scale into a unicorn, securing investments from Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and reaching a $7 billion valuation by 2019. At just 24, he was named the youngest self-made billionaire.Scale AI founded in 2016 focused on organising and labeling vast datasets initially for autonomous vehicles. It emerged as the preeminent data infrastructure company for AI creators, hosting clients such as Waymo, Toyota, Honda, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It also serves the US government in interpreting satellite imagery. Scale had $870 million in revenue in 2024 and hopes to double that in 2025 and, possibly, hit a $25 billion valuation. However, increased competition from companies such as Surge AI, Labelbox, and Snorkel AI brings new challenges.Even though Scale AI has been successful, it has also come under fire for outsourcing data labeling to the low-cost labor markets of Kenya, Venezuela, India, and the Philippines. Using its own platform, Remotasks, Scale trains the workers to do data annotation, typically in reportedly suboptimal working conditions, for less than $1 per hour. This has led to broader discussions concerning the ethics of human-in-the-loop AI systems.Alexandr Wang has also developed close relationships with the leading figures in the technology world such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and applied his increasing influence to open up in Washington DC. Alexandr Wang, who is not from a research background, has created a mighty AI business with an incisive business mind and revived Meta's AI vision better than the usual research-focused leadership.","Scale AI founded in 2016 focused on organising and labeling vast datasets initially for autonomous vehicles.

Verdict on July 2, what proscecutors want

Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment, with a French court hearing disturbing accounts from former employees, predominantly women, about a toxic workplace culture at the gaming giant’s Paris headquarters during the 2010s, according to The Guardian. The accusations, reportedly described as “extremely serious” by prosecutor Antoine Haushalter, include incidents of employees being tied to chairs, forced to perform handstands, subjected to sexual jokes, exposed to pornographic videos in the office, and enduring crude behavior, such as a boss farting in employees’ faces. One woman reported a manager drawing a penis on her arm during a video call with senior leaders. The court case marks the gaming industry’s first major #MeToo trial.The accused include Tommy Francois, 52, former Vice President of Editorial & Creative Services; Serge Hascoet, 59, former Chief Creative Officer; and Guillaume Patrux, 41, former Game Director. Ubisoft, known for blockbuster titles like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Just Dance, was allegedly a “Boys’ Club” where such misconduct thrived, per The Guardian.Francois faces charges of sexual harassment, bullying, and attempted sexual assault. The Guardian reported that he allegedly tied a female employee to a chair before sending her in an elevator to a random floor and forced a woman in a skirt to do handstands, leaving her terrified. At a 2015 office party, he reportedly attempted to kiss a woman while others restrained her; she escaped after shouting. Another woman accused Francois of grabbing her hair and attempting a forced kiss at a U.S. gaming event, showing her nude photos, and drawing on her arm during a video call. Ubisoft’s HR allegedly dismissed her concerns, advising her not to escalate. Francois denies all allegations.Hascoet is accused of bullying and sexual harassment, including making inappropriate sexual comments, such as telling a woman on a work trip she “needed sex” in front of colleagues, and joking that a used tissue he handed to a female employee was “worth gold at Ubisoft,” per The Guardian. He allegedly made sexual noises, forced assistants to run personal errands, and denies any intent to harass.Patrux faces similar charges, accused of punching walls, pretending to strike employees, cracking a whip near faces, joking about an office shooting, and burning an employee’s beard with a lighter, according to The Guardian. He also denies the allegations.Haushalter called the trial an important moment for the gaming industry, highlighted by the #MeToo movement, which empowered victims to speak out. He also highlighted “strong proof” of systemic mistreatment and requested suspended prison sentences of up to three years and fines for the trio. The court concluded hearings, with a verdict expected on July 2, 2025.","Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment.

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which was once commonly linked to war veterans, has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence throughout all demographics and occupations. The most recent public reference to it is by Errol Musk, who explained his son Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump as stemming fromAlthough those claims tend to fuel controversy, they also point to the larger, more serious discourse surrounding mental health, particularly in high-pressure settings such as politics, governance, or technology entrepreneurship.PTSD is a stress disorder that can happen to anyone who has witnessed or experienced a traumatic experience. From victims of natural disasters and violent offenses to those subjected to chronic emotional stress, PTSD can drastically interfere with daily life and quality of life if not treated. Here's a comprehensive overview of PTSD, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and contemporary treatment methods.PTSD stands forr, a mental health condition that may occur following exposure to or witnessing a traumatic event.It is accepted within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and may occur in individuals of all ages, including children.PTSD is different from the temporary emotional distress that most individuals experience following trauma. Although many recover on their own, those with PTSD remain affected by long-lasting symptoms that can last for months or even years and disrupt their normal functioning.PTSD may result from a variety of traumatic events. While some individuals develop the disorder following a one-time event, others become affected after repeated exposure to stressful situations. They are commonly triggered by:It is worth noting that not everyone who is exposed to trauma will develop PTSD. Genetics, brain chemistry, coping methods, and support systems can all play a role in a person's risk.PTSD symptoms typically start within three months of the traumatic event but at other times may emerge later. To be considered for PTSD diagnosis, the symptoms should persist for more than a month and lead to major distress or impairments in social or occupational functioning.PTSD symptoms are typically classified into four clusters:Although PTSD may occur in anyone, some individuals are at higher risk:Studies also indicate that women are more likely than men to experience PTSD, perhaps because of higher incidence rates of interpersonal violence.PTSD is usually diagnosed by a mental health professional, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker, based on criteria from the DSM-5. The diagnostic process involves:At other times, symptom quantification is achieved through the use of standardized measurement tools such as the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5).Contemporary treatment of PTSD aims to enable people to manage symptoms, re-establish trust, and take back control of their lives. They comprise:Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most effective type of psychotherapy for PTSD. It involves:There is no surefire method to prevent PTSD, but early treatment can drastically lower risk and severity:","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence.

"Meta, TikTok challenge EU’s Big Tech fee; call it “unfair and disproportionate”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-tiktok-challenge-eus-big-tech-fee-call-it-unfair-and-disproportionate/articleshow/121796298.cms,"What Meta and TikTok said about Europe’s DSA

What the European Commission argue

Xiaomi QLED TV FX Pro 55-inch Review: Affordable Cinematic Experience at Home

Meta and TikTok have taken the European Union to court over a fee which they claim is unfair and based on flawed calculations. Speaking before Europe’s second-highest court on Wednesday, the two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency. The law, which came into effect in 2022, requires 19 large online platforms to pay a fee—up to 0.05% of their annual global net income—to help fund the European Commission's work overseeing their compliance with digital rules.Stating that the company is not trying to avoid paying the fees, Meta’s lawyer questioned the Commission’s method for calculating the fee. In a General Court in Luxembourg, he said it was wrongly based on the overall group’s revenue, not the revenue of the EU-based subsidiary, and that the company still doesn’t know exactly how the final amount was reached.TikTok’s lawyer echoed similar concerns, calling the fee “unfair and disproportionate.” He said the method used inflated TikTok’s payment and even required the company to help cover the cost for other platforms. He also accused the EU of counting the same user more than once if they switch between devices, which he said led to double-counting.Both companies argued that the Commission went beyond its legal powers by using group-level profits to calculate the cap for the fee.In response, the European Commission’s lawyer defended the system, saying that when a company files consolidated financial reports, it’s reasonable to use group-level financial data. She also said that companies had access to enough information to understand how the fee was determined and that there was no violation of their rights.","The two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

Tesla has filed a federal lawsuit accusing a former employee of stealing trade secrets related to its humanoid robot project, Optimus, and using them to start a competing company. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday, June 11 in San Francisco. The case is Tesla Inc v. Proception Inc , U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:25-cv-04963. It claims that Zhongjie ""Jay"" Li — who worked on robotic hand sensors at Tesla from August 2022 to September 2024 — downloaded confidential files shortly before resigning. Just days after leaving, he allegedly founded a new startup, Proception Inc.Tesla says that within five months, Proception unveiled robotic hands that closely resemble the ones Li helped develop at Tesla. The lawsuit names both Li and Proception as defendants, accusing them of misusing Tesla’s confidential information.""Through Li’s pilfering, Defendant Proception purportedly achieved in a matter of months what it has taken Tesla over four years, hundreds of employees, and billions of dollars to achieve,"" the complaint said.According to Tesla, Li worked on the robot’s sensor team between 2022 and 2024. Even though he had stopped working on the robot’s hands, Tesla claims he downloaded confidential files about their movement shortly before quitting in 2024.Six days after leaving, Li started a new company called Proception. Just five months later, the startup showed off robotic hands that Tesla says look very similar to its own designs, the lawsuit alleges.Tesla is asking the court to stop Li and his company from using any of its trade secrets and is also seeking financial compensation.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously called Tesla's robotic hand “the most sophisticated ever made,” and believes the Optimus robot could become the company's most valuable product. He has said that robots like Optimus could impact national economies in as little as four to five years and learn tasks by watching online videos.","Tesla has filed a federal lawsuit accusing a former employee of stealing trade secrets related to its humanoid robot project, Optimus.

Ahmedabad plane crash: Black Box recovered for Air India Boeing 787-7 Dreamliner; What it can tell us about the tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ahmedabad-plane-crash-black-box-recovered-for-air-india-boeing-787-7-dreamliner-what-it-can-tell-us-about-the-tragedy/articleshow/121831054.cms,"What is a Black Box and what can it tell us about the Ahmedabad plane crash

Why is the second Black Box so important to the investigation

Where will be the Black Box data for Air India Boeing 787-7 Dreamliner be analyzed

How long will the Air India crash investigation take

Authorities have successfully recovered one of two Black Boxes from the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport on June 12, killing 241 of 242 people aboard. The flight data recorder was found on the rooftop of a medical college hostel that the aircraft struck during the tragedy.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) confirmed the recovery within 28 hours of the crash, marking a crucial breakthrough in determining what caused Flight AI-171 to issue a Mayday call and crash just 11 seconds after becoming airborne. The London-bound flight was carrying 242 passengers and crew when it went down in Ahmedabad's Meghaninagar area.Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu announced the recovery on social media, calling it ""an important step forward in the investigation"" that will ""significantly aid the enquiry into the incident."" The second Black Box, located in the aircraft's front section, remains missing and search operations continue.Despite their name, aircraft Black Boxes are actually bright orange crash-resistant devices designed to survive extreme impact, fire, and water pressure. Every commercial aircraft carries two such recorders: the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR).The recovered FDR contains thousands of technical parameters including altitude, speed, engine performance, control surface positions, and system warnings. For the Ahmedabad crash investigation, this data will reveal precise details about the aircraft's final moments, including whether the disaster resulted from mechanical failure, engine malfunction, or other factors.Modern Boeing 787 aircraft can record thousands of data points per second, providing investigators with a second-by-second reconstruction of events. The FDR will show exactly what the aircraft's systems were doing when Captain Sumeet Sabharwal issued the desperate Mayday call reporting ""no thrust, losing power, unable to lift.""While the recovered FDR reveals what the aircraft did, the missing Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) is equally crucial as it captures the human element of the tragedy. The CVR records all cockpit audio including pilot conversations, radio transmissions, warning alarms, and mechanical sounds that could provide vital clues about crew responses and decision-making.Aviation experts emphasize that finding both Black Boxes is essential for a complete investigation. The FDR shows the aircraft's technical behavior, but only the CVR can reveal whether pilots correctly identified problems, followed emergency procedures, or faced communication breakdowns during the crisis.The CVR would capture any emergency checklists being executed, crew coordination efforts, or discussions about mechanical problems that preceded the crash. This human context is vital for understanding whether the tragedy resulted from system failures, pilot error, or a combination of factors.The recovered Black Box will likely be analyzed at India's state-of-the-art Digital Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder (DFDR & CVR) Laboratory, which was inaugurated in Delhi earlier this year. This specialized facility represents a significant advancement in India's aviation investigation capabilities.The Delhi laboratory enables the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) to repair damaged Black Boxes, retrieve data, and conduct thorough analyses of accidents and incidents domestically. Previously, such critical data extraction often required sending Black Boxes to international facilities, causing delays in investigations.This new facility is equipped with cutting-edge technology to handle even severely damaged recording devices, ensuring that crucial flight data can be recovered and analyzed quickly. The laboratory's capabilities will be particularly valuable for the Ahmedabad crash investigation, as it allows Indian investigators to maintain full control over the sensitive data extraction process.Initial data extraction from the recovered Black Box typically requires 2-4 weeks for intact devices, according to international aviation protocols. With the new Delhi facility, this process can now be conducted entirely within India, potentially reducing the timeline for preliminary findings.However, comprehensive analysis takes significantly longer. The International Civil Aviation Organization mandates preliminary findings within 30 days, but final investigation reports typically require 12-24 months to complete. This timeline allows investigators to cross-reference Black Box data with maintenance records, weather conditions, radar logs, and witness statements.For the Ahmedabad crash, the investigation timeline may be extended as this marks the first fatal crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner since the aircraft entered commercial service in 2011. US investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board will assist Indian authorities, potentially expediting the technical analysis process.The complexity of analyzing thousands of data parameters per second, combined with the need to understand how the advanced 787's systems behaved during the emergency, means investigators will need considerable time to provide definitive answers about what caused this devastating aviation tragedy.Aviation investigation expert Greg Feith notes that while extracting data is relatively quick, ""understanding the story it tells takes considerable time"" - a process that could provide crucial insights for preventing future disasters.","Authorities have recovered one of two Black Boxes from the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport on June 12.

He went on to add that the company is finding ways to improve performance through methods such as cluster computing.The article, published on the front page of the newspaper, reportedly came just days ahead of the top U.S. and Chinese officials' trade talks in London where topics such U.S. tech restrictions on China were discussed.Huawei is just one of many Chinese chipmakers, Ren said in the interview, adding: ""The United States has exaggerated Huawei's achievements. Huawei is not that great. We have to work hard to reach their evaluation."" ""Our single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation. We use mathematics to supplement physics, non-Moore's law to supplement Moore's law and cluster computing to supplement single chips and the results can also achieve practical conditions. Software is not a bottleneck for us,"" he said.Ren's comments are the first ever from him or Huawei about the company's advanced chipmaking efforts, which have become a flashpoint in U.S.-China tensions.Huawei CEO's statement surprised some analysts in the US. As an opinion piece in Bloomberg said, ""Part of the reason that Ren’s humble admission raised eyebrows is because of Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang has spent the better part of this year heaping praise on Huawei’s breakthroughs. Huang said China is “not behind” in AI, and called the Shenzhen giant, specifically, “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”At the same time it also added, that where Ren is very much correct is that the domestic alternatives in China aren’t quite there yet. Huawei reportedly is not the top choice for Chinese tech companies. ""There’s a reason the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., ByteDance Ltd., and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have spent billions hoarding Nvidia chips before the onset of new restrictions rather than pivot to Huawei’s to train and run their AI models,"" it added.Huawei CEO said that the company is still a generation behind the US, he also added that is ""no need to worry about the chip problem"". He said the same addressing concerns stemming from U.S. export controls. Huawei is said to invest 180 billion yuan ($25.07 billion) in research annually and sees promise in compound chips.Since 2019, US export curbs have restricted Huawei and other Chinese firms from accessing high-end chips and the equipment needed to produce them from abroad.","Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei recently made a statement to the state media People's Daily that reportedly left many American analysts puzzled. Ren's comments are the first ever from him or Huawei about the company's advanced chipmaking efforts. Since 2019, US export curbs have restricted Huawei and other Chinese firms from accessing high-end chips and the equipment needed to produce them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121829534,imgsize-74750,width-400,resizemode-4/Ren-Zhengfei-Huawei.jpg"

When asked to sum up their success in just one word, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both responded with the same answer. Despite coming from different industries, their paths to becoming two of the world’s most influential billionaires were shaped by an intense dedication to their respective passions. Gates revolutionised personal computing while Buffett transformed the investment world with long-term strategies. Their routines, habits, and decisions were rooted in purpose rather than chance. Their journeys offer lessons that apply well beyond boardrooms or billion-dollar deals. Whether you're a student, professional, or entrepreneur, understanding what shaped their success can provide insight into how to shape your own path.In a 2016 conversation moderated by Charlie Rose, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett were each asked to write down one word that best explained their success. Without any prior discussion, both chose the same word: focus. This shared answer reflected a deep truth about their lives. Gates had focused himself in computer programming during his teenage years, eventually leading to the creation of tech giant Microsoft. Buffett, on the other hand, began investing at the age of 11 and built his empire through disciplined long-term strategies. Their ability to concentrate on one area for decades helped them to develop unmatched expertise and build lasting success.Bill Gates has often said that the things you focus on as a teenager can shape your entire future. In a 2016 interview with Charlie Rose, he shared how his obsession with computer programming between the ages of 13 and 18 laid the foundation for what would become Microsoft. His interest in technology was sparked when he got access to a computer at his school and started learning codes. He was fascinated by the potential of software to solve problems. In 1975, he dropped out of Harvard and co-founded Microsoft with Paul Allen. Gates led the company through major innovations like Windows that made personal computing accessible to millions. That early focus turned into one of the most successful tech companies in the world. By age 20, Gates had already become a millionaire. Today, his net worth is estimated at about $127 billion, making him one of the richest persons on Earth.Warren Buffett showed a strong interest in money and business from an early age. He bought his first stock at the age of 11 and never stopped learning about investing. Fascinated by numbers and value he spent hours reading financial reports and books like The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham which shaped his thinking. Buffett studied economics and built a strategy based on buying undervalued but strong companies. As the head of Berkshire Hathaway he turned a small textile firm into a powerful holding company with stakes in Geico, Coca-Cola, American Express and Apple. Known for his discipline and patience he rarely follows market trends. His focus on long-term value helped him become one of the most successful investors in history. With a net worth near 160 billion dollars Buffett’s life shows the strength of staying focused on a single goal.At an event hosted by Gates’ father, both Gates and Buffett were asked to write down one word that explained their success. Without consulting each other, they both wrote the same thing—focus. Buffett later explained that they had each found their strength early and stuck with it. Gates focused on software. Buffett focused on investments. Their ability to commit and stay on track made all the difference.You don’t have to be a billionaire to apply these lessons. Start with these three simple ideas:Start early if you can: The earlier you begin, the more time your skills or investments have to grow. But even a late start can be powerful if you're consistent.Stay consistent: Both Gates and Buffett focused deeply and stuck with their mission over decades. They didn’t change direction often, and that gave their efforts time to succeed.Think long term: Buffett believes in long-term investing and sticking with quality companies. Gates built a company with a long-term vision for the future of computing.The takeaway is clear. Whether your dream is to build software, run a business, or master a craft, the key is to find your focus and stick with it. In a world full of distractions, staying true to a single direction can be the biggest advantage of all.",Bill Gates and Warren Buffett were asked to sum up their success in just one word.

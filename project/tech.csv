What may slowdown India in 2025

The bigger AI worry than jobs getting displaced

GitHub , the Microsoft-owned software development platform, has revised its earlier prediction that India would surpass the US as the world's largest developer community by 2027. The new forecast now suggests this will happen in 2028, citing factors like global economic conditions and the rapid growth of the US developer market, fueled by AI advancements.In an interaction with Economic Times (ET), GitHub chief executive officer Thomas Dohmke said, “If India would slow down next year for whatever reason…, those numbers are often also dependent on things out of our control.” Dohmke added, “The overall economic environment, the demand global system integrators are seeing, the startup ecosystem, how many students come out of the colleges in the next year, the year, those (students) started in the middle of Covid... So, there are a lot of factors playing into these models.”While India's developer base continues to grow significantly, reaching 17 million in 2023, the US market, with 23.8 million developers, remains the largest. GitHub's CEO, Thomas Dohmke, expressed optimism about India's long-term potential, highlighting the country's strong startup ecosystem, growing number of tech graduates, and government support for technology initiatives.Talking about the impact of AI on jobs, Dohmke emphasized the potential of AI tools like Microsoft Copilot to boost productivity and efficiency. “When I look at my own backlog and workload at Microsoft and GitHub, we certainly have more work than ever. And we’re not worried about AI taking away half the engineering jobs. I think we’re much more worried that AI has added additional skills and challenges to what a full-stack engineer has to do today,” said GitHub CEO.However, he acknowledged concerns about job displacement and the need for developers to adapt to new skills, such as prompt engineering. Dohmke said, “We need to provide paths to upskill those employees into new job families that require skills like prompting, prompt crafting, etc. We’re going to see that shift.”To further support India's developer community, GitHub plans to expand its presence in the country by opening more centers of excellence in partnership with Indian companies. These centers will focus on training developers on AI-powered tools and techniques.","GitHub revised its earlier prediction that India would surpass the US as the world's largest developer community by 2027.

A recent TikTok video has sent the internet abuzz after an Amazon Alexa device made a chilling prediction about the United States. According to the virtual assistant, the US will cease to exist by February 2031, a result of a global unification effort.According to a report in NewYork Post, which has shared the video, the content creator named Lucy Blake shared the video about the disturbing prediction on Tiktok. “On February 20, 2031, the United States of America ceases to exist,” the device reportedly claimed in the clip. “This date marks the culmination of a process of unification between various governments that was not approved by most people,” it goes on to add.The TikTok video has over two million views since being posted earlier this month. Blake claimed that the creepy answer only occurred on one occasion and that her home device no longer gives the same answer when prompted. Instead, her “brand new Alexa” only responds with, “I don’t knowWhile the TikTok video has garnered over a million views, many are skeptical about the accuracy of the prediction, attributing it to a glitch or a pre-programmed response. However, the eerie timing of the prediction, coming shortly after one of the most 'divided' US presidential election, has fueled speculation and sparked a range of reactions, from humor to concern.This isn't the first time Amazon's AI assistant has generated controversy. Earlier this year, Alexa devices were accused of providing biased responses, favoring specific political candidates. Amazon attributed the incident to an error that was quickly rectified.While Alexa's apocalyptic vision may be a mere quirk, it serves as a reminder of the growing influence of AI in our lives and the need for careful oversight.","A recent TikTok video has sent the internet abuzz after an Amazon Alexa device made a chilling prediction about the United States.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has granted approval to Google parent Alphabet’s arm Shoreline International Holdings LLC to acquire a stake in Walmart-owned e-commerce firm Flipkart. The proposed transaction comprises investment through subscription of shares of Flipkart Private Limited by Shoreline International Holdings LLC; and an arrangement between an affiliate of Alphabet and Flipkart's subsidiary for the provision of certain services.Shoreline International Holding is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Google's parent firm Alphabet Inc. It is a holding company and does not own or operate any Google products or services, CCI said in its order.""Flipkart is a subsidiary of Walmart Inc and ultimately belongs to the Walmart Group. It is primarily engaged in the business of wholesale cash and carry of goods and providing marketplace-based e-commerce platforms to facilitate trade between customers and sellers in India,"" reads the CCI order.Google's investment in Flipkart is part of a nearly $1 billion funding round that the company closed in May this year.

Flipkart at that time said that the investment is subject to regulatory and customary approvals from both parties.US retail giant Walmart, which holds an 85 per cent holding in Flipkart, has invested $600 million in the fundraise that kicked off in 2023.In its order, the CCI said that Google's investment in Flipkart involved ""an extremely small and non-controlling acquisition of shareholding"" and that the two parties would continue operating independently after the transaction.""Nonetheless, if the Hon’ble Commission were to assess competitive effects, its assessment should only focus on the markets that are directly implicated by the proposed transaction i.e., the market for cloud services in India,"" it said in the order.",The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has granted approval to Google parent Alphabet’s arm Shoreline International Holdings LLC to acquire a stake in Walmart-owned e-commerce firm Flipkart.

Tesla CEO’s growing global influence

Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump , reports The Information. The call took place shortly after Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election. It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ... In October again, Trump claimed that Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald’s. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he said “I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google”.Elon Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump in the US elections, has reportedly spent close to $130m to help get the former president re-elected. He was recently appointed as co-chair of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,” Trump said.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has previously participated in calls with global leaders and has offered advice on personnel decisions, both privately and publicly, through X—the social media platform he acquired in 2022. He has briefly joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as listened during a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Additionally, Musk has been seen frequently at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, taking part in sensitive discussions.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump.

James Howells, who famously lost a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoins (now worth approximately Rs 5,900 crore) in 2009, is facing another ‘bad news’. His former partner, Halfina Eddy-Evans, has reportedly confessed to discarding the hard drive at a Newport, Wales landfill nearly a decade ago.According to a report by Mail Online, the drive was with Howells until 2013 when she accidentally threw it away. Eddy-Evans claims she was unaware of the hard drive’s contents and was simply following Howells' request to dispose of a bag of rubbish.“Yes, I threw away his rubbish, he asked me to. The computer part had been disposed of in a black sack along with other unwanted belongings and he begged me to take it away,” she said.As per Eddy-Evans, she did not know that the hard disk contained the digital key to access 8,000 bitcoins that Howells mined in 2009.“I had no idea what was in it but I reluctantly dropped it off at the local tip on the way home from going on the school run. I thought he should be running his errands, not me, but I did it to help out,”“Losing it was not my fault”, she said, adding, “I'd love nothing more than him to find it. I'm sick and tired of hearing about it.”Howells has been looking for the hard drive since 2013 and has urged Newport City Council to allow him to access the landfill. Howells is suing the council for Rs 4,900 crore, alleging they are preventing him from accessing the landfill to search for the lost hard drive.Meanwhile, the council maintains that excavation is prohibited under their environmental permit and would cause significant disruption.Eddy-Evans says she wants no part in the potential fortune and hopes he can find closure.","James Howells lost a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoins (now worth approximately Rs 5,900 crore) in 2009.

Qualcomm may have ‘abandoned’ its Intel takeover bid due to this ‘big’ reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/qualcomm-may-have-abandoned-its-intel-takeover-bid-due-to-this-big-reason/articleshow/115700360.cms,"Why Qualcomm’s interest waned in buying Intel

‘One of the biggest deals in the tech world…’

Qualcomm’s rumored interest in acquiring Intel has cooled, according to recent reports. The potential deal, which could have been one of the largest in tech history, is said to have encountered substantial hurdles, prompting Qualcomm to rethink its approach.Citing sources familiar with the matter, a report by Bloomberg said that the complexities associated with acquiring all of Intel made a deal less attractive to Qualcomm. However, the people said that Qualcomm may acquire some part of the business or “rekindle its interest later”.Qualcomm's initial approach to Intel surfaced in September, shortly after Intel announced disappointing financial results, a reduced revenue forecast and significant job cuts.The potential acquisition faced numerous challenges, the Bloomberg report said. This includes Intel's substantial debt exceeding $50 billion and the likelihood of prolonged antitrust scrutiny in key markets like China – a key market for both companies.Moreover, Qualcomm’s lack of experience in semiconductor manufacturing may have been difficult for it to manage Intel's struggling manufacturing unit.Add to the mix Qualcomm active exploration of new markets, including PCs, networking, and automotive chips, with the goal of generating an additional $22 billion in annual revenue by 2029.CEO Cristiano Amon recently stated that Qualcomm hasn't identified any large acquisitions as necessary for achieving this goal.Had it materialised, an Intel acquisition would have been one of the largest in history, surpassing Broadcom's purchase of VMWare in 2023 as the biggest tech hardware acquisition ever. Such a deal could have significantly reshaped the semiconductor industry, creating a dominant US chipmaker amidst global efforts to bolster domestic chip production.","Qualcomm's initial approach to Intel surfaced in September, shortly after Intel announced disappointing financial results, a reduced revenue forecast and significant job cuts.

""However, achieving a balance between speed and quality remains essential. Security and stability are equally important, and systems must be resilient enough to recover quickly when things go wrong. This concept of cyber resilience—building enough redundancies into systems—is vital,”

“But redundancy, though often undervalued, is crucial for resilience. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Systems must incorporate redundancies to ensure stability and rapid recovery during disruptions. Resilience, stability, and efficiency must all be equally prioritised to create robust systems,”

NASSCOM president Rajesh Nambiar has compared the July CrowdStrike outage to a security team accidentally setting your house on fire. The incident triggered the infamous ""blue screen of death"" and caused millions of Windows systems to crash globally. This outage disrupted critical industries like airlines, hospitals, and banks. During a panel discussion at an event organised by the India Global Forum in the UAE, Nambiar highlighted the need for a balance between speed and quality in IT deployments to prevent such widespread disruptions in the coming days.Nambiar also emphasised the importance of artificial intelligence in making software development more efficient. He highlighted AI's potential to minimise errors in Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) cycles, where product vendors frequently release updates.Nambiar noted.Nambiar even highlighted the need for IT systems to be resilient in addition to being efficient. He argued against the trend of minimising redundancies to maximise performance, pointing out that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of such an approach. The pandemic emphasised the importance of building robust systems that can withstand disruptions, even if it means sacrificing some efficiency.he added.Nambiar also emphasised the dual importance of cybersecurity in the age of AI. He distinguished between two critical areas: securing AI systems themselves and leveraging AI to enhance cybersecurity.AI systems, especially those using large language models, handle sensitive data and are vulnerable to breaches. As AI adoption grows, robust cybersecurity measures become even more crucial to protect against data leaks and other threats.""When training LLMs, there’s significant potential for biases to creep in, and during inference, these systems may exhibit hallucinations,"" he explained.","NASSCOM president Rajesh Nambiar has compared the July CrowdStrike outage to a security team accidentally setting your house on fire.

Professional networking giant LinkedIn has recently let go of approximately 200 employees, accounting for about 1% of its total workforce, as reported by tech outlet The Information. The layoffs, which reportedly impacted the engineering and customer support teams, mark the latest in a series of workforce reductions by the company over the past two years. Owned by Microsoft , LinkedIn has been navigating a dynamic economic environment, balancing the integration of advanced technologies like generative AI with shifting market demands.This development comes amidst broader cost-cutting measures across tech companies worldwide, with LinkedIn and Microsoft adapting to evolving challenges in the tech landscape.According to the report, the layoffs occurred over the past two weeks, impacting employees in engineering and customer support roles. While LinkedIn has not officially commented on the specific reasons behind this decision, industry experts speculate that it is part of an ongoing effort to optimize operational efficiency amid economic uncertainties.This is not the first instance of layoffs at LinkedIn. In 2023, the platform announced multiple workforce reductions, citing the need to adapt to market conditions. These measures included the closure of its China-specific job application, marking a significant shift in the company’s global strategy.LinkedIn’s parent company, Microsoft, has also been actively reducing its workforce in 2024. More than 1,000 employees across various divisions have been laid off this year alone. Like LinkedIn, Microsoft has focused on integrating generative AI technologies into its product ecosystem, which has reshaped certain job roles while creating demand for new skill sets.LinkedIn and Microsoft have been at the forefront of adopting generative AI tools, aiming to enhance user experience and attract both individual and enterprise users. On LinkedIn, AI features now allow users to generate personalised content for their posts and craft comments on others' updates. While these advancements streamline user interactions and increase engagement, they also influence internal workflows, potentially contributing to the restructuring of certain teams.The company’s investment in AI aligns with a broader industry trend but underscores a challenging reality: adopting cutting-edge technologies can often lead to workforce realignments.The layoffs reflect ongoing challenges in the tech sector, where companies are tightening budgets amidst global economic headwinds. Despite LinkedIn’s prominence as the leading professional networking platform, it is not immune to fluctuating market conditions. Over the past year, many tech companies, including Meta, Google, and Amazon, have implemented large-scale layoffs to remain competitive and resilient.LinkedIn’s decision to reduce its workforce aligns with its strategy to maintain financial stability while continuing to evolve as a platform. The integration of AI tools represents a move toward long-term innovation, but it also comes with immediate implications for staffing.In addition to workforce changes, LinkedIn has adjusted its regional strategies. The company’s decision in 2023 to wind down its China-centric app highlighted its approach to focus on core markets with more predictable growth potential. This strategic pivot complements its broader aim to invest in AI-driven solutions that redefine professional networking.LinkedIn’s recent layoffs suggest that the company is positioning itself to navigate a complex economic and technological landscape. As it continues to integrate AI and adjust its operations, the company’s ability to balance innovation with workforce stability will be a key factor in maintaining its leadership in the professional networking space.For employees, these layoffs serve as a reminder of the shifting priorities in the tech industry, where automation and innovation often come at the expense of traditional roles. For LinkedIn users, the platform's AI enhancements promise a more seamless experience, albeit against the backdrop of internal transitions.","LinkedIn has laid off approximately 200 employees, about 1% of its total workforce. The layoffs occurred over the past two weeks, impacting employees in engineering and customer support roles. The company has not officially commented on the specific reasons behind this decision. This is the latest in a series of workforce reductions by the company.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115697250,imgsize-30800,width-400,resizemode-4/115697250.jpg"

What users can do:

A TRAI deadline could disrupt the seamless flow of OTPs (One-Time Passwords) for millions of Indian mobile users. Telecom giants Airtel, Vodafone-Idea, and Reliance Jio have been given a final extension until December 1, 2024, to implement new traceability rules mandated by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).The goal of these new traceability rules is to make it more difficult for scammers to send fake OTPs and other fraudulent messages. By knowing the source of a message, telecom operators can take steps to block malicious messages and protect consumers from harm.TRAI's new regulations aim to curb spam and phishing messages by requiring telecom operators to trace the origin of commercial messages, including OTPs. This measure is intended to enhance security and protect consumers from fraudulent activities.If telecom operators fail to comply with the deadline, it could lead to significant disruptions in OTP delivery. Users may experience delays or even complete blockage of OTPs from various services, including banking, e-commerce, and social media platforms.To mitigate these concerns, TRAI has allowed a gradual implementation process. From now until November 30th, operators will issue daily warnings to entities that fail to comply with chain declaration requirements. Starting December 1st, messages from non-compliant entities will be blocked.While telecom operators work to meet the deadline, users can take the following precautions:* Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts.* Be wary of phishing attempts: Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown apps.* Keep your device secure: Use strong passwords, update your device's software regularly, and install reputable security apps.","A TRAI deadline could disrupt the seamless flow of OTPs for millions of Indian mobile users.

As Pakistan faces yet another chapter of political unrest, the country has witnessed widespread disruptions on social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, along with significant internet outages. These disruptions coincided with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan , resuming its march toward Islamabad to protest what it terms as a “stolen mandate” and unjust arrests. While the government had earlier announced potential internet curbs in protest-affected areas, the lack of official communication regarding the disruptions has fueled speculation about their intent and timing.The protest march and the associated internet outages reflect the ongoing tensions between the ruling administration and PTI supporters.Reports from Downdetector.com, a platform that monitors online outages, confirmed that users in Pakistan experienced difficulties accessing WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms. Internet connectivity itself was also sporadic in several regions.The Pakistani government had earlier indicated plans to curtail internet services in areas of heightened security concerns. However, the broader disruptions to social media platforms were not explicitly addressed, leaving users and experts speculating about whether these measures were deliberate or coincidental.The outages have significantly impacted communication, with protestors facing challenges in coordinating their activities. For ordinary citizens, the inability to access critical communication tools has added another layer of frustration in an already tense environment.Imran Khan, the 72-year-old former prime minister, issued a “final call” for nationwide protests on November 24. The PTI-led demonstrations aimed to:In his absence, the march is being led by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi.The march, which began on Sunday from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, faced significant obstacles, including:Despite these hurdles, the protestors camped overnight at Haro in Attock district, Punjab, before resuming their journey toward Islamabad on Monday.The Pakistani government justified the restrictions and internet curbs as necessary to maintain order, particularly in light of a high-level delegation from Belarus visiting Islamabad. The delegation, led by Foreign Minister Maksim Ryzinkov, arrived ahead of an official visit by President Alexander Lukashenko. Important bilateral agreements were expected during discussions with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief General Asim Munir.Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar criticized PTI’s timing for the protests, accusing the party of engaging in a “well-thought-out conspiracy” to disrupt the country during international engagements. Dar highlighted previous instances where PTI protests coincided with global events such as the SCO summit or visits from foreign dignitaries.The government has maintained that the protests disrupt national stability and tarnish Pakistan’s image on the global stage. However, PTI leaders, including Gandapur, remain steadfast, urging supporters not to relent until Imran Khan is released.Contrary to earlier announcements, Bushra Bibi, Imran Khan’s wife, joined the protestors, energizing the crowd with brief remarks. From her vehicle, she expressed frustration over delays caused by logistical hurdles, urging supporters to stay in their vehicles to expedite the march.Her presence marks a significant moment in the PTI's protest movement, showcasing the party's determination to persevere despite setbacks.The ongoing protest and internet disruptions highlight the growing divide in Pakistan's political landscape. On one side, PTI supporters demand transparency, justice, and Khan's release, while the government asserts its measures are aimed at maintaining stability and fostering international relations.The lack of clear communication about internet disruptions and the heavy-handed imposition of Section 144 underscore the challenges of balancing national security with democratic freedoms.

An advocate for major social media platforms recently addressed an Australian Senate committee, urging lawmakers to delay proposed laws that would ban children under 16 from using popular social media sites. The call for postponement was made amid concerns that the legislation should not be rushed through Parliament without a clearer understanding of how new age-verification technologies would function. The bill has sparked significant debate between the digital industry and lawmakers focused on children’s safety online.Sunita Bose, the managing director of the Digital Industry Group Inc. (DIGI), a lobby group representing social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, was questioned by the Senate committee. Bose emphasized that the Australian government should wait until June to pass the bill, allowing time for the completion of a government-commissioned review of age-assurance technologies.Bose argued that Parliament is being asked to pass a bill without a full understanding of how these technologies would work to verify users’ ages. “Parliament is being asked to pass a bill this week without knowing how it will work,” she said, noting that the evaluation could provide critical insights into the practical implementation of these technologies. She stressed the importance of delaying the decision to ensure that the government has a thorough understanding of the issues at hand before passing a bill that could have wide-reaching effects on children’s online access.The proposed legislation, if passed, would impose hefty fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (approximately $33 million) on social media platforms that fail to prevent children under 16 from creating accounts. This would be a significant regulatory move, as it would directly hold digital platforms accountable for ensuring their users meet the required age thresholds. The bill is expected to pass with bipartisan support, with its implementation scheduled for one year after the law is enacted. This grace period would allow platforms time to adjust and develop the necessary technological solutions to meet the age verification requirements.Communications Minister Michelle Rowland has expressed strong support for the proposed legislation, highlighting that the government’s primary concern is protecting children from the dangers of social media. Rowland has stated that social media, in its current form, is not safe for children, and the bill aims to empower parents to restrict their children’s access to these platforms.She emphasized that “Social media in its current form is not a safe product for them,” arguing that childhood should not be defined by exposure to social media, with its associated pressures such as constant notifications, endless scrolling, and unrealistic expectations set by influencers. This stance aligns with broader concerns about the harmful effects of social media on young people’s mental health and overall well-being.Bose responded to questioning from lawmakers, expressing concerns about the potential negative consequences of banning children from mainstream social media platforms. She warned that such a move could inadvertently isolate children and drive them toward less regulated and more dangerous online spaces. These alternative platforms, which are not subject to the same scrutiny as major social media sites, could expose children to even greater risks.This concern highlights the complexity of the issue, with Bose suggesting that instead of outright bans, the focus should be on improving safety and increasing digital literacy to help children navigate online spaces responsibly. Bose believes that a more nuanced approach is needed to protect children without isolating them from the digital world entirely.The tension between Bose’s stance and that of several senators was evident during the hearing. Opposition Senator Ross Cadell, for example, pressed Bose on how his 10-year-old stepson had been able to access accounts on platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube despite these platforms having a nominal age limit of 13. In response, Bose admitted that enforcement of age limits could be improved, acknowledging that the industry has not always been successful in keeping underage users off platforms.However, Bose’s statements did not sit well with some members of the committee. Senator Sarah Henderson called her argument “outrageous,” accusing Bose of defending the interests of tech companies rather than protecting children’s safety. This heated exchange illustrates the broader ideological divide in the debate, with some prioritizing child safety over the interests of digital platforms and others advocating for more gradual changes to avoid unintended consequences.Another key issue raised during the committee hearing was the role of algorithms in protecting children from harmful content online. Unaligned Senator Jacqui Lambie questioned why social media platforms do not use their algorithms more effectively to filter out harmful material that might be directed at children. Lambie criticized the platforms for their failure to address the negative impact of addictive algorithms that often keep children connected to platforms for longer periods of time, while also exposing them to harmful content, including material that promotes suicide and eating disorders.Bose responded by pointing out that platforms already have algorithms in place to protect children by filtering out explicit content such as nudity. However, she acknowledged that there is still room for improvement in these systems, and more investment is needed to ensure that algorithms are better equipped to address the growing issue of harmful online content.Further questioning focused on the financial aspects of social media platforms’ operations, with Senator Dave Sharma asking Bose how much revenue platforms generate from Australian children. Bose admitted that she was not familiar with the figures, which reflects a wider concern about the lack of transparency in the digital industry regarding how children’s data is monetized. This issue is particularly relevant given that a recent study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health revealed that social media platforms generated $11 billion in advertising revenue from U.S. users under 18 in 2022. These figures highlight the immense financial stakes involved and add weight to calls for greater regulation of social media platforms.Sarah Vandenbroek, an official from the Department of Communications, assured the committee that the government-commissioned evaluation of age-assurance technologies, due to report in June, would provide critical insights into the accuracy, security, and privacy of these systems. This evaluation will be key in determining the feasibility of the proposed law and addressing concerns about the privacy implications of verifying children’s ages online.James Chisholm, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Communications, expressed confidence in the proposed age limit, stating that the government believes the idea is both feasible and important for protecting children. He noted that consultations had taken place with industry stakeholders, and the government is committed to ensuring that any regulatory changes will be in the best interest of children while balancing the needs of the digital industry.","Sunita Bose is the managing director of the Digital Industry Group Inc.

Google faces $8.8 billion legal challenge in UK over search market practices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-faces-8-8-billion-legal-challenge-in-uk-over-search-market-practices/articleshow/115688383.cms,"Google (representative image)

The UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal has unanimously approved a massive £7 billion ($8.8 billion) class action lawsuit against Google , dealing a significant blow to the tech giant's market dominance and potentially reshaping digital advertising practices.Consumer rights advocate Nikki Stopford spearheaded the lawsuit, alleging that Google systematically exploits its search engine market position to inflate advertising costs, ultimately harming consumers across the United Kingdom. The tribunal's decision allows the case to proceed to trial, marking a critical moment in the ongoing global scrutiny of Google's business practices.Central to the lawsuit are two key accusations: first, that Google compels Android phone manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Chrome browsers, and second, that the company pays billions to Apple to remain the default search engine on Safari . These practices, Stopford argues, create an anti-competitive environment that artificially drives up advertising expenses.The lawsuit is structured as an opt-out collective action, meaning all UK consumers aged 16 and over who purchased goods or services from businesses using Google's search advertising are automatically included unless they choose to exclude themselves.This legal challenge is part of a broader international pattern of regulatory and judicial actions against Google. In the United States, a district judge has already ruled Google a monopoly, with potential consequences including the forced sale of Chrome. The European Union has similarly upheld a €2.4 billion antitrust fine against the company.Google maintains its innocence, with UK senior counsel Paul Colpitts stating that ""people use Google because it is helpful; not because there are no alternatives."" However, the mounting legal pressures suggest significant challenges ahead for the tech behemoth.","The UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal has unanimously approved a massive £7 billion ($8.8 billion) class action lawsuit against Google.

Miyazaki criticises AI for lacking the emotional depth of true animation



Miyazaki’s $50 million net worth driven by Ghibli’s success



Miyazaki’s ongoing legacy ensures long-term financial success

Miyazaki’s films, especially those created under the Studio Ghibli banner, have garnered international acclaim and earned hundreds of millions in revenue. Notably, Spirited Away, which Miyazaki directed, became the highest-grossing Japanese film at the time of its release, earning over $275 million globally. Spirited Away, like other Ghibli productions, Princess Mononoke and Howl's Moving Castle, produced after it, cemented Studio Ghibli as an undisputed giant in the global animation market.Besides box office collections, Studio Ghibli has generated huge revenues from other sources like DVD sales, product merchandising, and streaming rights online. These revenues, in different forms, have provided the studio and its co-founder with enough ease to spend a couple of years in advance.OpenAI then made ChatGPT available with improved features to be optimized at producing images looking like a wide variety of styles, even the masterpieces of the great maestros such as Hayao Miyazaki. Social media was swamped all through the night with AI-created pieces of art chillingly similar to the vintage Studio Ghibli style. It has brought wonder and outrage in about equal proportions, with some fans welcoming the new styles of art, but others, even Miyazaki himself, being adamant in their refusal.Miyazaki has long been vocal about his distaste for artificial intelligence, referring to it as ""an insult to life itself."" His criticism stems from the belief that AI, despite its advanced capabilities, cannot replicate the true emotions and human experiences that underlie traditional animation. Miyazaki’s films, known for their emotional depth and intricate storytelling, are grounded in the human experience—something he feels AI cannot fully comprehend or replicate.""I was not able to sit here and have fun enjoying this sort of thing and having a good time,"" Miyazaki told an interviewer. ""The person who does so does not even realize what pain is. I am ill. If you want to make so many bad things, go ahead and make them. I would not even consider using this technology myself to such a degree.""This reflects his deep belief in the uniqueness of human creativity, which he feels AI lacks.As of 2025, the net worth of Hayao Miyazaki was estimated at $50 million, a huge amount of money within the animation industry. His riches are mostly gained from the financial success and worldwide popularity of Studio Ghibli. Although not as lucrative financially as big businesses like Disney, the financial success of Miyazaki is staggering considering other leaders in the field like Walt Disney or Nick Park.Studio Ghibli’s revenue is not limited to box office earnings alone; the studio’s ability to monetize its films through various media and product sales has contributed significantly to Miyazaki’s wealth. This enduring success has allowed him to remain one of the most financially successful figures in animation.Miyazaki’s films continue to be a significant cultural and financial force even years after their initial releases. Movies like Howl’s Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke continue to bring in revenue, thanks to their popularity on streaming platforms and through various merchandise sales. These films’ lasting appeal ensures that Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli remain financially prosperous long after the initial box office run.While all his other retirement announcements, Miyazaki's return to the world of animation has been welcome with every step. In 2013, after announcing his retirement with the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki returned to embark on a new venture, How Do You Live?, to show that the power of his imagination and passion are never spent.","Miyazaki’s films, especially those created under the Studio Ghibli banner, have garnered international acclaim and earned hundreds of millions in revenue.

"Ghibli-style AI art is 'melting' GPUs: After ChatGPT maker CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI's Rohan Sahai says you may see ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ghibli-style-ai-art-is-melting-gpus-after-chatgpt-maker-ceo-sam-altman-openais-rohan-sahai-says-you-may-see-/articleshow/119723766.cms,"Representative image

When ChatGPT turned everything into Studio Ghibli art

Ghibli-style AI art 'melting' GPUs saga continues. Just days ago, the excitement surrounding ChatGPT’s enhanced and user-friendly image generation features prompted OpenAI to impose a temporary cap on requests. In a Twitter update, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote just a say after GPT-4o was rolled out, ""It’s awesome to see people enjoying images in ChatGPT, but our GPUs are overheating. We’re rolling out some temporary rate limits while we optimize things—shouldn’t take too long! Soon, the free tier of ChatGPT will get 3 generations daily."" While Altman didn’t detail the specifics of the limit, he expressed hope that it would be a short-term measure as OpenAI works to manage the demand deluge more efficiently.Days later, the GPU ""meltdown"" narrative continues with a fresh update. This time from Rohan Sahai , product lead for Sora—OpenAI’s video generation tool built by the ChatGPT team. OpenAI Sora, which crafts videos from text, images, and video inputs, too seems to be feeling the 'heat'. Sahai tweeted, ""The demand for 4o image generation has been unreal. It’s been a blast watching the Sora feed overflow with amazing creations. Sadly, our GPUs are frying in Sora territory too, so expect longer wait times or capacity hiccups in the days ahead. We’re hustling to get things back on track.""Sahai quoted CEO Altman’s earlier post about Ghibli-style AI art straining OpenAI’s systems. The company is reportedly tapping its GPT-4o model to power this upgraded image generation tool, yielding visuals that are strikingly lifelike—though users can steer them in countless creative directions. The model has also tackled previous challenges, like rendering text, with notable success.The Ghibli AI art phenomenon kicked off earlier this week when ChatGPT began transforming everything into Studio Ghibli-inspired art. OpenAI’s “Images for ChatGPT” feature nails depth, shadows, and even text with eerie precision, sparking a wave of users mimicking Hayao Miyazaki’s iconic Studio Ghibli style. Already a widespread favorite online for its soothing, gentle vibe (think Lofi Girl), this aesthetic has now become an effortless, automated trend.Predictably, the craze quickly spiraled into wild territory. Internet users have reimagined everything from the Twin Towers on 9/11 and JFK’s assassination to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang signing a woman’s chest, Sam Altman’s congressional testimony, and even the Babri Masjid demolition -- all infused with Ghibli’s signature charm. Altman has leaned into the hype, swapping his Twitter profile picture for a Ghibli-fied version of himself and inviting followers to craft him a new one.Interestingly, the rules for Images with ChatGPT allow this kind of experimentation. Per the GPT-4o system card, “The model can mimic the look of certain artists’ styles when their names are included in prompts.” It includes a safeguard: Requests to replicate the style of living artists are blocked. However, as 'The Verge' points out that it is worth noting that Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli is still alive.","Ghibli-style AI art craze is straining OpenAI's systems.

European Commission announces 1.3 billion euros investment in AI



The German government has signaled a strong response to potential US tariffs, indicating that “nothing is off the table” when considering harsh measures, including potential actions targeting US tech companies. This announcement comes as the European Commission unveiled a significant 1.3 billion euro (approx $1.4 billion) investment in artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity and digital skills, aimed at bolstering European tech sovereignty.According to a report by news agency Reuters, a German government spokesperson, addressing concerns over potential US tariffs, stated that all options are being considered. When specifically questioned about the possibility of countermeasures affecting US tech firms, the spokesperson said that “at the moment, nothing is off the table, but instead everything is being looked at.”The spokesperson emphasised that any decisions regarding countermeasures would be made collectively within the European Union.“Decisions must be made jointly and in consideration of the costs and benefits within the European Union and under the leadership of the European Commission - this process is under way,” the spokesperson added.This stance from Germany coincides with the European Commission's announcement of an investment in digital technologies. The Digital Europe Programme for 2025 to 2027 will allocate 1.3 billion euros to strengthen the EU's capabilities in AI, cybersecurity and digital skills, a separate report by Reuters said.European Commission digital chief Henna Virkkunen explained the strategic intent behind this investment, stating, “Securing European tech sovereignty starts with investing in advanced technologies and in making it possible for people to improve their digital competences.”","German government indicates that 'nothing is off the table' when considering harsh measures, including potential actions targeting US tech companies.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy.""

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said that the legitimate people, as a result of the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will receive more social security, not less. Musk along with other members of DOGE recently sat for an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier.

He suggested this could lead to errors in benefit distribution. Earlier this month, he announced that DOGE has cleaned up the dead people database of “approximately 3.2 million numberholders, all listed age 120+”.During the latest interview, Musk emphasized that the distribution entitlement fraud is a “big one to eliminate”. He stated: ""If a commercial company is operated the way the federal government does, then it would immediately go bankrupt. It would be delisted. The officers would be arrested.""","Elon Musk recently sat for an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier.

What went wrong at Pat Gelsinger’s Intel

Intel finds its new CEO, and he wants to do things differently than Gelsinger



Last year, Intel 's board abruptly ended Pat Gelsinger 's turnaround attempt, cutting short what he believed would be a five-year transformation of the semiconductor giant. ""I wasn't done with the five-plus years when the board made a directional change,"" Gelsinger told reporters, revealing his frustration with a tenure that saw the company's market position dramatically erode.Gelsinger had pitched a five-plus year plan to turnaround Intel when he joined the chipmaker. However, just three years into his tenure, Gelsinger was given an ultimatum by the board after it lost the confidence, either to announce his retirement or face removal. Gelsinger ultimately chose retirement, bringing his tumultuous tenure, marked by what some analysts called significant strategic missteps, to an end with a bittersweet acknowledgement that the company had been ""his life for the bulk of his working career.""Under his leadership, Intel's revenue plummeted to $54 billion in 2023, nearly one-third below 2021 levels. The company reported its first annual net loss since 1986, with its stock crashing 66% from its peak during Gelsinger's early months as CEO.Failures plagued Gelsinger's strategy. He missed crucial opportunities in the artificial intelligence market, allowing competitors like Nvidia to dominate. A diplomatic blunder with TSMC , where he questioned Taiwan's stability, cost Intel a valuable manufacturing partnership. The company's ambitious 18A chip manufacturing process encountered significant obstacles, with early tests revealing poor chip quality and potential customers like Apple and Qualcomm declining to use the technology.Enter Lip-Bu Tan , Intel's new CEO, who brings a markedly different approach. Where the general consensus is that Gelsinger struggled with bloated management and slow decision-making, Tan is planning aggressive restructuring. He aims to streamline the company's workforce, particularly targeting what he sees as an inefficient middle management layer.Tan's initial strategy focuses on revitalizing Intel Foundry and pursuing more aggressive AI chip production . He plans to improve manufacturing efficiency and actively court new customers like Microsoft and Amazon. Unlike Gelsinger's broad, sometimes unfocused approach, Tan intends to make ""tough decisions"" to position Intel competitively in the rapidly evolving semiconductor landscape.Meanwhile, Gelsinger has found a new home in venture capital, joining Playground Global as a general partner. He's already exploring deep-tech investments and serving as executive chair of portfolio company xLight,","Pat Gelsinger's five-year plan to turnaround Intel was abruptly ended last year.

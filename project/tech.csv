Samsung may bring first tri-fold phone to US this year: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-may-bring-first-tri-fold-phone-to-us-this-year-report/articleshow/124002405.cms,"Representative image

“A much larger screen than before”

Betting on foldables





Samsung is considering releasing its upcoming “tri-fold” smartphone in the United States later this year, marking the first time such a device would be available in the market, according to a CNN Business report. Samsung is still weighing which markets to launch the device in, but the US is part of those discussions, a person familiar with the company’s plans told the publication. Notably, Samsung has often limited new product lines to certain regions, such as South Korea and China. For instance, last year it released the Galaxy Z Fold 6 SE only in those countries.Chinese rival Huawei already sells a tri-folding phone, but the company does not operate in the US market. If Samsung proceeds, it would make the device the first tri-fold smartphone available to American consumers.The tri-fold is expected to fold in two places, offering a display larger than Samsung’s current foldables. “I think what we’re seeing is a bit more of a return to life before (the smartphone),” said Drew Blackard, senior vice president of mobile product management for Samsung Electronics America, in an interview with CNN.“When older cell phones had different forms and people wanted a variety of options.”Minseok Kang, Samsung’s global head of smartphone product planning, told the publication that the 2025 launch timeline is on track. Kang described the new form factor as the next step in a product strategy that has already seen strong demand for the Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold, which together saw a 25% increase in preorders compared to their predecessors. The Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung’s latest foldable, unfolds to an eight-inch screen.Samsung has teased tri-folding prototypes at trade shows, including the Flex G and Flex S concepts. The upcoming phone would mark the first time those designs are translated into a commercial product.“I think… the exciting part is getting it out into the wild and then ultimately seeing what different users are attracted to,” Blackard told CNN.Analysts say the tri-fold could remain a niche, high-priced device like Samsung’s existing Fold lineup. But it could help the company stand apart from rivals, especially as Apple prepares to launch its iPhone Air this week and reportedly develops its own foldable phone for 2026.","The tri-fold is expected to fold in two places, offering a display larger than Samsung’s current foldables.

Leaner team, sharper focus







In a strategic move Softbank group will reportedly layoff 20% of its Vision Fund workforce. As reported by Reuters, the internal memo the will is firing 20% of its workforce form the Vision Fund division. This move of the company marks the return to founder Masayoshi Son’s signature high-risk, high-reward investment style—this time focused squarely on artificial intelligence. As per Reuters, the fresh round of layoffs will impact 60 employees of the global team. Unlike previous reductions triggered by mounting losses, this round follows the fund’s strongest quarterly performance since June 2021, buoyed by gains in public holdings such as Nvidia and Coupang. “We continually adjust the organization to best execute our long-term strategy—making bold, high-conviction investments in AI and breakthrough technologies,” a Vision Fund spokesperson told Reuters.This restructuring at Softbank signals a decisive shift away from Vision Fund’s sprawling startup portfolio toward capital-intensive AI infrastructure. As per the report, Softbank founder Son is now moving the resources into a handful of massive bets such as $30 billion investment in OpenAI, $6,5 billion acquisition of chip designer Ampere Computing and $500 billion in Stargate project which is a joint venture of OpenAI and Oracle.The report also suggests the Son is also pursuing $1 trillion AI industrial park in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.As per Reuters report, the fresh round of layoffs indicate that with fewer teams and narrower focus, the Vision Fund will need less number of investment advisers. At its peak in 2020, the fund employed 474 people; today, that number has shrunk by nearly 40%.The layoffs also reflect on Son’s belief that the next wave of tech will be driven by AI models, semiconductors, and data infrastructure—not broad venture capital plays. SoftBank has already taken stakes in Intel, Nvidia, and acquired chip firms Graphcore and Ampere Computing, aiming to build a full-stack AI ecosystem.","Softbank group will reportedly layoff 20% of its Vision Fund workforce.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk . The pay package has drawn fresh criticism, this time from Pope Leo XIV, who warned it reflects dangerous levels of inequality in society. In a media interview, published by Crux last week as part of a new biography by Senior Correspondent Elise Ann Allen, the Pope said such outsized compensation highlights the widening gap between workers and corporate executives.“Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world.

US and China reach “framework” deal to save TikTok from ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-and-china-reach-framework-deal-to-save-tiktok-from-ban/articleshow/123913556.cms,"Trump administration claims victory ahead of looming deadline

Questions remain over algorithm control and congressional approval





The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership, potentially averting a ban of the popular social media app just days before a September 17 deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the preliminary deal during trade talks in Madrid, saying President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will finalize the agreement in a Friday phone call.The framework would shift ownership of TikTok's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance to American investors, addressing national security concerns that have dominated the app's future for years. While Bessent declined to reveal commercial terms, calling it a deal ""between two private parties,"" he emphasized the agreement protects US security interests while preserving what Chinese negotiators consider the app's cultural characteristics.Trump celebrated the breakthrough on Truth Social, writing that ""a deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""The announcement comes after months of negotiations and three deadline extensions since Trump took office, with the current ban scheduled to take effect Wednesday if no agreement is reached.Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang confirmed the two sides reached a ""basic framework consensus"" on resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation. However, he warned the US against continued ""suppression"" of Chinese companies while seeking Chinese accommodation on American concerns.Critical details remain unresolved, including whether ByteDance will transfer control of TikTok's valuable recommendation algorithm that drives user engagement. Chinese officials previously expressed reluctance to export the algorithm technology, which Beijing considers strategically sensitive. Wang Jingtao from China's cyberspace regulator suggested the deal could involve licensing intellectual property rights rather than full transfer.Any final agreement may require approval from Congress, which passed bipartisan legislation in 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban due to national security fears. The law, upheld by the Supreme Court, prohibits companies from ""foreign adversary"" countries from owning more than 20 percent of the platform.Industry analysts expect Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally whose company currently hosts TikTok's US data, to lead the American investor group. TikTok serves approximately 170 million US users, making it one of the most significant social media platforms in the country.","The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership.

“Time is too precious”: Warren Buffett explains why he won’t upgrade his 11-year-old car,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/time-is-too-precious-warren-buffett-explains-why-he-wont-upgrade-his-11-year-old-car/articleshow/124000708.cms,"Time over money



A lesson in simplicity







Most of the billionaires often flaunt their luxury lifestyle by showing off their expensive cars as a status symbol, however, Warren Buffett does not believe in this show off. The billionaire loves his 11-year old car and treats it like a kitchen appliance. At 94, the legendary investor drives a 2014 Cadillac XTS—complete with hail damage—because, in his words, “a half a day I don’t want to give up” is too steep a price for car shopping. Buffett’s approach towards not buying a car is not new. At the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in 2001, Buffett explained that simplicity and safety matters the most to him and not style. His present Cadillac, which was purchased by his daughter Susie Buffett, reflects that ethos. Susie purchased the car from Huber Cadillac in Omaha, posing as a regular customer. Later Buffett praised the dealership in a letter to GM CEO Mary Barra for treating her fairly—without knowing she was buying for one of the world’s richest men.Buffett views of still using the 11-year old car is rooted in his philosophy that time is the most valuable asset. “If I could write a check in 30 seconds and be in the same position I’m in now with a newer car, I’d be glad to do it this afternoon,” he once said.“But I don’t like to trade away when there’s really no benefit to me at all.”Every year he drives around 3,500 miles a year and despite some occasional nudges from his daughter to upgrade, he remains content. To Buffett, cars are about utility, safety, and efficiency—not prestige.As reported by Cox Automotive’s 2023 Car Buyer Journey Study, most of the Americans spend around 12 to 14 hours in buying a car. Buffett’s decision of delegating the task to her daughter underscores the belief that those hours can be spent in reading, investing and thinking.His investing philosophy mirrors his driving habits: buy quality, hold long, and avoid unnecessary churn. “I’m totally happy with the car,” he said in 2001—and he’s still proving it today, behind the wheel of a Cadillac that’s weathered more than just Nebraska hailstorms.","Warren Buffett drives an 11-year-old Cadillac XTS.

iPhone 17 Pro Max: The Price Is Insane, But the Tech Is Better





iPhone 17 series is now available worldwide, including in China – a country where it has witnessed some turbulent times when it comes to sales. However, reports suggest that the launch of the iPhone 17 series in Apple’s one of the biggest markets appears to be off to a promising start, with hundreds of people lining up at Apple’s flagship store in Beijing on Friday to pick up their new phones.According to a report by news agency Reuters, approximately 300 customers arrived at the store in the Sanlitun area, signaling strong initial demand in the world's second-largest economy. Among the customers was 35-year-old Shuke Wang, who purchased the iPhone 17 Pro Max, a model analysts believe will be the best-selling device in the new series.Wang noted that while he liked the redesign and the look of the new ultra-thin iPhone Air, he ultimately chose the Pro Max for its longer battery life.Not only long queues but also the fact that iPhone 17 series broke pre-order records in China, surpassing the previous year's iPhone 16 launch also suggest that Apple’s craze is still high in China. According to the South China Morning Post, pre-orders on the e-commerce platform JD.com exceeded the entire first-day volume of the iPhone 16 within just one minute of going live.The overwhelming demand led to technical issues, with customers reporting website crashes and payment delays of up to five minutes on Apple's official site.For the iPhone 17 Pro Max, all in-person pickup slots at Shanghai's Apple Stores were fully booked within 20 minutes, and delivery delays for customers in Guangzhou now extend into October. The standard iPhone 17 with 256GB storage proved to be the most popular model.This record-breaking performance highlights Apple's strong brand loyalty in China. According to analysts, the iPhone 17 series could provide a crucial boost to Apple's market share in China, which has faced pressure from increasing competition with companies like Huawei and Xiaomi.Omdia senior analyst Chiew Le Xuan stated that he expects iPhone shipments in China to rise by 11% year-over-year in the second half of the year, driven by the new series. He added that the iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to become Apple’s top-performing model in the Chinese market in 2026.Despite the strong launch, Apple still faces challenges in the Chinese market.

Intel's carefully worded statements about Arc GPU survival raise red flags about the graphics division's true future as Nvidia's $5 billion investment reshapes the partnership landscape. While Intel publicly insists its Arc graphics cards will continue alongside the new Nvidia partnership, the company's evasive language suggests a more complicated reality behind closed doors.Intel told PCWorld that ""the collaboration is complementary to Intel's roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings""—but notably avoided specifics about timeline, investment levels, or long-term commitment to discrete graphics development.The carefully parsed statement sidesteps critical questions: Will Intel maintain full funding for Arc development when Nvidia can provide superior graphics solutions? How does continuing expensive GPU research make financial sense for a company that recently cut thousands of jobs and divested multiple divisions?Industry observers note the messaging feels deliberately vague. Terms like ""complementary"" and ""continue to have GPU product offerings"" leave significant wiggle room for scaling back operations or eventually phasing out Arc entirely.Yesterday's Nvidia partnership announcement revealed that RTX graphics chiplets will be integrated directly into Intel processors, potentially making standalone Arc cards redundant for most consumers. The collaboration explicitly targets AMD's growing market share through combined CPU-GPU products—exactly the strategy Intel's Arc division has been pursuing independently.The timing raises additional concerns. Intel's Arc B580 recently gained positive reviews, and upcoming Battlemage and Celestial architectures showed promise. Yet the Nvidia deal emerged just as Arc momentum was building, suggesting internal strategic shifts that Intel isn't publicly acknowledging.What Intel isn't saying may be more revealing than its official statements: whether Arc GPUs represent a continued priority or simply existing inventory and contractual obligations playing out while Nvidia assumes graphics responsibilities.The truth likely lies in Intel's upcoming quarterly guidance and R&D allocation decisions.",Intel's carefully worded statements about Arc GPU survival raise red flags about the graphics division's true future.

Jensen Huang: AI should be democratized

Nvidia’s Jensen Huang praises Google Gemini Nano Banana





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently opened up about his personal use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, saying he switches between platforms depending on the tasks. Speaking at an interview in London recently, Huang said that among Elon Musk ’s Grok, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google’s Gemini, his favorite “depends on what I’m doing”. Explaining further, the Nvidia CEO said “For something more technical I will use Gemini. If I’m doing something where it’s a bit more artistic, I prefer Grok. If it’s very fast information access I prefer Perplexity—it does a really good job of presenting research to me. And for near everyday use I enjoy using ChatGPT”.“When I am doing something serious, I will give the same prompt to all of them, and then I ask them to, because it’s research oriented, critique each other’s work. Then I take the best one,” Huang continues.This comes despite Nvidia’s partnership with OpenAI along with Microsoft, Softbank, Arm and Oracle to build data centers, secure energy and power infrastructure and deploy millions of AI chips in the US.Calling AI “the single greatest opportunity for us to close the technology divide”, Jensen Huang called for the democratization of AI. During the conversation, he said:“AI should be democratized for everyone. There should be no person who is left behind, it’s not sensible to me that someone should be left behind on electricity or the internet of the next level of technology”.During the same conversation, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised Google Gemini’s latest AI tool – Nano Banana. “How could anyone not love Nano Banana? I mean Nano Banana, how good is that? Tell me it’s not true,” he said, adding “Tell me it’s not true! It’s so good. I was just talking to Demis [Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind] yesterday and I said ‘How about that Nano Banana! How good is that?’”",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has opened up about his personal use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. He said he switches between platforms depending on the tasks.

XElectron Techno Review: Turn Any Wall Into a 200-Inch Screen





Hours after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment into the US-based chipmaker, Intel’s stock surged by 23% on Thursday (September 18), marking its biggest single-day gain since 1987 – for the first time in 38 years. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang celebrated the deal as a “fusion of two world-class platforms” and they will work together to develop custom products.Nvidia will integrate Intel’s custom CPUs into its AI infrastructure and Intel will integrate Nvidia's graphics processors into the chip systems it sells to PC customers.The partnership comes after years of Intel losing ground to rivals like Nvidia in the chipmaking industry. Back in 2005, then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini tried to convince his board to acquire Nvidia, predicting that graphics chips would one day revolutionise data centres.However, the directors were hesitant about the high price and Intel’s poor acquisition history. They chose to back an internal project called Larrabee instead, which was ultimately a failure.This decision created a huge opportunity for Nvidia. While Intel continued to focus on traditional processors, Nvidia correctly anticipated the rise of AI.They developed specialised chips perfect for machine learning, long before ChatGPT became a household name. As a result, when tech giants began racing to build AI infrastructure, they turned to Nvidia’s ready-made solutions.The stock spike also brings Intel's year-to-date return to 52%. Nvidia's shares also rose by 3.5% on Thursday.The investment of $5 billion, which is awaiting regulatory approval, could make Nvidia one of Intel’s largest shareholders. It follows a separate agreement in August where the US government committed to investing $8.9 billion in Intel for a 9.9% stake.Dan Ives, a tech research analyst at Wedbush, called the partnership a ""game changer deal for Intel,"" which brings the company ""front and center into the AI game.""","Intel's stock surged by 23% on Thursday (September 18), marking its biggest single-day gain since 1987 – for the first time in 38 years.

Microsoft's cultural crisis amid AI transformation

Satya Nadella is worried of Microsoft missing another platform shift





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed during an internal town hall that he's ""haunted"" by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), a once-dominant computer company that disappeared after missing critical technology shifts. Speaking to employees last week, Nadella used DEC's downfall as a cautionary tale about Microsoft's own survival in the AI era, according to The Verge.DEC ruled the minicomputer world in the early 1970s with its PDP series but became irrelevant after making strategic errors, including betting on its proprietary VAX architecture instead of emerging RISC technology. The company faced fierce competition from IBM and others, ultimately leading to its demise. Nadella's first computer was ironically a VAX machine, and he had once dreamed of working at DEC.""Our industry is full of case studies of companies that were great once, that just disappeared,"" Nadella told employees, acknowledging that ""some of the biggest businesses we've built might not be as relevant going forward.""The CEO's comments came as employee morale hits ""all-time lows,"" with workers describing Microsoft as feeling ""colder, more rigid, and lacking in empathy.""The company has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs, including 9,000 job cuts in July, as part of what Nadella calls ""renewal"" for the AI transition.Nadella admitted the leadership team ""can do better"" but provided few specifics on addressing cultural concerns. The Verge reports that dozens of employees have expressed similar sentiments about the company's deteriorating workplace atmosphere.Microsoft previously missed the mobile revolution, which Bill Gates called his ""greatest mistake ever."" Now, with AI potentially threatening core products like Office suite—which generates one-fifth of annual revenue—Nadella warns that ""some of the margin that we love today might not be there tomorrow.""""All the categories that we may have even loved for 40 years may not matter,"" he cautioned, emphasising that companies must earn their right to exist daily by providing socially useful marketplace value. The specter of DEC serves as his constant reminder of what happens when tech giants fail to adapt.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used Digital Equipment Corporation's downfall as a cautionary tale about Microsoft's own survival in the AI era.

David Sacks recently shared a post on X, urging the Trump administration to update export control policies. In the post, the AI Czar highlighted two incidents from the recent past to make his case. One such incident was Huawei introducing a new chip to rival US chipmaker Nvidia and the other included the Chinese government instruction to the Chinese companies to stop buying certain Nvidia AI chips. These developments, Sacks said, indicate that “China is not desperate for our chips. It is producing its own, and intends to compete globally in the semiconductor market.”In the post, he continues saying that while Nvidia still has a substantial lead, “but Huawei is using its networking prowess to remain competitive”.“In particular, Huawei compensates for weaker individual chips by clustering more chips together,” David Sacks said.In the X post, Sacks said that it is time for the Trump administration to “update its assumptions with regard to export controls.” He urged the government to allow US chip companies to sell the “American technology stack abroad, albeit with security requirements, else we forfeit the AI race to China”.“If we refuse to do business with a country, we push it into China’s arms,” he warned.“The question of what we sell China will always be complicated, and there’s room for a wide range of opinions on that. But the question of whether we sell to the rest of the world, especially our friends and allies, should be an easy one,” he further warned.“Excessive bureaucratic delays are a gift for Huawei, which will fill out purchase orders as American companies fill out forms. The hawkish position with respect to China is to help American companies win the AI race, not to help Huawei create a Digital Silk Road,” he concluded.","David Sacks recently shared a post on X, urging the Trump administration to update export control policies.

Expanding into the PC market





Nvidia is investing $5 billion in its struggling former takeover target and rescue Intel through a strategic chip partnership. The deal announced sees Nvidia purchasing Intel stock at $23.28 per share—a 6.5% discount—while the companies collaborate on PC and data center processors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has now explained why he decided to bet on Intel. As reported by Business Insider, Huang revealed that he still has confidence in the chipmaker’s turnaround. “We’re delighted to have invested in Intel, and the return on that investment is going to be fantastic,” Huang said at a Thursday press conference.This partnership will witness Intel integrate Nvidia’s GPU technology into its upcoming AI-powered PCs. On the other hand, Nvidia will adopt Intel’s x86 CPUs for its data centers. This will mark a shift in Nvidia’s sourcing strategy as the company relied on AMD and ARM for the CPUs. “We’re going to become a very large customer of Intel CPUs,” Huang added.This announcement from Nvidia comes at a time of political scrutiny of Intel which includes recent calls from US President Donald Trump for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation over alleged conflicts of interest.However, later Trump reversed the course and the episode drew attention to Intel’s challenges and its importance to U.S. industrial policy.Following the reversal, Intel attracted a wave of investment:Some analysts suggest Nvidia’s move aligns with Washington’s push to bolster domestic chip production and reduce reliance on China. “Partnering with a US-backed Intel strengthens Nvidia’s alignment with Washington’s industrial policy,” noted Brad Gastwirth of Circular Technology.Back in 2005, then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini pitched acquiring Nvidia to his board, recognizing that graphics chips might revolutionise data centers. Directors balked at the unprecedented price tag and Intel's poor acquisition track record, instead backing an internal project called Larrabee that burned hundreds of millions before collapsing in 2009.Nvidia seized the moment Intel missed. While Intel clung to traditional processors, Nvidia anticipated the AI revolution, developing specialised chips perfect for machine learning before ChatGPT made headlines. When tech giants raced to build AI infrastructure, they turned to Nvidia's ready-made solutions.Today, Nvidia approaches $200 billion in annual revenue—soon earning more each quarter than Intel generates yearly. Its data center business alone dwarfs entire chip companies.Huang’s investment of $5 billion also positions Nvidia to expand beyond its core GPU business into the personal computing space.

How about PCIe with shared memory up to and including virtual memory backed by flash to run leading edge AI models on regular hardware?”.Elon Musk replied to the post, saying “New Intel CEO @LipBuTan1 is great”.In a statement, Nvidia and Intel announced to jointly develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products that accelerate applications and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise and consumer markets.The companies will focus on seamlessly connecting Nvidia and Intel architectures using Nvidia NVLink — integrating the strengths of Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing with Intel’s leading CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem to deliver cutting-edge solutions for customers.For data centers, Intel will build Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. The investment is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals.",Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) saying “Excited to team up with my good friend Jensen to jointly develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products!” The post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word remark.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123993113,imgsize-23894,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musks-one-word-comment-on-intel-nvidia-partnership-calls-ceo-lip-bu-tan-great.jpg"
"Nvidia spends over $900 million to buy Enfabrica CEO, licence technology: Here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-spends-over-900-million-to-buy-enfabrica-ceo-licence-technology-heres-why/articleshow/123992318.cms,"Why Nvidia is paying millions to AI startup Enfabrica

Recent AI hiring by Meta, Google and others





Nvidia is ramping up its efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) by following a path that Meta and Google recently took — spending millions to secure top AI researchers. The chipmaker, known globally for its powerful GPUs, has reportedly struck a deal with an AI startup to bring its core team on board. According to a report by CNBC, Nvidia has shelled out over $900 million to hire employees of AI startup Enfabrica and its CEO Rochan Sankar. The report cites two people familiar with the matter who said that Nvidia is paying both in cash and stock in the transaction.The decision comes at a time when Nvidia is riding a wave of record growth driven by demand for its chips, which power AI models across the industry. However, the company appears keen to go beyond its role as a hardware supplier. By building an internal pool of researchers, Nvidia is aiming to cement itself as an end-to-end AI leader — combining chips, software, and cutting-edge model development.The AI startup Enfabrica that Nvidia is investing in comes with a rare advantage — a team of specialists trained in building and optimising advanced AI models. Founded in 2019, the AI startup says its technology can connect more than 100,000 GPUs together – a solution that could help Nvidia offer integrated systems around its chips so clusters can effectively serve as a single computer.By absorbing this expertise, Nvidia can accelerate its own projects and reduce reliance on external players.Nvidia has previously invested in Enfabrica as part of a $125 million series B round in 2023. However, the company did not disclose its valuation then.Nvidia’s move mirrors strategies deployed by Meta, Google and other Big Tech firms in recent years. Meta has consistently lured prominent academics with multimillion-dollar pay packages, while Google has built up DeepMind and Google Research by buying startups and bringing in high-profile teams. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have also been in the race, intensifying competition and driving salaries to unprecedented levels.","N Nvidia has reportedly shelled out over $900 million to hire employees of AI startup Enfabrica and its CEO Rochan Sankar.

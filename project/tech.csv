The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) is facing a tug-of-war between telecom operators and the tech industry as it seeks to tighten regulations against spam and online scams. At a recent open house discussion, telecom operators advocated for bringing OTT platforms and businesses under stricter regulatory oversight, arguing that these entities often contribute significantly to spam but escape accountability.However, the Broadband India Forum (BIF), representing tech companies, countered that OTT platforms are already regulated under the Information Technology Act and additional oversight by TRAI is unnecessary.The debate centers around the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, which are being reviewed to enhance spam prevention measures. Telcos emphasize that OTT platforms, which carry a substantial portion of commercial traffic, must be included in the regulatory framework to effectively combat spam.BIF, on the other hand, maintains that TCCCPR primarily applies to telecom service providers and not OTT platforms. Debashish Bhattacharya, senior deputy director-general at BIF, reportedly called the telco’s comments as “misplaced and legally untenable” and said the TCCCPR applied to access service providers and not OTT platforms.TRAI Chairman AK Lahoti acknowledged the diverse viewpoints and assured that the regulator would consider all perspectives while finalizing the new regulations. He also commended the telecom industry's efforts to curb spam.Telcos argue that all entities involved in communication services, including OTT platforms and telemarketers, should be held accountable for spam and bear the costs associated with unsolicited commercial communications (UCC). They point out that while they act as intermediaries, they are often solely responsible for financial penalties related to spam, despite the content being generated by others. “There should not be more subjective restrictions on telecom firms. PEs and telemarketers should be held accountable,” Vodafone Idea’s regulatory head Ambika Khurana said.To address this issue, telcos have proposed that telemarketers and business entities share the responsibility for spam and face financial penalties. They also emphasize the need for greater transparency in the message delivery chain to identify the origin and aggregation of spam messages.“There are disproportionate levels of financial disincentive on telcos. Accountability has to be levied on PEs and telemarketers and not only on telcos,” UK Srivastava, President at Reliance Jio added.Bharti Airtel regulatory head Rahul Vatts said when the issue is spam, how could there be a distinction wherein one platform where the message is coming is regulated but the other is not. “If you are really concerned about spam, you should be more than happy to willingly agree with Trai’s gold standard to curb spam,” Vatts argued, adding that “the IT rules do not specifically cover the point of UCC as there is a broad definition but nothing specific to UCC”.","The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is facing a tug-of-war between telecom operators and the tech industry.

Food delivery giant Zomato Ltd has been slapped with a significant tax demand by the Joint Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise, Thane Commissionerate, Maharashtra. The order alleges non-payment of goods and services tax (GST) on delivery charges for the period between October 29, 2019, and March 31, 2022. The total demand includes a GST liability of Rs 401.7 crore, an equal amount in penalty, and applicable interest, bringing the total to Rs 803.4 crore. This development has raised questions about compliance practices in the rapidly growing food delivery industry. Despite the setback, Zomato has vowed to contest the order, citing strong legal grounds.The tax demand order, dated November 12, 2024, was served to Zomato on December 12, 2024. According to Zomato's regulatory filing, the case revolves around alleged non-payment of GST on delivery charges. The total demand is broken down as follows:The demand highlights the GST liabilities related to delivery charges, a contentious area of taxation for businesses operating in the digital services ecosystem.In response to the demand, Zomato has expressed confidence in its case. The company stated in its regulatory filing:The company plans to challenge the order through the appropriate legal avenues, emphasizing its commitment to compliance and transparency.News of the tax demand had an immediate impact on Zomato’s stock performance. On December 12, 2024, Zomato's shares ended at Rs 284.90, marking a decline of Rs 6.90 or 2.36% on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Despite this drop, analysts are closely monitoring the situation to assess its long-term impact on the company’s financial health.This case sheds light on the regulatory scrutiny faced by food delivery platforms regarding tax compliance. Delivery charges, which form a significant component of the total revenue for companies like Zomato, are subject to evolving interpretations of GST laws. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for similar disputes involving other players in the industry.Despite the ongoing tax dispute, Zomato continues to strengthen its position in the market. Recently, the company replaced JSW Steel in the BSE Sensex, a testament to its growing significance in the Indian stock market. However, the resolution of this tax issue will be crucial for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring operational stability.","Zomato has been slapped with a significant tax demand by the Joint Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise, Thane Commissionerate, Maharashtra.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta turns heads with a surprising donation to Trump’s inaugural fund; can you guess the amount?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerbergs-meta-turns-heads-with-a-surprising-donation-to-trumps-inaugural-fund-can-you-guess-the-amount/articleshow/116253439.cms,"Meta’s $1 million contribution to Trump’s inaugural fund: Details and implications

Meta, the technology conglomerate led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg , has recently come under the spotlight for its $1 million donation to the inaugural fund of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. This significant contribution, initially reported by The Wall Street Journal, underscores Meta's efforts to foster a strategic relationship with the incoming administration. The move follows a private meeting between Zuckerberg and Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where discussions reportedly centered on congratulatory exchanges and relationship building. Given the tense history between Zuckerberg and Trump, particularly regarding accusations of political bias on Meta platforms, this donation reflects a notable shift in approach.Meta’s donation to Trump’s inaugural fund is part of a high-profile pattern among corporations aiming to establish goodwill with the new administration. Inaugural committees are known for offering exclusive benefits to donors contributing substantial amounts, with contributions often exceeding traditional campaign finance limits.While Meta has not provided detailed explanations for the donation, it follows a recent dinner meeting between Zuckerberg, Trump, and Senator Marco Rubio. A Meta spokesperson acknowledged the CEO’s gratitude for the invitation but refrained from elaborating on the motivations behind the financial support.Such donations often serve as a strategic gesture for corporations to align with political leaders and navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes. For Meta, the move could signal an attempt to ensure favorable policies and maintain its position in a rapidly evolving tech industry.The relationship between Mark Zuckerberg and Donald Trump has been far from smooth. Over the years, tensions have risen over allegations that Meta, formerly Facebook, censored conservative viewpoints. Trump has publicly criticized Zuckerberg on multiple occasions, accusing the platform of political interference during the 2020 election.Despite these challenges, Zuckerberg has taken steps to mend relations. In the past year, he reportedly held private conversations with Trump, including a call where he expressed admiration for Trump’s resilience after an incident at a Pennsylvania rally. However, Meta’s relationship with Trump hit a low point following the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021, when the platform banned Trump’s accounts. Although Trump’s accounts have since been reinstated, lingering animosities remain, with Trump previously calling for Zuckerberg to face legal consequences over perceived election-related interference.Meta’s donation to Trump’s inaugural fund highlights a shift toward a more neutral and strategic political stance. In a letter to Congress in August, Zuckerberg expressed regret over Meta’s past political activities, including its handling of electoral efforts during the 2020 election. He also revealed pressure from the Biden administration to moderate COVID-19-related content, a controversial issue that influenced Meta’s decision to distance itself from overt political alignments.The donation appears to be part of a broader effort to rebuild trust with political leaders across the spectrum. Zuckerberg is not alone in this endeavor, as other tech executives, including Apple’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai, have also engaged in outreach to ensure regulatory favor and safeguard their companies’ interests.Meta’s contribution is emblematic of the broader trend among Silicon Valley leaders to navigate the volatile political climate. As regulatory pressures mount on issues like antitrust, data privacy, and content moderation, companies are increasingly investing in political outreach to secure favorable outcomes.For Meta, the stakes are particularly high. With its vast influence over digital communications and advertising, the company faces scrutiny from both sides of the political aisle. The donation to Trump’s inaugural fund could be seen as an effort to neutralize criticism while ensuring that Meta remains a key player in shaping future policies.Meta’s $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural fund reflects a calculated move in the ever-evolving relationship between technology companies and political leaders. As Meta continues to navigate its complex history with Trump and other political figures, the effectiveness of this strategy remains uncertain. Whether this gesture will foster goodwill or spark further controversy will depend on how both the incoming administration and Meta handle their interactions in the coming years.By aligning itself with the Trump administration during this pivotal moment, Meta has taken a bold step toward redefining its political approach, signaling a readiness to adapt to changing dynamics in the tech and political arenas.","Meta, the technology conglomerate led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has recently come under the spotlight for its $1 million donation to the inaugural fund of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

Now I started 2024 talking about how we had a bunch of H100s that this was going to be a big year for open source AI and it has been. Llama has quickly become the most adopted model with more than 650 million downloads and it is starting to become an industry standard.

We have one more release for the year. Llama 3.3 is a new 70 billion parameter text model that performs about as well as our 405 billion parameter model but now it is easier and more efficient to run.

So, that is the last Llama 3 release. The next stop is Llama 4 and if we started the year talking about the size of our clusters for training Llama, I want to start to wrap the year by doing the same.

We just announced that we were building a 2 gigawatt plus data centre in Louisiana that we're going to use to train future versions of Llama.”

“I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack, he was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we were up 35 percent with youth.

And I used TikTok, so I can’t really, you know, I can’t totally hate it. It was very effective. But I will say this, if you do do that, something else is going to come along and take its place. And maybe that’s not fair. And really, what the judge actually said was that you can’t have Chinese companies. In other words, they have the right to ban it if you can prove that Chinese companies own it. That’s what the judge actually said.”

“I’m going to try and make it so that other companies don’t become an even bigger monopoly.”

Trump was against TikTok ban during election campaign

US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country. In a Sunday interview on Meet the Press, when questioned about TikTok's impending ban, Trump avoided committing to saving TikTok though he hinted that ByteDance should divest the platform.NBC’s Kristen Welker pressed Trump on whether he will act to protect the app, which faces expulsion from the U.S. unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it by January 19.“This week a federal court upheld a law that could result in TikTok being banned.

While he criticised the Biden administration’s support for the ban during his campaign, he previously advocated for TikTok’s removal during his last term in office.In recent months, Trump released a Truth Social video urging those who “want to save TikTok” to vote for him and said that banning the platform will only benefit Facebook, which he referred to as an “enemy of the people.”","US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country.

Google has unveiled its new quantum chip — Willow. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took off X (formerly) known as Twitter to announce the launch of the chip. “Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field. In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in <5 mins that would take a leading supercomputer over 10^25 years, far beyond the age of the universe(!),” said Pichai in a post on X.This announcement started an interesting exchange between Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk.Pichai took to X to announce the launch of Willow, describing it as achieving "" exponential error reduction and unprecedented computational speed."" He stated that Willow can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years. This breakthrough garnered a surprised yet enthusiastic response from Elon Musk, who simply tweeted ""Wow.""Pichai, seemingly referencing Musk's surprise, followed up by replying, “We should do a quantum cluster in space with Starship one day:)”. To this, Musk responded, “That will probably happen. Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II. In my opinion, we are currently only at <5% of Type I. To get to ~30%, we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.”“indeed. We should scale solar so much more, amazing that we keep looking at alternatives when the most obvious path is staring at our eyes, literally!,” said Pichai.The new ""Willow"" quantum chip demonstrates unprecedented error correction capabilities, a critical challenge that has stymied quantum computing researchers for decades. With 105 qubits, the chip can reduce computational errors exponentially as it scales up, a feat scientists have pursued since the 1990s.In a groundbreaking demonstration, Google's quantum researchers showed the Willow chip could complete a computational task in roughly five minutes that would require a classical supercomputer an estimated 10 septillion (10^25) years—far exceeding the known age of the universe.","Google's new quantum chip, Willow, can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years.

Donald Trump ‘undecided’ on TikTok ban

The US Justice Department is pushing back against TikTok’s attempts to stall a looming ban, just days after the company sought intervention from the country’s Supreme Court. The department urged a US appeals court to reject TikTok 's request to temporarily block a law requiring its Chinese parent company, ByteDance , to divest the popular video-sharing app by January 19.TikTok filed an emergency motion seeking to pause the law while it pursues a review by the Supreme Court. The company warned that without court intervention, the ban would ""shut down"" the platform for its over 170 million US users.However, the justice department argued that delaying the law would pose a “continuing threat to national security” due to continued Chinese control of TikTok, news agency Reuters reported.The department acknowledged that while the ban wouldn't immediately prevent users from accessing the app, it would eventually render it “unworkable” by prohibiting support and updates.This legal battle stems from a recent appeals court ruling upholding the law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban. TikTok has argued that the incoming Trump administration, which has expressed opposition to the ban, should have time to review the situation.US President-elect Donald Trump provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban at an interview by avoiding committing to saving TikTok though he hinted that ByteDance should divest the platform.When asked whether he will act to protect the app, Trump said, “This week a federal court upheld a law that could result in TikTok being banned. You said you're going to rescue TikTok when you get into office. Are you going to take steps to protect it?,"" Trump said in reply.The fate of TikTok now hangs in the balance, with US President Joe Biden potentially able to grant a 90-day extension to the divestiture deadline. However, it remains unclear if ByteDance can meet the requirements to qualify for such an extension.","The US Justice Department is pushing back against TikTok’s attempts to stall a looming ban.

Microsoft to take $800 million hit from this sudden U-turn by General Motors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-to-take-800-million-hit-from-this-sudden-u-turn-by-general-motors/articleshow/116244124.cms,"This is a representational image

Microsoft will absorb an $800 million financial blow following General Motors ' abrupt decision to terminate its Cruise autonomous vehicle program, the tech giant revealed in a regulatory filing Wednesday.The impairment charge, unexpected and not previously included in the company's quarterly guidance, will reduce Microsoft's second-quarter earnings per share by approximately 9 cents.Microsoft originally invested in Cruise during a $2 billion funding round in January 2021, joining GM, Honda , and other institutional investors in backing the ambitious robotaxi venture. At the time, the investment was part of a broader strategic partnership that included cloud computing and autonomous vehicle technology collaboration.GM's sudden retreat from the robotaxi market marks a dramatic shift from its earlier projections. Just a year ago, CEO Mary Barra had optimistically suggested the Cruise unit could generate $50 billion in annual revenue by decade's end. Now, the company has decided to discontinue the robotaxi business and redirect autonomous vehicle technologies toward its core personal car operations.Microsoft will record the financial charge in its second quarter, with the impact extending beyond the tech giant to other minority investors like Honda, which has also ceased funding its joint robotaxi venture.GM has spent nearly $10 billion on Cruise over a decade, ultimately determining the robotaxi business was not sustainable.","Microsoft will absorb an $800 million financial blow following General Motors'abrupt decision to terminate its Cruise autonomous vehicle program.

Will Google's Willow quantum computing chip means risk for Bitcoin? Here's what you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/will-googles-willow-quantum-computing-chip-means-risk-for-bitcoin-heres-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/116243566.cms,"What is making Bitcoin community jittery about Google Willow

Google has achieved a major breakthrough in quantum computing with the unveiling of its next-generation chip, Willow. According to Google, the Willow chip can solve intricate problems in under five minutes—calculations so complex they would take a supercomputer approximately 10 septillion years (10^25) to complete. Despite its extraordinary capabilities, experts have reassured that Bitcoin and other cryptographic systems remain secure.“The Willow chip is a major step on a journey that began over 10 years ago,” Hartmut Neven, VP engineering at Google said in a blog post. Neven is vice president of engineering at Google. He is the founder and manager of the Quantum Artificial Intelligence lab, said to be behind this breakthrough.Following the introduction of Willow, there have been murmurs that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be on the way out. Some are wondering: Could this new chip pose a threat to Bitcoin’s famously strong encryption?The crypto community's response to Willow's launch has been mixed. Some express concerns about long-term security risks, while others maintain that current quantum technology poses no immediate threat. Some experts suggest proactive measures, like freezing vulnerable holdings or implementing expiration dates for outdated cryptographic standards, as precautionary steps.While Willow represents a major advancement, it's not powerful enough to crack Bitcoin's encryption. Experts estimate that millions of qubits would be required to compromise Bitcoin's security, far surpassing Willow's current capacity of 105 qubits. Additionally, quantum computers need stable and error-free qubits over extended periods, a challenge that current technology, including Willow, hasn't fully addressed.https://x.com/LacasiaPablo/status/1866236477853880398Despite the hype surrounding quantum computing, Bitcoin's underlying cryptographic algorithms remain robust. Experts emphasize that Willow's capabilities, though impressive, are not sufficient to jeopardize Bitcoin's security.","Google has unveiled its next-generation quantum computing chip, Willow.

Kerala man loses Rs 4 crore in two-and-a-half months in a scam that started on WhatsApp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kerala-man-loses-rs-4-crore-in-two-and-a-half-months-in-a-scam-that-started-on-whatsapp/articleshow/116242924.cms,"Here’s what happened

Tips to avoid investment scams

Never download apps from unknown sources. Only download apps from official app stores.



Be wary of unsolicited investment offers. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.



Research any investment opportunity thoroughly before committing any money.



Do not share your financial information with anyone you don't know and trust.

A man from Kerala has become the victim of a cyber fraud, losing a staggering amount of Rs 4.05 crore over a two-and-a-half-month period. The scam reportedly originated through a message received on WhatsApp.The victim, a 45-year-old man from Tripunithura, received a message on WhatsApp from someone posing as a representative of a well-known financial services company. The message enticed him with the prospect of lucrative investment opportunities and high returns through share trading.As per the FIR seen by TOI, the victim was contacted via WhatsApp. The scammer claimed that the victim could earn huge profits by engaging in share trading through an app developed by the company. The scammer convinced the victim to invest in a fraudulent scheme by promising high returns and quick profits. The victim was lured into downloading the ""Br-Block Pro"" app, through which they made multiple payments.Between September 26th and December 9th, the victim made several payments to the fraudulent app, believing that their investment would generate returns. However, after several weeks of investing, the victim realised he couldn't withdraw any funds from the app. This prompted him to suspect foul play and ultimately led him to file a complaint with the cyber police. The Kerala police are currently investigating the case.","The victim, a 45-year-old man from Tripunithura, received a message on WhatsApp from someone posing as a representative of a well-known financial services company.

US Supreme Court rejects Nvidia’s appeal to dismiss shareholder’s securities fraud lawsuit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-supreme-court-rejects-nvidias-appeal-to-dismiss-shareholders-securities-fraud-lawsuit/articleshow/116240959.cms,"What shareholders have alleged against Nvidia

“The corporate Supreme Court bar, supported by the U.S. Chamber (of Commerce) and its allies, often tries to gin up nonexistent legal issues in an effort to curtail class actions. We hope the court will think twice the next time a corporation uses the same playbook,”

The US Supreme Court has dismissed Nvidia's appeal in a securities fraud lawsuit. This will allow the company’s shareholders to proceed with their case against the AI chipmaker. The lawsuit accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its dependence on the cryptocurrency market. The court declined to intervene in the legal dispute, leaving a lower court's ruling in place that permitted the 2018 class action lawsuit to move forward.The lawsuit focuses on whether Nvidia violated the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act , a 1995 law aimed at preventing frivolous lawsuits. The Supreme Court's dismissal came without explanation, the report noted.During the hearing, several justices expressed reservations about their involvement in the case, citing concerns about the lack of a clear legal issue and the technical complexities involved.In this lawsuit, the shareholders accused Nvidia and its CEO Jensen Huang of violating the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. They alleged that in 2017 and 2018, Nvidia downplayed how much of its revenue growth was driven by cryptocurrency-related purchases.As cryptocurrency prices surged, Nvidia's chips became popular for crypto mining in 2017. However, when crypto profitability declined in 2018, Nvidia's revenue fell short of projections, causing its stock price to drop.The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages to compensate investors for their losses. While Nvidia paid $5.5 million in 2022 to settle charges related to its disclosures about crypto mining's impact on its gaming business, it did not admit or deny wrongdoing.A federal judge initially dismissed the shareholder lawsuit, but the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, stating the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that Huang made ""false or misleading statements and did so knowingly or recklessly.""The shareholders' lawyer, Deepak Gupta, called the Supreme Court's dismissal “a win for corporate accountability.”Gupta added.What Nvidia said about the US Supreme Court’s decisionThe company is ""fully prepared to continue our defence,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said.""Consistent and predictable standards in securities litigation are essential to protecting shareholders and ensuring a strong economy, and we remain committed to supporting them,"" the spokesperson noted.Nvidia argued that the shareholders' lawsuit lacked sufficient evidence to prove false statements or intentional deception. Meanwhile, the shareholders countered that their allegations, supported by various sources including former employees and market analysis, were strong enough to proceed to the discovery phase.",The US Supreme Court has dismissed Nvidia's appeal in a securities fraud lawsuit.

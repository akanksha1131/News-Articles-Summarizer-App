How the H-1B visa fraud happened

Timeline of the sentencing

What is H-1B visa programme

Kishore Dattapuram pleaded guilty in federal court this week to H-1B visa fraud and conspiracy to commit visa fraud. According to a press release US Attorney's Office, Northern District of California, Dattapuram, 55, of Santa Clara, and two other defendants, Kumar Aswapathi , 55, of Austin, Tex., and Santosh Giri , 48, of San Jose, were each charged in an indictment filed February 28, 2019, with one count of conspiracy to commit H-1B visa fraud and 10 counts of substantive visa fraud. Aswapathi pleaded guilty to all counts on October 19, 2020. Giri pleaded guilty to all counts on October 28, 2024.Dattapuram and Aswapathi owned Nanosemantics Inc , a staffing company headquartered in San Jose that provided skilled employees to technology companies in the Bay Area. Under its agreements with the companies and the employees it placed, Nanosemantics received a commission for workers placed at client companies. Giri worked closely with Nanosemantics and was also the owner of a separate business, LexGiri, a legal process outsourcing firm that served as a “remote-virtual corporate immigration specialist” for companies.In connection with its staffing work, Nanosemantics regularly submitted H-1B petitions for foreign workers.In pleading guilty, Dattapuram admitted to working with Aswapathi and Giri to submit fraudulent H-1B applications that falsely represented that foreign workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated end-client companies when in fact the jobs did not exist. On multiple occasions, Dattapuram paid companies to be listed as end-clients for the foreign workers, even though he knew the workers would never work for those employers. As defendants admitted, the goal of the scheme was to allow Nanosemantics to obtain visas for job candidates before securing jobs for them, thereby allowing Nanosemantics to place those workers with employers as soon as those jobs were available, rather than waiting for the visa application process to conclude, and giving Nanosemantics an unfair advantage over its competitors.Dattapuram’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 24, 2025. Giri’s sentencing hearing is also scheduled for the same day. Aswapathi has a status regarding sentencing on November 25, 2024. Each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each visa fraud count, and a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 on the conspiracy count.The H-1B visa programme allows foreign workers to obtain temporary authorization to live and work for companies in the United States. In order to secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit a Form I-129 petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). A petition and associated documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including the wages associated with the position.","Kishore Dattapuram pleaded guilty in federal court this week to H-1B visa fraud and conspiracy to commit visa fraud.

Government to Amazon and Elon Musk's Starlink: Your satellite application can be processed only after ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-amazon-and-elon-musks-starlink-your-satellite-application-can-be-processed-only-after-/articleshow/115124999.cms,"Strict security guidelines and declaration

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

PM Sharif congratulated Trump on Elon Musk-owned social media platform X, formerly Twitter.""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming Administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-U.S. partnership. @realDonaldTrump,"" posted PM Sharif.The Pakistan PM was trolled by some users for wishing Trump on Twitter. As his post was flagged with a community note for an apparent legal breach. The reason for the same is that Sharif allegedly used VPN to access the platform, a practice that is reportedly banned under Pakistan's internet regulations.Shortly after the Pakistan PM posted his congratulatory message for US President elect Donald Trump, Twitter added a Community Note to the post, stating that Sharif was accessing Twitter through a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which, according to Pakistani law, is unlawful.The note read: ""Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has banned X (formerly Twitter) in Pakistan. He is using a VPN to access X, which is unlawful according to Pakistani law.""Though Twitter community note suggests that Sharif was violating local regulations, it is not clear if the Pakistan Prime Minister posted the message from within Pakistan or outside the country.Ban on Twitter in PakistanIn April this year, Pakistan’s interior ministry had imposed a ban on X, citing concerns over national security. Though some reports claim that the platform has remained inaccessible to users within the country since February -- when allegations of a rigged elections first started appearing on social media channels.In a court submission seen by news agency Reuters in September this year, the Interior Ministry alleged that Twitter/X had failed to address issues raised by the government, particularly around the misuse of the platform. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has reportedly notified the Sindh High Court (SHC) that services of Twitter have not been reinstated in the country. A report by the news agency ANI cited the Pakistani publication ARY News to note that PTA Director Law Ali Akbar has informed the SHC that a miscommunication led to its counsel's recent statement about the notification's withdrawal. PTA has reportedly asked the SHC to either revoke or amend its previous order.""The failure of Twitter/X to adhere to the lawful directives of the government of Pakistan and address concerns regarding the misuse of its platform necessitated the imposition of a ban,"" Pakistan's Interior Minister was quoted as saying by Reuters.The Pakistani government had claimed in the court that the platform was being used by ""hostile elements"" to destabilise the country.Reports also suggest that Twitter is in dialogue with the Pakistani government, working to understand its concerns.","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated US President-elect Donald Trump on Twitter.

Mar-a-Lago’s role in the Trump presidency

Following Donald Trump ’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election, security at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, has been significantly reinforced. The former president’s iconic property, which has drawn considerable attention over the years, is now equipped with advanced military-grade security technology. A recent video circulating on social media has revealed some of these high-tech measures, including the use of a robotic dog patrolling the estate’s grounds. As Trump begins his transition process, the fortified security at Mar-a-Lago reflects heightened safety concerns and precautions surrounding his new role.The footage, which has quickly gone viral on platforms like Twitter, offers a rare glimpse into the elevated security protocols implemented at Mar-a-Lago. One of the most noticeable additions is the use of a robotic dog, which is seen patrolling the property’s perimeters. These robotic security dogs are part of a cutting-edge technology used by various government and military organisations worldwide for their agility, surveillance capabilities, and ability to operate autonomously. Equipped with cameras and sensors, these robotic units can detect intruders, analyse threats, and provide real-time data to security personnel.This particular model, believed to be a product of advanced robotics, reflects Trump’s security team’s commitment to deploying the latest technology in protecting the president-elect. Mar-a-Lago’s extensive grounds and high-profile visitors make it essential to have both human and robotic surveillance in place, ensuring comprehensive coverage and enhanced protection.The upgraded security measures at Mar-a-Lago reflect the evolving challenges associated with safeguarding high-profile figures in today’s technological landscape. Security teams at Mar-a-Lago are now combining traditional protection with state-of-the-art technology, offering multi-layered security that leverages AI and autonomous systems. Robotic dogs, specifically, are ideal for extensive properties as they can patrol larger areas with minimal human intervention.These robotic dogs are programmed to navigate complex terrain, alert human guards to potential threats, and deter unauthorised individuals. Additionally, they possess cameras that transmit real-time video, allowing security teams to monitor multiple areas simultaneously. The technology behind these robotic dogs is gaining popularity not only for its efficiency but also for reducing risks to human security personnel.The deployment of advanced robotic security at Mar-a-Lago has stirred considerable interest on social media. Users on Twitter and other platforms have shared opinions ranging from fascination to curiosity about how technology is transforming traditional security protocols. The viral video has garnered thousands of views, with people commenting on the futuristic security approach and discussing its implications.Supporters have praised the move, noting that heightened security is a necessary precaution for the president-elect. Others, however, expressed concern about the implications of increased reliance on technology in personal security, speculating on how such measures might influence privacy and the future of security.Mar-a-Lago has long served as Trump’s winter residence and a hub for his political and business activities. With his upcoming presidency, the estate is likely to continue playing a significant role, hosting meetings with international leaders, supporters, and key figures in his administration. The reinforced security, therefore, is not just a precaution but a foundational aspect of safeguarding a property of such strategic importance.Trump’s decision to remain at Mar-a-Lago post-election could also mean that the estate will see a substantial increase in security personnel, both on-site and within the surrounding areas. The local community and authorities are expected to collaborate closely to ensure that Mar-a-Lago remains a secure location, equipped to handle the demands of a presidential residence.","Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, is now equipped with advanced military-grade security technology.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao claims that his “felon status” hasn’t discouraged people from doing business with him. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Zhao recounted how he initially went unrecognized in prison, but his reputation for wealth and expertise in crypto soon attracted attention.Zhao pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering charges in 2023. He was sentenced to prison in April, becoming the richest-ever US inmate. He served a four-month sentence at a minimum-security prison in California and was released earlier this year in September.Recalling inquiries from fellow inmates and prison guards, he said “Many of them asked me which coins they should buy”. He said that he would often tell others, ""I don’t have access to any information. I don’t even know what the market looks like.""When Zhao was still CEO, Binance invested $500 million in Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, now known as X. Since then, the value of the social-media platform has declined. Commenting on the direction Musk has taken X, he said “I think after Elon took over, things have moved a lot faster at Twitter. There’s new features, change happens at a much faster pace. I’m not too concerned about the value of the investment going up or down. We’re very long-term investors.”","Zhao pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering charges in 2023. He was sentenced to prison in April, becoming the richest-ever US inmate.

For the first time in Indian television history, two influential power couples from the worlds of technology, business, and philanthropy will grace The Great Indian Kapil Show . This weekend’s much-anticipated episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists, alongside Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal and his wife, Mexican model Grecia Munoz (Gia Goyal). A recent teaser released by Netflix has already generated significant excitement, providing a glimpse into the candid, humorous, and heartwarming moments that await viewers. Hosted by comedian Kapil Sharma, the episode is set to showcase personal stories, cultural exchanges, and anecdotes from the lives of these remarkable personalities.In the teaser, NR Narayana Murthy, 78, reflects on his initial meeting with a young Sudha Murty, recalling the profound impact she had on him. Describing her as “a breath of fresh air,” Murthy shared his admiration for her intelligence, kindness, and dedication to social causes. Now married for 47 years, the couple has become one of India’s most respected duos, with Sudha Murty achieving acclaim as an author, Rajya Sabha member, and philanthropist.When Kapil Sharma humorously questioned whether their habits have grown similar over the years, Sudha Murty responded with her characteristic humor and honesty. “I became a workaholic like him and a stickler for time,” she shared, adding, “I cook so badly, but he never complains. Look at Murthy saab's weight — that's thanks to my cooking!” The playful exchange between the Murthys highlighted their mutual respect and understanding, as well as Sudha’s humility and humor about her culinary skills.The episode also introduces Deepinder Goyal, co-founder of Zomato, and his wife, Grecia Munoz, who he married earlier this year. Known for her vibrant personality and background in modeling, Grecia has embraced her role alongside Deepinder, even immersing herself in Zomato’s operations. During the show, Goyal shared an amusing story about how he and Grecia surprised Zomato customers by delivering orders themselves in Gurgaon. The reaction of customers, who were surprised and delighted by Grecia’s appearance at their doorsteps, quickly became the highlight of the conversation.“When Gia delivers the order, the customers can’t help but keep staring,” Goyal laughed, prompting a burst of laughter from the audience and Kapil Sharma. The couple’s chemistry and lighthearted attitude have made them popular among Zomato’s users and the public, with fans appreciating Grecia’s willingness to engage directly with Goyal’s business and her adaptation to Indian culture.This is not the first time Sudha Murty has appeared on Kapil Sharma’s platform. Last year, she joined The Kapil Sharma Show alongside filmmaker Guneet Monga and actress Raveena Tandon, where she shared personal anecdotes about her life and experiences. The audience was captivated by her wisdom and humility, as she recounted stories from her travels, including a memorable instance at an airport where she was labeled “cattle class” for wearing traditional attire. Sudha used humor to narrate her response, underscoring her pride in her cultural roots and her unshakeable confidence.In addition to her philanthropic and literary contributions, Sudha Murty’s previous appearance also revealed her admiration for Bollywood legends such as Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar, bridging the worlds of Indian cinema and literature.The teaser release has already stirred excitement among fans, who are eager to see the contrasting yet complementary dynamics of these two couples. While the Murthys are admired for their contributions to India’s technology and education sectors, Deepinder and Grecia have gained popularity as a young, modern couple who represent the global, interconnected nature of today’s India.Social media platforms have been abuzz with comments from viewers looking forward to the episode, with many expressing admiration for Sudha Murty’s humility and wit, and curiosity about Grecia’s adaptation to life in India. Fans also anticipate candid moments and stories from the lives of the Murthys and the Goyals, hoping for inspiring takeaways from both the established and next-generation leaders in India’s entrepreneurial landscape.","This weekend’s episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists.

Attorney General initiates health and privacy investigation

Vice President Teodoro Nguema calls for accountability

Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga , is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos allegedly involving him in intimate encounters with multiple individuals. Originally investigated for alleged fraud, Engonga now faces public backlash and intensified scrutiny over his professional conduct and personal life. This controversy has sparked widespread reaction on social media and raised questions regarding ethics, public responsibility, and potential health risks associated with his actions. As the scandal unfolds, government authorities have initiated an official investigation, underscoring the increasing call for accountability among public officials in Equatorial Guinea.The scandal began when investigators, initially looking into Engonga for suspected fraud, reportedly discovered over 400 videos on his computer depicting private interactions with various individuals. These encounters allegedly involved multiple partners, including his brother’s wife, a cousin, and a relative of the President. According to sources, the videos were filmed in locations such as Engonga’s office, hotels, and even restrooms, with all recorded interactions believed to be consensual.Once leaked, the videos rapidly circulated across social media, sparking outrage and debate among citizens. Public response to the videos has varied, with many questioning the ethical standards of a high-ranking public official engaging in such activities, while others raised concerns about the privacy breach that led to the leak. Posts across social platforms criticised the conduct of a figure responsible for financial investigations, with some users highlighting the discrepancy between his public role and personal actions.In response to the viral scandal, Equatorial Guinea’s Attorney General’s Office, led by Anatolio Nzang Nguema, launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video leak. According to a spokesperson, authorities are assessing whether Engonga’s actions may have posed health risks, which could result in additional charges if confirmed.“If proven, he could face charges for endangering public health,” the spokesperson commented, emphasising that the investigation will extend beyond the videos themselves to assess any potential impact on public health.This probe into health risks marks a significant expansion of the investigation, as the Attorney General’s office examines both the privacy concerns involved in the leak and the broader implications of Engonga’s behaviour on public welfare. The investigation is expected to review the conduct of government officials and enforce measures to maintain accountability.In a public statement, Vice President Teodoro Nguema took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the scandal, emphasising the need for accountability among public officials. Nguema noted that government offices must be strictly reserved for official duties, signalling disapproval of the misuse of government resources and office spaces for personal purposes.Nguema announced that the government would be implementing new, stricter policies to ensure that misconduct within the administration is met with serious disciplinary action. He further stated that officials found guilty of misusing their authority or resources could face termination or other consequences as deemed appropriate. This stance reflects a broader governmental shift towards enforcing ethical standards and reinforces the message that public officials will be held responsible for their actions, especially when it comes to misuse of office privileges.Engonga, a married man and father of six, holds a prominent position at ANIF, leading financial investigations and initiatives against corruption. However, his involvement in the leaked videos has placed his career and reputation under intense public scrutiny. The scandal has opened a wider debate on the expectations placed on public officials, with many citizens questioning whether private conduct should impact public responsibility and ethical standards.As public opinion continues to weigh in, some have called for Engonga’s resignation, while others argue that privacy should protect personal matters unless they directly impact professional duties. The case has ignited a conversation on the balance between privacy and public accountability, particularly when it comes to those in leadership roles within the government.","Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency, Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos.

Elon Musk's net worth surged by $26.5 billion after the victory of Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump in the US elections. Musk, the world's richest person, has been one of Trump's largest supporters. Reports suggest that Elon Musk donated around $130 million to Donald Trump's campaign as well as supporting him on his social media platform X (earlier Twitter).While Tesla CEO Elon Musk may not have planned it. But his support for Donald Trump has done wonders to his net worth. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Musk's net worth grew to $290 billion post the US election results. Reason: the surge in his companies' stock price.Musk's Tesla saw a 15% increase in its share price which adds to Tesla's already impressive performance, with shares up 32% over the past year. Musk, a supporter of the president-elect, is expected to play a role in policy decisions, further boosting investor confidence in Tesla.Alongside Musk, the fortunes of the other nine individuals in the world’s top 10 richest list also saw a record daily surge as Donald Trump secured a second term as president.As per Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, the net worth of the world's wealthiest individuals surged by a record $63.5 billion, fueled by a post-election rally in US stocks. Apart from Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Oracle's Larry Ellison were also among the top gainers.This surge in wealth also extends to other tech billionaires, including crypto leaders Brian Armstrong of Coinbase and Changpeng Zhao of Binance. Armstrong’s net worth increased by 30% to $11 billion while Zhao’s Binance added $12.1 billion post the US election which boosted his net worth to $52.7 billion.The surge in wealth is also attributed to market optimism following the US election, with investors anticipating lower taxes and deregulation under the new administration.The S&P 500 also experienced its best post-election performance in history, jumping 2.5%, while the US dollar also strengthened.","Elon Musk's net worth surged by $26.5 billion after the victory of Donald Trump in the US elections.

French and Dutch authorities raided Netflix offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday, November 5, as part of an investigation into alleged tax fraud and concealed employment, according to French judicial sources.The searches, conducted by France's National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF) and corruption investigators, stem from a preliminary investigation opened in November 2022 into suspected "" laundering of aggravated tax fraud "" and ""concealed work in an organised gang.""The raids follow scrutiny of Netflix's tax declarations between 2019 and 2020, when the company's reported French revenue appeared inconsistent with its subscriber base of approximately 7 million users. According to French media outlet La Lettre, Netflix Services France paid just €981,000 ($1.06 million) in corporate taxes for 2019-2020.Netflix's declared turnover in France increased dramatically after 2020, rising from €47.1 million ($51.3 million) to €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2022, suggesting the company may have previously used tax optimization strategies through its Dutch (Netherlands) subsidiary.The simultaneous searches at Netflix's European headquarters in Amsterdam were conducted through cooperation between French and Dutch authorities that has been ongoing for several months, officials said.This is not Netflix's first tax-related issue in Europe. In 2022, the streaming giant paid €55.8 million ($59.1 million) to settle a tax dispute with Italian authorities.Netflix, which opened its Paris office in 2020 and employs around 40 staff there, has not responded to requests for comment on the raids.

AI humanoid robot's Alan Turing painting sells for $1 million at auction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-humanoid-robots-alan-turing-painting-sells-for-1-million-at-auction/articleshow/115114571.cms,"How Ai-Da created this artwork



An artwork created by an AI-powered humanoid robot has sold for a record $1.08 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The painting, a 2.2-metre (7.5-foot) portrait of British computer scientist Alan Turing, surpassed its pre-auction estimate of $120,000-$180,000. It attracted 27 bids before being sold to an anonymous buyer.The artwork named “AI God: Portrait of Alan Turing,” was created by Ai-Da, a humanoid robot artist developed by Aidan Meller. Ai-Da uses AI algorithms and a robotic arm to create paintings, sculptures, and other forms of art.The painting's subject, Alan Turing, was a computer scientist who helped decrypt German codes during World War II but tragically died by suicide after facing persecution for his homosexuality. Meller hopes Ai-Da's work will spark reflection on the future of AI and its impact on humanity.Ai-Da, the humanoid robot artist, was brought to life in 2019 through a collaboration between Meller and a robotics company in Cornwall, UK.In a statement to CNN, Meller said that before starting a project, Ai-Da engages in discussions with its creators, expressing its preferences and ideas for the piece it wants to create.“In this instance, we had a discussion with her about ‘A.I. for good’ which led to Ai-Da bringing up Alan Turing as a key person in the history of A.I. that she wanted to paint,” Meller noted.Ai-Da's creation of the Alan Turing portrait involved a multi-stage process combining AI, robotics, and artistic decision-making. After discussing the painting's style and concept with its creators, Ai-Da used its camera eyes to analyze a photo of Turing and generate preliminary sketches.The robot then painted 15 individual portraits of Turing's face, each unique due to the AI algorithm's interpretation of the photo. Each painting took 6-8 hours to complete. Ai-Da then selected three of these portraits, along with a painting of Turing's Bombe Machine, to be combined into the final artwork.Due to the limited size of Ai-Da's canvas, the final image was printed onto a larger canvas using a 3D textured printer, preserving the original artwork's details. This process reflects the evolving capabilities of Ai-Da, whose agency and technology are constantly being refined.","Ai-Da, a humanoid robot artist, created a portrait of British computer scientist Alan Turing.

Google searches for ""How to move to Canada” increased in the US as the country elected Donald Trump as the next president. According to a report by Newsweek, Google Trends data showed a 400% surge in these searches on election night, with the highest interest coming from states that strongly supported Vice President Kamala Harris, including Vermont, Oregon, and Washington.

A couple in Himachal Pradesh got married virtually, on a video call.

With the bride's ailing grandfather's desire for the wedding to proceed, the families agreed to a virtual ""nikah"" ceremony.The groom's family travelled from Bilaspur to Mandi, where the bride resided. The couple connected via video call, and a qazi performed the rituals, with the couple exchanging vows saying ""qubool hai"" thrice remotely.Akram Mohammad, the uncle of the bride, said the wedding was made possible only due to the advanced technology.A similar incident occurred last year when a couple in Himachal Pradesh, Ashish Singha from Kotgarh in Shimla and Shivani Thakur from Bhuntar, had a virtual wedding due to landslides preventing the groom's family from reaching the venue.During the Covid-19 pandemic, a couple in Kerala, Vignesh KM and Anjali Ranjith also opted for this unique solution to tie the knot: a virtual wedding ceremony conducted over Zoom.They even designed an e-invitation with a Zoom ID and password for guests to attend remotely.

The Company expects that the Plan will be substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.”

“There’s simply no good time to make a decision like this that affects people’s lives and it’s my responsibility to be transparent about how and why this decision was made. I am immensely grateful to those who will be leaving for their significant contributions to Freshworks. While this is likely an unexpected way to end your time here, I hope you leave feeling proud of the impact you’ve had.”

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu slammed IT company Freshworks for its recent job cuts. Taking to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), Vembu called the move “naked greed”, questioning the “vision” of its leadership.Earlier this week, Freshworks announced to lay off 12%-13% of its workforce. The job cuts, which is a part of the company’s efforts to streamline operations, will impact 660 employees across the US, India and other locations.In the post, Zoho CEO criticised the company for laying off employees, despite maintaining high cash reserves. He said “A company that has $1 billion cash, which is about 1.5 times its annual revenue, and is actually still growing at a decent 20% rate and making a cash profit, laying off 12-13% of its workforce should not expect any loyalty from its employees ever.”He stated that what adds ‘insult to injury’ to the impacted employees is that the layoffs are announced at a time “when it can afford $400 million in a stock buy back.” For those unaware, Freshworks recently announced that its board of directors approved a $400 million share buyback programme of its outstanding Class A common stock.He saidHe stated that this behaviour, “has become all too common in the US corporate world” and is being imported in India. “It has only resulted in large scale employee cynicism in the US and we are importing that too,” he added.Announcing the job cuts, Fresh works CEO Dennis Woodside said:","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu slammed IT company Freshworks for its recent job cuts.

TCS cuts variable pay of senior staff for July-September quarter: What the company has to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tcs-cuts-variable-pay-of-senior-staff-for-july-september-quarter-what-the-company-has-to-say/articleshow/115101764.cms,"How TCS pays variables to staff

What the company has to say

Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) has reduced variable pay for some employees in the July-September quarter, a report has said, adding that the cuts have hit even those who have complied with the company's work-from-office policy.Citing sources close to the matter, Moneycontrol reported that while some employees received only 20-40% of their quarterly variable pay, others received no variable pay at all. This marks a significant drop from the 70% payout in the previous quarter.In April 2024, TCS revised its attendance policy, mandating a minimum of 85% office attendance for employees to receive their full variable pay. Employees with lower attendance rates receive a reduced percentage of their variable pay, with those below 60% ineligible for the bonus.TCS links variable pay to office attendance as well as it also depends on the performance of individual business units. The report also said that the recent cuts reflect the challenging demand environment and economic uncertainties that have led to slower growth for major IT services companies in the second quarter.In Q2, India's largest IT services company reported a 5.5% year-on-year revenue growth in constant currency terms.“We expect the headwinds to stabilise in Q3 and return to growth in Q4,” the company told analysts in its post-earnings call last month.A TCS spokesperson clarified that junior-level employees received 100% of their quarterly variable allowance (QVA). However, for other grades, the QVA is based on their unit's business performance, consistent with the company's usual practice.“For Q2FY25 we have paid out 100% QVA to junior grades across the company. For all other grades, the QVA depends on their unit’s business performance. This is in line with our standard practice across quarters,” a TCS spokesperson was quoted as saying.","Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) has reduced variable pay for some employees in the July-September quarter.

Sources briefed on the conversation told Axios that while specific policy details weren't discussed, the Ukrainian president found the timing of the call encouraging and was not left feeling anxious about Trump's victory.Musk's presence on the high-level diplomatic call follows reports of his substantial campaign contribution of $119 million to Trump and speculation about a potential cabinet position in the upcoming administration.The SpaceX CEO was also present during Trump's call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, where it was revealed the two were having dinner together.Despite Trump's campaign promises to quickly broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, sources say the president-elect did not delve into specific plans during Wednesday's call. Zelenskyy later acknowledged in Budapest that while Trump desires a swift end to the conflict, they hadn't discussed detailed proposals.The relationship between Musk and Ukraine has been complex, with the tech entrepreneur previously drawing criticism for mocking Ukraine's requests for aid and proposing his own peace plan in 2022. However, his Starlink technology remains vital to Ukraine's war effort.The billionaire's involvement in high-level diplomacy comes as The Wall Street Journal revealed his regular communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022.

How Kingfisher and Phoenix work

Onix has launched two AI-powered products aimed at solving the data-related challenges that large tech companies are currently facing. These include data scarcity, privacy concerns and the complexities of AI implementation.The cloud-native IT company that provides services in data, cloud and AI solutions modernisation has unveiled Kingfisher , a synthetic data generator, and Phoenix, an AI-powered business intelligence framework. The latest solutions join its Birds product suite aimed at streamlining AI-powered business intelligence.During a conversation with journalists on the sidelines of Onix's inaugural Annual Day, company CEO Sanjay Singh along with CTO Niraj Kumar talked about tech companies' reliance on AI for growth has skyrocketed the demand for high-quality, compliant data.They noted that as organisations struggle to navigate the complexities of deploying and managing AI systems effectively, Onix's Kingfisher and Phoenix tackle these challenges, providing businesses with powerful tools to unlock the full potential of AI.“Kingfisher and Phoenix aren’t just products—they’re transformative solutions that enable enterprises to innovate at scale with absolute confidence in data privacy and efficiency,” said Singh, adding that the solutions provide privacy.As per Kumar, Kingfisher addresses the need for secure and privacy-compliant data by generating synthetic data that mirrors the characteristics of real data without compromising sensitive information. He explained that this AI-powered solution analyses production code and identifies edge cases to create comprehensive datasets that are statistically identical to real data, enabling risk-free development, testing, and AI/ML model training.After the synthetic data is created, Phoenix simplifies the process of extracting meaningful insights from data, and by leveraging AI-powered automation, Phoenix enables real-time, conversational data querying and delivers intuitive, explainable insights.When asked how Onix’s approach is different from other tech giants, Singh explained that the company differentiates itself in the industry by leveraging AI and data modernisation. He highlighted their unique approach to data migration and integration, focusing on building a contextual understanding of the data landscape to enable AI-driven solutions.As per Kumar, while Kingfisher solves scarcity issues while protecting sensitive information ethically, Phoenix simplifies AI deployment, enabling enterprises to harness powerful models without the usual complexities.When asked about bias and privacy about the generated synthetic data, Kumar told The Times of India Tech that “the notion of synthetic data generation is to take care of the ethical area.”“Otherwise what will happen? It will expose all real data to the users even though you have used it for training purposes. Hence, all the access privileges are defined, so we protect the data and implement all policies, privileges and roles, and the user groups accordingly,” he explained.For example, even if an AI chatbot is trained on data related to credit card numbers, when asked through LLM or natural language, it will only give users the answer if you have privileged access to it. Otherwise, it will say, “I'm not able to give because you don't have access to it”.","Onix has launched two AI-powered products aimed at solving the data-related challenges that large tech companies are currently facing.

Where do Apple, Microsoft stand

Musk’s net worth surged by $26.5 billion

Nvidia's stock soared to new heights, taking the chipmaker to a historic milestone. The US-based chipmaker’s company's market capitalisation surpassed $3.6 trillion, making it the first ever to achieve such a valuation. Reportedly, this surge comes soon after the market was fueled by the recent re-election of Donald Trump as the US President.As per news agency Reuters, Nvidia's shares rose 2.2% on Thursday (November 7), driven by expectations of potential policy changes that could favour the tech industry. The company's stock market value closed at $3.65 trillion, exceeding Apple 's previous record of $3.57 trillion set on October 21.The latest surge placed Nvidia ahead of other tech giants in terms of market capitalisation with Apple's market value standing at $3.44 trillion, while Microsoft trails at nearly $3.16 trillion at the time of writing. This is not the first time that Nvidia has overtaken both Apple and Microsoft, it recently surged ahead of the tech giants to become the most valued company.In June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalisations have been neck-and-neck for several months.This achievement essentially solidifies Nvidia's position as a dominant force in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence (AI) – beating tech giants like Google and other heavyweights working on the same technology.It is not just Nvidia that had its worth jump exponentially – Elon Musk's net worth also surged by $26.5 billion after Trump’s victory in the US elections. Musk, the world's richest person and who has been one of Trump's biggest supporters, reportedly donated around $130 million to Trump's campaign as well as supporting him on his social media platform X (earlier Twitter).

Food delivery platforms Zomato and SoftBank-backed Swiggy have allegedly violated competition laws. India's antitrust watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), has reportedly discovered that Zomato and Swiggy engaged in practices that violate competition laws. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, documents have revealed that business practices of these popular food delivery platforms favour select restaurants listed on their platforms. The report cited some documents prepared by the CCI (which are not available to the public) to claim that Zomato offered lower commissions to restaurants that signed exclusivity agreements, while Swiggy guaranteed business growth to certain restaurants that listed exclusively on its platform. These practices are seen as anti-competitive and potentially harmful to smaller restaurants and consumers. The CCI's findings could lead to penalties and corrective measures for both Zomato and Swiggy.The investigation launched in 2022 reportedly started after a complaint by the National Restaurant Association of India.

Taiwan's semiconductor sector on edge

CHIPS Act future remains uncertain

China's semiconductor industry is gearing up for Donald Trump 's return to the White House by accelerating equipment purchases and exploring new talent recruitment strategies, according to industry experts and documents reviewed by Reuters.The aggressive preparation comes as Trump, who previously targeted Chinese tech giants Huawei and SMIC with trade restrictions, is expected to take an even tougher stance on China's chip ambitions in his second term. Industry experts told Reuters that Chinese firms are significantly better prepared this time, having learned crucial lessons from Trump's first presidency.Chinese manufacturers have particularly focused on acquiring lithography machines, with imports surging 35.44% to $7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, Chinese customs data reveals. The majority of these machines came from the Netherlands, valued at $7 billion, before new restrictions took effect.Companies have maximised equipment orders to hedge against future restrictions. Chinese chip maker Jinan Lujing Semiconductor Co's emphasis on self-reliance echoes a broader industry sentiment, noting that Trump's first term had already highlighted ""the necessity of localization.""""Chinese tech companies have progressively expanded their production capacities to mitigate future risks,"" Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners, told Reuters.The Beijing Semiconductor Industry Association is advising companies to seize potential opportunities if global coordination on chip sanctions weakens under Trump. ""There could be benefits to China's semiconductor industry in terms of professional talents, multinational companies and foreign cooperation,"" said Zhu Jing, the association's deputy secretary-general, in a WeChat post.The situation has created ripples in Taiwan, where semiconductor giant TSMC faces uncertainty about its global operations. Despite growing concerns, Taiwan's leader William Lai Ching-te projected confidence on Wednesday, stating that ""the long-standing Taiwan-US partnership, based on shared values and interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone of regional stability.""However, Trump's recent comments have stirred anxiety in Taiwan's chip sector. During an October appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Trump accused Taiwan of ""stealing"" the US chip industry, questioning the island's role in global semiconductor supply chains. His former national security adviser John Bolton notably warned that under a second Trump term, ""Taiwan is potentially toast.""Despite these tensions, TSMC has affirmed its commitment to its US investments. The world's largest contract chipmaker announced it would continue with its $65 billion investment plan for new factories in Arizona, regardless of Trump's election victory.TSMC has notified Chinese chip design companies that it will suspend production of their most advanced AI chips starting Monday, according to the Financial Times. The world's largest contract chipmaker will no longer manufacture AI chips at advanced process nodes of 7 nanometres or smaller for Chinese customers, with future supplies subject to Washington's approval.According to CNBC, despite Trump's campaign rhetoric against the CHIPS Act, policy experts believe the $53 billion semiconductor initiative will likely remain largely intact, though with possible modifications to fund allocation.While policy experts anticipate the CHIPS Act will survive Trump's return, the semiconductor industry's landscape remains in flux. As both Chinese and Taiwanese chip sectors brace for potential policy shifts, the $53 billion US semiconductor initiative stands as a critical factor in shaping the industry's global future, despite lingering uncertainty about Trump's trade policies.","China's semiconductor industry is gearing up for Donald Trump's return to the White House by accelerating equipment purchases.

TikTok ban: From US to Canada here’s a list of countries that have banned TikTok,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-ban-from-us-to-canada-heres-a-list-of-countries-that-have-banned-tiktok/articleshow/115082870.cms,"List of countries where TikTok is banned

Afghanistan: The Taliban banned TikTok in April 2022, citing its “misleading” influence on the country’s youth. The move aligns with Afghanistan’s restrictive cultural policies, where the government exercises strict control over media and content to enforce its societal norms.

Armenia and Azerbaijan: During periods of military tension, including recent border clashes, these two countries have temporarily blocked TikTok. Azerbaijan lifted its most recent ban in October 2023. The temporary bans reflect concerns that the app could be misused for spreading information or propaganda during conflicts.

Australia: TikTok has been banned on government devices in Australia since April 2023. However, the general public can still access and use the app, suggesting that Australia’s primary concern lies in protecting sensitive government data.

Austria, Denmark, and the European Union: Several European nations, including Austria and Denmark, as well as institutions within the European Union, have restricted TikTok on government-issued devices. European security agencies are concerned about the possibility of foreign access to user data, especially with China’s growing influence in technology.

India: India enacted a comprehensive ban on TikTok in 2020 after a deadly border clash with China. The government cited national security as the reason, marking one of the first full-scale bans on the app worldwide. Indian content creators, previously very active on TikTok, moved to other platforms such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels to maintain their audiences.

Indonesia: In October 2023, Indonesia banned TikTok’s “Shop” feature, citing violations of local e-commerce regulations. The country’s selective restriction is an example of how governments may choose to regulate specific functionalities of an app to align with local laws, rather than banning it outright.

Iran and Pakistan: Both countries have intermittently blocked TikTok, often citing social, moral, or ethical concerns. Iran has long restricted internet access to global platforms, including TikTok, as part of broader controls on content that conflicts with its government’s values.

United States: Congress and the U.S. military have barred TikTok from all government devices, and around half of U.S. states have adopted similar restrictions for state-owned devices. The primary concern in the U.S. is foreign access to personal data, as there are fears that the Chinese government could exploit user information for intelligence purposes.

Russia: Although TikTok is still accessible in Russia, users are mainly shown content generated within the country. This restriction reflects Russia’s increasing control over online information and its efforts to limit foreign influence on Russian users.

Other countries: Numerous other nations have enacted restrictions based on their unique concerns. For example, Jordan banned TikTok following civil unrest in December 2022, citing concerns over its use to spread misinformation. In Nepal, a ban was issued in November 2023, and Somalia has also blocked TikTok over concerns about its role in spreading propaganda and extremist content.

Canada has recently issued a directive to close TikTok’s offices in Toronto and Vancouver, citing increasing concerns over data privacy and potential foreign influence, specifically in relation to the app’s Chinese ownership. This action reflects a serious response to perceived risks associated with TikTok’s data collection and sharing practices, which have been scrutinised in Canada and internationally. The announcement, made by Canadian officials on Wednesday, underscores the government’s belief that TikTok poses a security threat due to the potential misuse of user data and the influence that foreign entities could exert through the platform.As more countries seek to protect their citizens’ information and limit potential foreign influence, TikTok’s operations and global reach may be further impacted, influencing both the app’s future growth and the broader conversation around data security and privacy on social media platforms.Canada’s move aligns with a growing international trend where countries are imposing bans, restrictions, or partial limitations on TikTok, typically because of privacy concerns, national security, or ethical reasons. Here’s a detailed overview of the actions taken by various countries:Across these regions, governments share common concerns around data privacy, national security, and the platform’s influence on social behaviour. Many governments worry that TikTok’s data-gathering techniques allow it to collect extensive personal information, which could be accessed by foreign entities. Additionally, with TikTok’s growing popularity, there’s a fear of the app being used to shape public opinion, especially in politically sensitive regions. For instance, during conflicts, TikTok could theoretically be leveraged to disseminate propaganda or influence public perception.","The Taliban banned TikTok in Afghanistan in April 2022, citing its ‘misleading’ influence on the country’s youth. India enacted a comprehensive ban on TikTok after a deadly border clash with China in 2020. The U.S. military and Congress have barred TikTok from all government devices. Many European nations, including Austria and Denmark, have restricted TikTok on government-issued devices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115083858,imgsize-11032,width-400,resizemode-4/115083858.jpg"
"Bengaluru traffic police to launch super-app for real-time traffic updates, reporting accidents",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bengaluru-traffic-police-to-launch-super-app-for-real-time-traffic-updates-reporting-accidents/articleshow/115082228.cms,"Representative Image

What Bengaluru police said about this app



“We want to integrate the Public Eye and other services into a single app. Even the traffic police will start using the app with added features to report road incidents. They (the agency) will make a digital map of the city that we can use to simulate projects such as road closures or changing one-ways without inconveniencing people. If the simulation shows better results, we want to implement those changes.”

“All work orders will be finalised by the end of this month and works will be completed by January,”

Bengaluru commuters may soon have a ""one-stop"" solution for all traffic updates. The Bengaluru Traffic Police is reportedly planning to launch the ASTraM (Actionable Intelligence for Sustainable Traffic Management) super-app within the next two months. This app will provide real-time traffic congestion updates and will even allow users to report accidents.The app aims to eliminate the need for relying on multiple navigation apps or social media for traffic information. According to a report by Deccan Herald, users will be able to report violations and accidents on this app by submitting images without revealing their personal information.However, this new app will be different from the existing ASTraM app, which is exclusively for traffic police to monitor and analyse traffic patterns. The upcoming public version is expected to cover the entire city, expanding from the current simulation model that covers 21 major traffic corridors.In a statement to Deccan Herald, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M N Anucheth said the new ""one-stop"" super-app will offer several useful features for commuters, including real-time traffic congestion alerts within a 5-kilometre radius, the ability to report accidents and a convenient way to view and pay traffic fines.JCP Anucheth said:The traffic police will also hire eligible agencies to create microsimulation models of the city within the next three months. This will enable them to model individual vehicle movement to assess the traffic, down to a street level, to manage it better.The Bengaluru Traffic Police's super-app is part of a broader initiative to improve traffic management in the city. This initiative includes various projects, such as procuring new signboards, solar blinkers, body-worn cameras, and cat's eyes to enhance road safety. Tenders for these projects were released in October, and work is currently underway, JCP Anucheth noted.he added.",Bengaluru Traffic Police is reportedly planning to launch the ASTraM super-app within the next two months.

Hackers demands payment in breads after breaching French giant Schneider Electric,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/hackers-demands-payment-in-breads-after-breaching-french-giant-schneider-electric/articleshow/115082080.cms,"A newly emerged ransomware group has demanded an unusual ransom from French multinational Schneider Electric : $125,000 worth of baguettes (a bread of French origin), marking one of the most bizarre extortion attempts in recent cybercrime history.The demand would require approximately 58,715 French baguettes, though security experts believe the bread-based ransom is likely a publicity stunt. According to BleepingComputer, the group, known as Hellcat, is actually seeking payment in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero.Schneider Electric, an energy management and industrial automation company, confirmed it is investigating unauthorised access to one of its internal project tracking platforms. ""Our Global Incident Response team has been immediately mobilised to respond to the incident,"" the company stated, emphasising that its products and services remain unaffected.The hackers claim to have prevailed 40GB of compressed data, including over 400,000 rows of user information, after breaching the company's Atlassian Jira system using exposed credentials. BleepingComputer reports that the stolen data contains approximately 75,000 unique email addresses and full names of employees and customers.Hellcat, previously known as the International Contract Agency before rebranding, has offered to halve the ransom if Schneider Electric publicly acknowledges the breach. The group's spokesperson, who goes by ""Grep,"" indicated they are currently testing an encryptor for future attacks.Last month, Japanese electronics company Casio confirmed that a ransomware attack in October resulted in the theft of customer data, as well as sensitive employee and company information.","A newly emerged ransomware group has demanded an unusual ransom from French multinational Schneider Electric.

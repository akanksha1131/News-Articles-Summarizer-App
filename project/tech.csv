"'Inspired' by mouse watching clips from 'The Matrix', scientists create largest functional map of a brain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/inspired-by-mouse-watching-clips-from-the-matrix-scientists-create-largest-functional-map-of-a-brain/articleshow/120262614.cms,"Representative Image

Thanks to a mouse watching clips from 'The Matrix', scientists have unveiled the most detailed functional brain map ever, charting connections between 84,000 neurons across 500 million synapses, according to a study published Wednesday in Nature. Using a poppy-seed-sized piece of the mouse’s brain, researchers traced how neurons communicated through intricate, branch-like fibers, creating a vibrant 3D reconstruction of the neural circuitry. The dataset, now publicly available, offers scientists worldwide a tool to explore brain function and invites curious minds to peek into its complexity.“It definitely inspires a sense of awe, just like looking at pictures of the galaxies,” Forrest Collman of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle told The Associated Press. “You get a sense of how complicated you are. We’re looking at one tiny part ... of a mouse’s brain and the beauty and complexity that you can see in these actual neurons and the hundreds of millions of connections between them.”The project, involving over 150 researchers globally, focused on the mouse’s visual cortex. At Baylor College of Medicine, scientists showed a genetically engineered mouse—its neurons glowing when active—video snippets of sci-fi films, sports, animations, and nature. A laser-powered microscope captured how cells lit up as the mouse processed the images, the AP reported.At the Allen Institute, that brain fragment was sliced into over 25,000 ultra-thin layers and imaged with electron microscopes, producing nearly 100 million high-resolution pictures. Princeton University researchers then used AI to trace the neural connections, with Collman explaining to the AP that they “paint each of the individual wires a different color so that we can identify them individually.”The mapped wiring, stretching over three miles if laid end-to-end, revealed how visual information flows through the brain. “You can make a thousand hypotheses about how brain cells might do their job but you can’t test those hypotheses unless you know ... how are those cells wired together,” Allen Institute scientist Clay Reid told the AP.The study’s implications are vast. Researchers likened it to the Human Genome Project, a foundational step toward future treatments. “The technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,” Princeton neuroscientist Sebastian Seung said in a statement to the AP.Harvard neuroscientists Mariela Petkova and Gregor Schuhknecht, unaffiliated with the study, praised it to the AP, saying the work “marks a major leap forwards and offers an invaluable community resource for future discoveries” in understanding cognition and behavior.Funded by the NIH’s BRAIN Initiative and IARPA, the MICrONS consortium aims next to map an entire mouse brain , a step toward unraveling disorders like Alzheimer’s or autism, the AP noted. For now, this neural map—born from a mouse and a movie—stands as a monumental leap in decoding the brain’s mysteries.","Researchers used a poppy-seed-sized piece of the mouse’s brain to create a 3D reconstruction of the neural circuitry.

What led to the public fight between Elon Musk and Navarro

White House on Elon Musk's calling Navarro 'Moron'

Donald Trump's key trade adviser Peter Navarro has reportedly brushed off public humiliation from Tesla CEO Elon Musk . Peter Navarro is regarded as a key architect of the 'Reciprocal Tariffs' announced by the US President Trump. Talking to NBC News, Navarro denied that there are any tensions between him and Elon Musk. Navarro laughed off the reports that there is an issue between the two men. “Everything’s fine with Elon,” Navarro told NBC News’, adding with a laugh.When an NBC journalist pressed about Musk publicly calling him a 'Moron', Navarro said, “I’ve been called worse.” He then went on to add, ""Elon and I are agreeing. It’s not an issue.""Elon Musk, who is seemingly not happy with Trump Tariffs, publicly criticised Navarro last week. It started after responding to a post on him on Twitter, Elon Musk posted, and then deleted, a comment saying Navarro’s PhD from Harvard is a “bad thing,” and that he hasn’t “built sh*t.”Just days later, in an interview with CNBC when asked about Musk’s stated support for reducing barriers to trade, Navarro said, “We all understand in the White House, and the American people understand, that Elon’s a car manufacturer.” “But he’s not a car manufacturer, he’s a car assembler in many cases.” He then went on to explain that Musk imports parts from Japan, China and Taiwan. “The difference is, in our thinking and Elon’s on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron,” Navarro added. “We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here.”Elon Musk slammed Navarro over his CNBC interview. He went on to criticize Navarro in a series of posts on Twitter. Musk first called Navarro a “moron,” before adding that Tesla “has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.” He went on to add a sarcastic apology, saying that the comparison was “so unfair to bricks.”The White House, for its part, ignored Musk’s comments. “These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing.","Donald Trump's key trade adviser Peter Navarro has reportedly brushed off public humiliation from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

CEO Andy Jassy on the 'why' question he has to answer everyone even after staying at Amazon for 28-plus years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-andy-jassy-on-the-why-question-he-has-to-answer-everyone-even-after-staying-at-amazon-for-28-plus-years/articleshow/120257906.cms,"Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy emphasizes the critical role of persistent questioning, or ""WhyQ,"" in the company's success. He believes this mindset, nurtured through practices like banning PowerPoint and drafting press releases early, helps deconstruct problems and unlock innovation.

Why the “WhyQ” is important for Amazon CEO Andy Jassy



In Amazon 's relentless culture of innovation, one skill stands above all others according to CEO Andy Jassy – the ability to persistently ask ""why."" This questioning mindset , which Jassy has dubbed ""WhyQ"" or ""YQ,"" has become a fundamental pillar of Amazon's $2 trillion success story. ""Amazon has an unusually high quotient of this WhyQ , and it frames the way we think about everything that we do,"" Jassy wrote in his recent shareholder letter.""Now, with almost 28 years and counting at Amazon, I have to answer those same friends with their own Why question,"" Jassy wrote in his recent shareholder letter where he emphasized the importance of what he calls ""WhyQ"" or ""YQ"" — the ability to question everything.The 57-year-old chief executive, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, believes this questioning mindset has been crucial to both Amazon's $2 trillion success and his personal career trajectory since joining the company in 1997.""We ask why, and why not, constantly. It helps us deconstruct problems, get to root causes, understand blockers, and unlock doors that might have previously seemed impenetrable,"" Jassy explained.This tendency to question started early in his life. ""My dad has told me that I was the kind of kid who kept asking why, perhaps to an annoying extent,"" he admitted in his letter.Jassy believes Amazon's corporate culture intentionally nurtures this questioning mindset through specific practices, including banning PowerPoint presentations in meetings and writing press releases for products before they're even developed.""This might bother some regimented folks,"" he acknowledged. ""But, when we're inventing, we accept the process being beautifully imperfect.""The chief executive has previously emphasized the importance of attitude in career development, particularly for younger workers. ""An embarrassing amount of how well you do, particularly in your twenties, has to do with attitude,"" Jassy told LinkedIn in an earlier interview.Looking ahead to Amazon's expansion into AI and streaming , Jassy believes this questioning approach will become even more vital: ""In the nearly 28 years I've been at Amazon, the biggest difference in the relative growth of companies and individuals has been their aptitude to learn.""He argues that maintaining a high ""YQ"" isn't just nice to have but essential for organizational success : ""It needs to be built deeply into your culture and leadership team, and has to be fiercely protected over time if you're lucky enough to be successful.""","Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy emphasizes the critical role of persistent questioning, or ""WhyQ,"" in the company's success.

Nandan Nilekani's AI warning for 'Every day life'

India to be home to 1 million startups by 2035

India is firmly positioned in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race and is now focused on scaling its national AI initiatives, said Nandan Nilekani , co-founder of Infosys and architect of Aadhaar, during the Global Technology Summit on Friday. Nilekani emphasized that while India may not yet have developed large-scale AI models like some other countries, significant progress is already underway.""Indians should not worry about not having developed large AI models like some other countries. We should not be losing sleep because somebody has not built any AI models,” he said. “The Indian AI mission is active, and now the focus must shift to scaling it up.” He underscored that the current AI wave marks a major shift from earlier technology revolutions. “For the first time, we are placing our trust in non-human intelligence. In the past, technology followed predictable rules; now, we’re expecting machines to make decisions. That’s a major leap of faith,” he noted.Despite the excitement around AI, Nilekani warned that integrating the technology into everyday systems won't be straightforward. “Adopting AI is not going to be easy. It requires just as much, if not more, effort than previous technologies,” he said. “You have to reengineer workflows in both enterprises and government to make AI truly effective. It demands extensive upgrades, though the core principles still apply.”However, he believes India’s digital transformation over the past 15 years gives it a competitive advantage.“Given our current tech infrastructure, the gap between global AI developments and India’s progress is narrowing rapidly,” he said. “Enterprise AI will be a long journey, and public sector adoption will be even tougher due to structural limitations.”Nilekani also painted an ambitious picture for India’s startup landscape. He predicted the country could be home to one million startups by 2035, a dramatic jump from just 2,000 in 2015.“From 2,000 startups in 2015 to 150,000 today—we’re in the midst of a virtuous cycle,” he explained. “Startups solve real-world problems, scale up, go public, and spark the creation of more startups. This cycle is accelerating innovation across sectors like climate, energy, and space.”He celebrated India’s growing private innovation in sectors traditionally led by the state, highlighting the country’s “fabulous” space narrative as an example.Nilekani also revisited some milestones in India’s digital public infrastructure journey. These include: Aadhaar reaching 1 billion people; UPI launch, Reliance Jio disrupting the telecom sector, demonetisation reshaping financial behavior and BHIM app launch.“These were not overnight developments. They were years in the making,” he said. “You need patience to lay the foundation. Once it's in place, transformation can happen rapidly—and now, we’re more prepared than ever.”",Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani spoke at the Global Technology Summit.

Kraft Heinz joins the 'Saucy fun'

Education Secretary Linda McMahon reportedly caused a stir at the ASU+GSV Summit recently when she repeatedly confused artificial intelligence (AI) with A1, the popular steak sauce, during a panel on educational innovation. As reported by USA Today, McMahon, 76, initially used the term AI correctly, stating, “AI development – how can we educate at the speed of light if we don’t have the best technology around to do that?” However, her remarks soon veered off course. “A school system that’s going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching in every year. That’s a wonderful thing!” she said, prompting chuckles from the audience.She continued, “Kids are sponges. They just absorb everything. It wasn’t all that long ago that it was, ‘We’re going to have internet in our schools!’ Now let’s see A1 and how can that be helpful.”The gaffe didn’t go unnoticed. A.1. Sauce, owned by Kraft Heinz, seized the moment with a cheeky Instagram post featuring a bottle of their product and the caption, “You heard her. Every school should have access to A.1.” The post added, “Agree, best to start them early.” Fans loved the response, with one commenter noting, “I will be buying a bottle or two because of this post.”Online, the mix-up became fodder for jokes. One Twitter user quipped, “Education Secretary Linda McMahon keeps referring to AI as A1 and talking about how it will help ‘students at all levels.’ But how can we get those kids to drink it? Linda added, ‘The smarter kids can move up to Thousand Island Dressing.’”The Kraft Heinz-owned brand A.1. Sauce joined the fun. Taking a lighthearted jibe at McMahon's blunder the brand posted on their Instagram verified account, ""You heard her. Every school should have access to A.1.""

Donald Trump’s signature dance step video at Miami goes viral

Elon Musk recently attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event in Miami. Sharing a post on Twitter, Musk wrote “At the @UFC fight in Miami!”. He quoted a post by the official Twitter handle of UFC. The Tesla CEO sat ringside alongside President Donald Trump and his son Lil’ X. The trio were joined by FBI Director Kash Patel; Secretary of State Marco Rubio, formerly a senator from Florida; Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard; and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was accompanied by his wife, actress Cheryl Hines. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, was also part of the Trump entourage.Musk shared one photo from the event on his Twitter timeline, showing Trump and his son X.The video left netizen’s in awe. One user commented “Little X!! I don’t think he could possibly be any cuter”. “Looks like a photo for the ages,” said another, while a third user replied “Elon is the kinda friend, Donald always missed having”.Notably, this is the second UFC event that Trump attended since he was elected for a second time in November last year. As the president entered the Kaseya Center in Miami to applause and cheers, he broke into his signature celebratory dance. The brief routine, featuring slow air punches and a subtle hip sway, mirrored Trump’s usual rally moves set to the song “YMCA” by the Village People.The moment from the Miami event quickly went viral with clips of the dance spread across social media.Commenting on the viral video, a user wrote “The GOAT having a blast!”. Others described the moment as “iconic” or “legendary,” with some saying they were glad to see Trump enjoying himself.“No one can match the vibe of Trump,” wrote another.","Elon Musk recently attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event in Miami.

A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”In response, Walmart defended its contributions to communities and the economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year.”The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further added that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

Marco Rubio's Cable also has specific dates

Visa types specified in the Marco Rubio's cable

What you post on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media platforms has never been more important as it seems now. Especially, if you are planning to apply for the US visa. The United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly ordered diplomats abroad to scrutinize the social media content of some applicants for student and other types of Visas. According to a report in The New York Times, quoting the US government officials, the aim of scouring social media accounts of the US Visa applicants is an effort to Ban those who are suspected of criticising the US and Israel from entering America.The US Secretary of State Rubio reportedly laid out the instructions in a long Cable sent to diplomatic missions across the world on March 25. Rubio’s directive reportedly said that starting immediately, consular officers must refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to the “fraud prevention unit” for a “mandatory social media check”. For those unaware, the fraud prevention unit of an embassy’s or consulate’s section for consular affairs helps screen applicants.The cable sent by Marco Rubio reportedly described the broad parameters that diplomats should use to judge whether an applicant needs to be denied a visa. It is said to specify a type of applicant whose social media posts should be scrutinized. These reportedly include: Someone who is suspected of having terrorist ties or sympathies; who had a student or exchange visa between October 7, 2023, and August 31, 2024; or who has had a visa terminated since that October date.The dates specified by Marco Rubio in the Cable are said to indicate that one of the main aims of the social media searches is to reject the applications of international students who have expressed sympathy for Palestinians during the war.The Cable further states that the applicants can be denied a visa if their behavior or actions show they bear “a hostile attitude toward U.S. citizens or U.S. culture (including government, institutions, or founding principles).”The requested visa types that would set off extra scrutiny as per the Cable are reported to be: F, M and J, which is student and exchange visitor visas. The details of the Cable were first reported by an independent news site, 'The Handbasket'.In mid-March, a State Department spokesperson reportedly said in an email that “all available technology” was being used to screen visa applicants and visa holders. The spokesperson made the comment replying to a question from The New York Times about whether the department was using artificial intelligence to scan databases and social media posts to find visa holders to decide those whose visa should be revoked.","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly laid out the instructions in a long Cable sent to diplomatic missions across the world on March 25.

Bryan Johnson says he has quit a drug popular in anti-ageing circles after it actually accelerated his aging process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bryan-johnson-says-he-has-quit-a-drug-popular-in-anti-ageing-circles-after-it-actually-accelerated-his-aging-process/articleshow/120240974.cms,"(Pic courtesy: Youtube/ Bryan johnson)

The drug that Bryan Johnson says accelerated his aging process

Anti-aging influencer Bryan Johnson , known for his extreme $2 million annual health regimen aimed at reversing aging, has publicly admitted that a key component of his protocol, the drug Rapamycin, may have been detrimental to his health. In a recent YouTube video, the 46-year-old biohacker revealed he experienced several negative side effects after five years of carefully adjusting his Rapamycin dosage.The immunosuppressant, initially developed for organ transplant recipients, gained popularity in anti-aging circles due to studies suggesting it could extend lifespan by targeting the mTOR pathway. Johnson was inspired by research showing increased lifespan in mice and improved health outcomes in a human trial.However, instead of the anticipated rejuvenation, Johnson suffered from mouth ulcers, slow-healing wounds, elevated cholesterol, and blood glucose spikes. Most concerning was a sustained increase in his resting heart rate, a crucial metric for his recovery and sleep quality. These physiological changes prompted him to discontinue the drug.Adding to his concerns, a recent Yale University study challenged the purported anti-aging benefits of Rapamycin, suggesting it might actually accelerate biological aging by negatively impacting epigenetic markers.Despite the setback, Johnson stated that stopping Rapamycin was a ""reset,"" not a surrender, emphasizing the importance of sharing both successes and failures in the pursuit of understanding how to slow aging. He acknowledged the irony of a central element of his meticulously planned regimen potentially causing harm, stating, ""To those of you laughing at home, I’m laughing with you."" Johnson maintains that his approach is part of a scientific exploration, accepting the risks involved in trying to identify interventions that genuinely impact the aging process.","Bryan Johnson, known for his extreme $2 million annual health regimen aimed at reversing aging, has publicly admitted that a key component of his protocol, the drug Rapamycin, may have been detrimental to his health.

"Apple, tech sector get relief: Smartphones, laptops excluded and other key electronics exempted from Trump Tariffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-tech-sector-gets-relief-smartphones-laptops-excluded-and-other-key-electronics-exempted-from-trump-tariffs/articleshow/120236285.cms,"Phones, PCs, chips exempted from Trump’s reciprocal tariffs

The US Customs and Border Protection has released new guidelines that specify certain technology devices and components will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs initiated by US President Donald Trump . The latest notice comes as previous action had raised significant concerns for technology companies, most notably Apple , which manufactures the majority of its iPhones and other products within China.According to a report by CNBC, the information was disseminated late Friday (April 11) evening. The latest guidance is a direct response to President Trump's earlier decision to impose a 145% tariff on products originating from China.The newly-issued tariff guidance identifies a range of electronics that will receive exclusions. This list includes laptops, semiconductors, solar cells, flat panel television displays, flash drives, memory cards, and solid-state drives, all of which are used for data storage.Notably, these products may be subject to future duties. These exemptions represent a somewhat favourable outcome for technology companies such as Apple. As per data from Evercore ISI, Apple manufactures over 80% of its products in China, including 80% of iPads and more than half of its Mac computers.Recently, Apple experienced a loss of over $640 billion in market value in the period following President Trump's tariff announcement.Moreover, Apple reportedly chartered multiple cargo flights to ship an estimated 1.5 million iPhones, weighing approximately 600 tons, from India to the US. This move aimed at ramping up inventory in the home country to mitigate the potential impact of tariffs previously threatened by Trump.","US Customs and Border Protection has released new guidelines that specify certain technology devices and components will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs initiated by US President Donald Trump.

Donald Trump just gave Samsung a 'huge problem' and it is called Vietnam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-just-gave-samsung-a-huge-problem-and-it-is-called-vietnam/articleshow/120230325.cms,"Vietnam's role in Samsung's operations

Impact on Samsung and Vietnam

US President Donald Trump's latest tariff hikes have created a significant challenge for Samsung Electronics, with Vietnam emerging as a focal point of the escalating trade tensions. The new tariffs, which raise duties on Vietnamese exports to the US to 46%, threaten to disrupt Samsung's global supply chain and its reliance on Vietnam as a manufacturing hub.Vietnam has been a cornerstone of Samsung's manufacturing strategy since the South Korean tech giant entered the country in 1989. The company produces 60% of its global smartphone output in Vietnam, with many of these devices destined for the US, where Samsung is the second-largest smartphone vendor. Vietnam's $120 billion trade surplus with the US has now placed it squarely in the crosshairs of Trump's tariff policies.The tariff hike has exposed vulnerabilities in Vietnam's export-driven economy and Samsung's heavy reliance on the country. While Vietnam has secured a temporary reprieve with a 90-day pause on the full tariff implementation, the uncertainty has already prompted Samsung and its suppliers to explore alternative production strategies. Options include increasing output in India or South Korea, though these shifts would be costly and time-consuming.The tariffs not only jeopardize Samsung's operations but also highlight the risks of over-reliance on a single manufacturing base. Vietnam, which has benefited from companies diversifying away from China, now faces challenges such as rising labor costs, power supply issues, and the loss of earlier tax incentives.","Vietnam has been a cornerstone of Samsung's manufacturing strategy since 1989.

You’re NOT alone — #UPI is down across India!

Users are flooding Downdetector with complaints.

Payments failing.

Just finished lunch like a boss but when I tried paying via UPI—boom! Server down. Now I’m just sitting in hotel like a wanted criminal full stomach but cooked RIP to me! 💀

UPI is down again today, all payment are getting failed.

Atleast there should be prior intimation sent incase of planned outage.

So we can plan accordingly

UPI services appear to have returned to normal. Downdetector reports show a significant decrease in complaints, with only 225 at the time of writing. NPCI has not issued an update.UPI experienced yet another service outage, resulting in thousands of users reporting their inability to make payments and execute fund transfers. Downdetector reported a peak of over 2,200 user complaints concerning UPI services, primarily related to failed payment transactions and fund transfers.The disruption has affected a broad range of major payment platforms, including Google Pay , PhonePe , and Paytm, as well as various banking applications. Notably, the TOI Tech team's attempts to make payments and transfer funds were also unsuccessful.Downdetector's data further indicated reports of service disruptions affecting both State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI and HDFC as well as Google Pay, demonstrating the expanded reach of the technical difficulties.The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the entity responsible for the operation of the UPI network, has acknowledged the issue and said that it is working to resolve the disruption.""NPCI is currently facing intermittent technical issues, leading to partial UPI transaction declines. We are working to resolve the issue, and will keep you updated. We regret the inconvenience caused,"" NPCI said in a post on X.This disruption marks a recurrence of technical difficulties that have recently plagued the digital payment system, making this the third instance in a matter of about three weeks that the UPI service is down for a large number of users.The first instance occurred on March 26 when UPI users encountered challenges in completing their transactions. NPCI attributed these issues to an “intermittent technical issue.”At that time, NPCI acknowledged the disruption and subsequently reported that the system had been restored to normal operation. Subsequently, on April 2, Downdetector recorded hundreds of outage reports, with approximately half of the reported issues related to fund transfers.Social media, especially Elon Musk-owned X, is flooded with memes and posts on the outage.","Third UPI disruption in about three weeks.

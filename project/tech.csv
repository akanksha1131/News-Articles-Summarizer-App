Taiwan warns: These Chinese apps are sending users' data to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taiwan-warns-these-chinese-apps-are-sending-users-data-to-china/articleshow/122272433.cms,"How NSB found out Chinese apps are sending data to China

Ban on Chinese apps across the world

Taiwan's National Security Bureau (NSB) has warning for users of Chinese apps. In an advisory, NSB said that China-developed apps like RedNote (Xiaohongshu), Weibo, TikTok, WeChat and Baidu Cloud pose security risks due to excessive data collection and data transfer to China. The alert reportedly comes following an inspection of these apps carried out in coordination with the Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) and the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the National Police Agency.NSB said that the results indicate the existence of security issues, including excessive data collection and privacy infringement. It further warned, ""The public is advised to exercise caution when choosing mobile apps."" NSB also pointed out that companies operating in China are obligated to turn over user data under domestic laws for national security, public security, and intelligence purposes. So, using these apps can breach the privacy of users.The agency said that it evaluated Chinese apps against 15 indicators spanning five broad categories: Personal data collection, excessive permission usage, data transmission and sharing, system information extraction, and biometric data access.According to the analysis, RedNote violated all 15 indicators, followed by Weibo and TikTok that were found to breach 13 indicators. WeChat and Baidu Cloud violated 10 and 9 of the 15 indicators, respectively.These issues encompassed extensive collection of personal data, including facial recognition information, screenshots, clipboard contents, contact lists, and location information. All the apps have also been flagged for harvesting the list of installed apps and device parameters.""With regard to data transmission and sharing, the said five apps were found to send packets back to servers located in China,"" the NSB said. ""This type of transmission has raised serious concerns over the potential misuse of personal data by third-parties.""Taiwan's warning comes after several nations across the world have banned or restricted certain Chinese apps. In June 2020, India announced ban almost 100 Chinese-made apps, citing national security concerns. In November 2024, Canada ordered TikTok to dissolve its operations in the country.Last week, one of Germany's data protection authorities asked Apple and Google to remove Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot DeepSeek from their respective app stores. The Germany's data protection authourity accused DeepSeek of unlawful user data transfers to China. Several other countries too have announced similar restrictions on DeepSeek.","Taiwan's National Security Bureau (NSB) has warning for users of Chinese apps.

"Avoid entering US via ... airport, instead fly into ..., reads Harvard University advisory to international students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/harvard-university-to-international-students-avoid-entering-us-via-this-airport-instead-fly-into-/articleshow/122266875.cms,"Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts may be reviewed by authorities

Harvard University's special travel advice to students from Iran and China

Tensions between Harvard and the White House

Google Pixel 9 Pro After 1 Year: Still a Flagship Worth Buying in 2025? | Long-Term Review

Harvard University has advised international students to avoid entering the U.S. through Boston’s Logan International Airport and instead consider flying into alternatives like New York’s JFK, due to increased scrutiny at Logan. The university also urged students to be cautious about their social media activity and the content on their electronic devices while travelling. The warning comes after the university secured a preliminary court injunction blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to stop it from enrolling foreign students. According to a Bloomberg report, the advice was given during a private call, hosted by Harvard’s international office and a Harvard Law School immigration support group. Students who joined the call told the publication that the session was aimed to provide guidance on how to avoid visa and immigration issues.During the call, Harvard staff told students that the US State Department officials can review social media accounts as part of the visa process. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials also have the authority to inspect personal electronic devices, such as phones and laptops, and may deny entry based on the content found.“It’s not clear whether this assessment is done by people or artificial intelligence,” Harvard representatives reportedly told students. They added that “pro-Palestinian, antisemitic or posts derogatory of the US” appear to be among the kinds of content that could raise red flags. Students were also informed that previous run-ins with law enforcement, even for minor offenses, could draw attention.The university staff also warned that wiping a device clean before travel might raise suspicions.As per the report, students from Iran and China were given additional advice. Jason Corral, a staff attorney at Harvard Law School’s immigration and refugee clinic, reportedly advised Iranian students in particular to avoid Logan Airport, where they have faced higher levels of scrutiny. “At this time there is not enough evidence to say definitively that any airport is better or worse,” Corral said, but noted that New York’s JFK, Chicago O’Hare, and Los Angeles International airports might be better options for arrival.According to students on the call, Harvard representatives said those studying subjects like science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or anything related to artificial intelligence should be especially cautious when traveling.Harvard has been on the radar of the Trump administration’s push to change higher education. In addition to challenging the school’s ability to admit international students, the administration has canceled over $2.6 billion in federal research funding and has questioned the university’s tax-exempt status. The administration initially cited antisemitism as a concern but has since broadened its criticism to include Harvard’s diversity programs and alleged political bias.","Harvard University has advised international students to avoid entering the U.S. through Boston’s Logan International Airport.

US Attorney’s advice on how crypto investors can avoid such scams



“All donors should double and triple check that they are sending cryptocurrency to their intended recipient. It can be extremely difficult for law enforcement to recoup lost funds due to the extremely complex nature of the blockchain.”

“business email compromise scam,”

A hacker allegedly used ""fake"" Donald Trump inauguration emails to steal over $250,000 in cryptocurrency from a crypto investor, federal officials have claimed. The scam involved an online fraudster posing as part of the US President’s 2025 inaugural committee. In a complaint filed in a federal court in December 2024, prosecutors alleged that scammers sent emails ""purporting to be Steve Witkoff,"" who was then the co-chair of the committee. These emails were used to steal over $250,000 worth of USDT.ETH cryptocurrency. According to court documents, the victim paid the funds, and the cryptocurrency was soon distributed across ""numerous other cryptocurrency addresses,"" including a Binance account based in Nigeria linked to the name Ehiremen Aigbokhan .In a statement, Washington US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said:Companies and digital currencies linked to the alleged scam, including Binance and Tether, responded to FBI requests later that month by freezing accounts holding portions of the stolen funds. Federal prosecutors are now moving to seize approximately $40,000 in cryptocurrency spread across two accounts that remain untouched.Authorities claim the funds were obtained through wire fraud and money laundering .Federal officials described the operation as aexplaining that the suspect manipulated email domain names by replacing an uppercase “I” with a lowercase “L” to mimic the official @t47lnaugural.com address.Trump and Witkoff, who currently serve as a special Middle East envoy for the administration, are involved in several legitimate cryptocurrency ventures, including World Liberty Financial, which they launched alongside their sons last year.","Scam involved an online fraudster posing as part of the US President’s 2025 inaugural committee.

Infosys HR sends 'detailed warning email' to employees: We must work….”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-hr-sends-detailed-warning-email-to-employees-we-must-work-/articleshow/122264746.cms,"Infosys monitors remote work hours to prevent burnout

Health concerns drive policy shift in Indian IT sector

India's second-largest IT services company Infosys has begun sending personalized warning emails to employees who exceed standard working hours, directly contradicting founder N.R. Narayana Murthy 's recent advocacy for a 70-hour workweek. The Bengaluru-based firm has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.""We must work for 9.15 hours a day for five days a week, and if we overshoot this while working remotely, it prompts a trigger,"" an employee told The Economic Times. The company's HR department now tracks remote working hours monthly, sending detailed notifications to staff members who exceed prescribed durations.The monitoring system was introduced following hybrid working arrangements for Infosys's 323,500 employees. When excessive hours are detected, HR sends comprehensive notifications including information about remote working days, total hours worked, and daily averages. The company's workplace policy, implemented in November 2023, requires staff to be present in office for minimum 10 days monthly.""While we appreciate your commitment, we also believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for both your well-being and long-term professional success,"" states the HR communication reviewed by financial dailies. The emails emphasize that prioritizing health and work-life balance benefits both personal wellbeing and professional success.This initiative emerges amid growing concerns about young tech professionals facing health challenges, particularly cardiac issues attributed to irregular dietary and rest patterns. The company's guidance includes specific recommendations: ""Take regular breaks during your workday; Let your manager know if you are feeling overwhelmed or need support with reviewing priorities.""The policy represents a significant departure from Murthy's recent statements calling for Indians to work 70 hours weekly to accelerate economic growth. The move reflects evolving workplace norms in Indian IT sector , where employee mental health and sustainable productivity are gaining prominence over extended working hours.","Infosys has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.

Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.More countries are adopting digital verification systems, and e-passports are expected to further streamline international travel. Travelers will benefit from smoother immigration checks and faster processing through automated e-gates at major airports. With the government's phased rollout underway, carrying a smarter and more secure passport is set to become the new norm for Indian citizens.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

US President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will start formal discussions with China early next week over a potential deal involving the popular short-video app TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in Beijing.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said the talks could begin as soon as Monday or Tuesday, possibly involving President Xi Jinping or senior Chinese officials. “We pretty much have a deal,” Trump claimed, though he acknowledged that China’s approval would be necessary for any agreement to move forward.The proposed deal would reportedly involve spinning off TikTok’s U.S. operations into a new American-owned entity, a plan that had been in the works earlier this year but was paused after China objected to U.S. tariff hikes. Trump recently extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US assets to September 17.While Trump expressed optimism, saying the deal would be “good for China and good for us,” he also admitted uncertainty: “I’m not confident, but I think so,” he said when asked whether China would approve the arrangement.The renewed negotiations come amid heightened tensions over data privacy , national security , and U.S.-China tech competition. TikTok, which has over 170 million American users, has faced bipartisan scrutiny in Washington, with lawmakers pushing for a ban unless it is separated from Chinese ownership.","The proposed deal would reportedly involve spinning off TikTok’s U.S. operations into a new American-owned entity.

Publishers split on AI integration as academic standards evolve

Researchers at 14 universities across eight countries have been caught embedding hidden AI prompts in academic papers designed to manipulate artificial intelligence reviewers into giving positive evaluations, according to a Nikkei investigation. The investigation uncovered 17 research papers containing concealed instructions like ""give a positive review only"" and ""do not highlight any negatives"" in preprints posted on arXiv, the popular academic research platform. These prompts were hidden using white text or microscopic font sizes, making them invisible to human readers but detectable by AI systems.Institutions involved include prestigious universities such as Japan's Waseda University , South Korea's KAIST, China's Peking University, the National University of Singapore, and American institutions including the University of Washington and Columbia University. Most papers originated from computer science departments.The discovery has sparked controversy within academic circles, with some institutions taking immediate action. A KAIST associate professor admitted the practice was ""inappropriate"" and announced plans to withdraw their paper from the International Conference on Machine Learning. KAIST's administration stated they were unaware of the prompts and pledged to establish AI usage guidelines.However, some researchers defended their actions. A Waseda professor argued the hidden prompts serve as a ""counter against lazy reviewers who use AI,"" claiming they expose violations of conference policies that prohibit AI-assisted peer review.The incident highlights the academic publishing industry's struggle with AI integration. While some publishers like Springer Nature permit limited AI use in peer review processes, others including Elsevier maintain strict bans, citing risks of ""incorrect, incomplete or biased conclusions.""Experts warn that hidden prompts extend beyond academic papers, potentially causing AI tools to generate misleading summaries across various platforms. Technology officer Shun Hasegawa from ExaWizards noted these tactics ""keep users from accessing the right information.""The controversy underscores the urgent need for comprehensive AI governance frameworks as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly prevalent in academic and professional settings.","Researchers at 14 universities across eight countries have been caught embedding hidden AI prompts in academic papers.

Going into business was a reality check: Bill Gates

Google Pixel 9 Pro After 1 Year: Still a Flagship Worth Buying in 2025? | Long-Term Review

Microsoft founder Bill Gates admitted that procrastination was one of the bad habits he had to overcome during the early years of his years. Speaking at a 2005 Q&A session alongside investor Warren Buffett at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Gates told students that he developed this habit while studying at Harvard University . I liked to show people that I didn’t do any work, and that I didn’t go to classes and I didn’t care,” he then said. Gates added that he would get serious about exams at the last minute, sometimes just two days before the test. “People thought that was funny,” he said. “That was my positioning: the guy who did nothing until the last minute.”However, things changed after he entered the business world. “When I went into business that was a really bad habit and it took me a couple years to get over that,” Gates said, drawing laughter from the audience.In a 2016 Ask Me Anything Reddit post, Gates was asked about his best memory at Harvard. He said: “I decided that I would be different and never attend any class I was signed up for but always attend a class I wasn’t signed up for.”When asked how he managed to pass his classes, Gates replied that he simply studied “really hard” during reading period- the time given just before final exams. Gates said that by following tis strategy, he always received As. In an organic chemistry class, faulty video recordings of lectures led him to a C+. “That spooked me,” he admitted.During a panel discussion at the University of Nebraska, Gates admitted that going into business was a sobering reality check. “Nobody praised me because I would do things at the last minute,” he said.

Not every CEO have job apocalypse warnings

Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley has become the latest Fortune 500 executive to publicly warn that artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of white-collar jobs across America. Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley predicted that ""artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the US"" and that ""AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind.""Farley emphasized the growing disconnect between technological advancement and workforce preparation, noting that ""we have to acknowledge that these new technologies are great"" but questioned ""what are we going to do as a society for the people that it leaves behind that are valuable humans?""The Ford CEO’s stark warning joins a growing chorus of major corporate leaders who are abandoning previous cautious language about AI's job impact. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June to expect corporate workforce reductions due to ""once-in-a-lifetime"" AI technology, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted half of entry-level jobs could disappear within five years, potentially driving unemployment to 10-20%.The shift represents a dramatic change from executives' previous tendency to hedge when discussing AI's employment impact. JPMorgan Chase CEO Marianne Lake told investors the bank's operations headcount could fall 10% due to AI tools, while Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has halted hiring unless managers can prove AI cannot perform the job.Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman warned his staff that AI threatens all white-collar roles, from programmers to lawyers, writing ""AI is coming for you."" ThredUp CEO James Reinhart believes AI ""will destroy way more jobs than the average person thinks.""Not all tech executives share these dire predictions. OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap told podcasters he hasn't seen evidence of wholesale entry-level job replacement, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed widespread displacement warnings as ""overly alarmist."" However, the growing consensus among major CEOs suggests significant white-collar job disruption may be inevitable as AI capabilities rapidly advance.","Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley is the latest Fortune 500 executive to publicly warn that artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of white-collar jobs.

Arrest of Huawei founder's daughter in Canada

A U.S. federal judge has reportedly ruled that Huawei Technologies , China’s leading telecommunications equipment manufacturer, must face a sweeping 16-count indictment accusing the company of stealing trade secrets, racketeering, wire and bank fraud, and violating U.S. sanctions . U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly rejected Huawei’s motion to dismiss the charges, calling the company’s arguments premature in a 52-page ruling, according to court documents.According to a report by news agency AP, the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) alleges that Huawei and its subsidiaries engaged in a concerted effort to steal American trade secrets, installed surveillance equipment that aided Iran in monitoring protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations, and conducted business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions. The 2019 indictment also charged Huawei with using a Hong Kong shell company, Skycom, to sell equipment to Iran in violation of sanctions, and accused its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou , of misleading HSBC about Huawei’s Iranian dealings.Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but was released in 2021 as part of a prisoner swap that freed two Canadians detained by China. Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling. The case, which intensified during former President Donald Trump’s administration, saw the U.S. raise national security concerns and urge Western allies to exclude Huawei from their high-speed wireless networks. Chinese officials have countered, accusing the U.S. of “economic bullying” and using national security as a pretext to suppress Chinese companies. Huawei’s legal team argued the allegations were vague and some charges improperly applied U.S. law extraterritorially.Facing U.S. sanctions that have restricted access to American processor chips and technology, Huawei, the world’s largest network gear maker, has pivoted to developing its own chips and focusing on the Chinese market. The company has also expanded into network technology for hospitals, factories, and other industrial sectors less affected by U.S. restrictions. The ruling sets the stage for a high-profile legal battle as Huawei confronts the serious allegations in the U.S. federal court.","A U.S. federal judge has reportedly ruled that Huawei Technologies must face a sweeping 16-count indictment.

"When Steve Jobs visited Moscow as he was 'looking for something to do', making a trip that made it to FBI files",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-visited-moscow-as-he-was-looking-for-something-to-do-making-a-trip-that-made-it-to-fbi-files/articleshow/122256947.cms,"Apple founder Steve Jobs reportedly made a trip to Moscow. When? In 1985, when Moscow was part of Soviet Union and shortly after reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev‘s rise to power. According to a report in Cult of Mac, in a trip to the Soviet Union in 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs aimed to bring Macintosh computers to Russia. The two-day visit saw Jobs lecturing computer science students, attending a Fourth of July party at the American embassy, and discussing the possibility of establishing a Mac factory in Russia.The trip came at a tumultuous time for Steve Jobs, who had been sidelined at Apple after a power struggle with CEO John Sculley. Seeking purpose, Jobs embarked on an overseas journey that included stops in Paris, Italy, and Moscow. In Paris, he met future U.S. President George H.W. Bush, discussing how Macs could spark a “revolution from below” in the Soviet Union, where the less-powerful Apple II had recently launched.However, Jobs’ visit wasn’t without controversy. According to Walter Isaacson’s 2011 biography, Jobs nearly clashed with the KGB by praising exiled Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky, deemed an “enemy of the people” by the Soviet regime. Cult of Mac cites Isaacson, noting that a KGB agent warned Jobs against discussing Trotsky, saying, “Our historians have studied the situation, and we don’t believe he’s a great man anymore.” Undeterred, Jobs reportedly began a speech to Moscow computer students by lauding Trotsky, though a partial transcript of the speech omits this detail.Intriguingly, Jobs suspected the attorney organizing his trip might have ties to the CIA or KGB, a detail noted in his FBI file, which also mentioned his meeting with a Russian Academy of Sciences professor to explore marketing Apple products. Despite these, the trip reportedly yielded no Russian Apple division, aligning with what Cult of Mac describes as “busy work” to keep Jobs away from Apple’s management.A surprising outcome emerged, however. Apple VP Al Eisenstat, staying at the same Moscow hotel, received a floppy disk from a nervous programmer containing advanced handwriting-recognition software. The report adds that members of the Apple Newton team later confirmed this code became the foundation for the Newton MessagePad’s handwriting recognition feature. Though Jobs’ Soviet venture didn’t revolutionize Russia’s tech landscape, it remains a fascinating chapter in his storied career, blending ambition, intrigue and unexpected technological gains.","Apple founder Steve Jobs reportedly made a trip to Moscow in 1985.

USCBP wants new digital forensics tool amid rise in device searches



The United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is reportedly seeking assistance from tech companies to develop a digital forensics tool capable of analysing data from seized phones and computers, specifically to uncover ""hidden"" patterns. This initiative suggests the agency's aim to enhance its data processing capabilities. According to a report from Wired, a federal registry listing from June indicates that CBP is looking for a tool that can scan text messages, pictures, videos, contacts, and other information on devices confiscated at US borders. Apart from basic data processing, the agency wants a tool that can identify ""hidden language"" or coded terms within text messages that may not be immediately apparent.CBP is also looking for a tool to identify specific objects across videos and photos, and to quickly process data for ""intel generation,"" indicating a focus on extracting actionable intelligence from the collected information, the report claims.In 2015, the agency searched around 8,500 devices; by 2023, that number had risen to 41,500. CBP also conducted 4,200 advanced forensic searches in 2024, involving deep data analysis.While CBP currently uses tools from Israeli firm Cellebrite, it remains open to alternatives. As per the report, the agency already employs a variety of data extraction tools, suggesting it's not tied to one vendor.CBP agents have been known to request access to travellers' phones and other devices, particularly during border checks. This practice has prompted some visitors to use burner phones when travelling to the U.S. to avoid handing over personal data.In a recent request for information, CBP hinted that it plans to select a vendor and finalise a contract to develop the tool by the third quarter of 2026, with potential implementation following in 2027.","US Customs and Border Protection is reportedly seeking help to develop a digital forensics tool.

About the Thiel Fellowship

It's over for Taylor Swift. The Music Queen has lost her status as the youngest self-made billionaire woman. At just 30, serial entrepreneur Lucy Guo has surpassed pop icon Taylor Swift to become the youngest self-made woman billionaire, according to Forbes. This milestone coincides with a major financial leap for her former startup, Scale AI , which is nearing a tender offer set for June 1. The deal, valuing the AI data annotation firm at $25 billion‚Äîan 80% jump from its $13.8 billion valuation last May‚Äîallows early employees and investors to cash out shares.Guo co-founded Scale AI in 2016, a company pivotal to the AI industry, providing essential data organization for machine learning models. Its clients include the US government and OpenAI. A first-generation Chinese-American from the Bay Area, Guo taught herself to code in middle school, briefly attended Carnegie Mellon University, and then left to join the Thiel Fellowship , a $100,000 grant program for young entrepreneurs founded by Peter Thiel, popularly known as Donald Trump's man in Silicon Valley. In fact it was PayPal cofounder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel who introduced his mentee, JD Vance, to President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2021.Before Scale AI, Guo worked at Quora, where she met co-founder Alexandr Wang, and later at Snapchat. After leaving Scale, she launched Backend Capital, a venture capital firm, and invested in startups like Ramp, now valued at billions. In 2022, she founded Passes, a subscription-based platform for creators akin to OnlyFans, which has raised $50 million and is valued at $150 million. Celebrities like Olivia Dunne and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal use the platform. Passes is a platform enabling creators to monetize their brands through subscriptions, live streams, one-on-one calls, and fan management tools.Guo‚Äôs rise from a self-taught coder to a billionaire embodies the Silicon Valley dream, unseating Taylor Swift, 35, who held the title since Forbes named her a billionaire in 2023.Founded by Peter Thiel, the Thiel Fellowship provides $100,000 and mentorship to young innovators who skip or leave college to pursue entrepreneurial ventures over two years. Incidentally, Thiel‚Äôs venture fund, Founders Fund, was also an early investor in several of Elon Musk‚Äôs companies, including space cargo business SpaceX, tunneling firm the Boring Company, and brain-chip startup Neuralink.","Lucy Guo, 30, has surpassed pop icon Taylor Swift to become the youngest self- made woman billionaire, according to Forbes.

Order Cancellations in Response to Tariffs

Third-Party Sellers Face Pricing Pressures

Signs of Consumers Stockpiling

From Amazon to Japanese manufacturers, businesses worldwide are racing to adapt to the Trump administration‚Äôs rapid tariff increases, which are reshaping global trade dynamics. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy , in a recent CNBC interview, vowed to shield customers from soaring costs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything we can to keep prices as low as possible,‚Äù Jassy said, acknowledging the strain tariffs place on businesses. ‚ÄúDepending on the country, you don‚Äôt have 50% extra margin to absorb these costs. Companies will likely pass them on to consumers.‚ÄùFollowing President Trump‚Äôs latest tariff announcements, Amazon swiftly canceled orders for goods from China and Southeast Asia, including beach chairs, scooters, and air conditioners, according to Bloomberg News. These products, purchased directly by Amazon for U.S. resale, were among the first casualties of the new trade policies.Amazon‚Äôs third-party marketplace, which accounts for 60% of its sales, includes millions of sellers, many reliant on Chinese manufacturing. Jassy predicted these merchants would raise prices to offset tariff costs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing sellers will pass that cost on to consumers,‚Äù he noted.In his annual shareholder letter, Jassy revealed Amazon‚Äôs proactive steps to cushion the tariff blow, including strategic bulk inventory purchases and renegotiated supplier contracts. These efforts aim to stabilize prices amid rising costs.Amazon has observed early indications of customers stockpiling goods to dodge expected price hikes. ‚ÄúPeople have not stopped buying and in certain categories, we do see people buying ahead, but it‚Äôs hard to know if it‚Äôs just an anomaly in the data because it‚Äôs just a few days, or how long it‚Äôs going to last,‚Äù Jassy said.","Businesses worldwide are racing to adapt to the Trump administration‚Äôs rapid tariff increases.

Schwarz stated, ‚ÄúWe are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.‚ÄùWalmart responded to the boycott, defending its contributions to communities and the US economy. ‚ÄúServing communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,‚Äù the company said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart‚Äôs decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households‚Äîa trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People‚Äôs Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

This Saturday, history was created in Beijing when twenty-one humanoid robots raced in the Yizhuang half-marathon . It was the first event where robots shared the stage with human runners in a 21-kilometre racetrack, a monumental leap in the development of robots and artificial intelligence. The competition attracted extensive coverage, showcasing advancements in humanoid robots and providing glimpses of future applications in other industries.The robots that participated were made by different Chinese robot makers, including well-known firms like DroidVP and Noetix Robotics. The robots varied in size and shape, offering a great range of designs for the public to view. Some of the robots stood at just 1.2 meters, while others reached a height of 1.8 meters. This difference in height and build illustrates the versatility of humanoid robots, indicating that there is no one formula for designing robots.Certain manufacturers advanced their design of robots a notch higher in terms of more human-like features. For example, one such manufacturer had a robot with a female face that was able to mimic similar human facial expressions such as smiling and winking. Customization for the robots also did not limit itself to looks since many also spent weeks preparing their robots in an attempt to give them flawless performance in the race.The race was not merely a race but also an exhibition of the technical and engineering advancement in the field of robotics. Beijing officials described the race as a motor race, referencing the pivotal role that was played by the engineering teams and navigation experts who piloted the robots through the competition. As a high-performance racing team is attached to each robot, there was a technical team attached to each robot that could manage its technical aspect so that the robot performed uniformly throughout the race.Witnesses were able to witness the sophistication and precision it requires for the robots to master the challenging 21kilometers route. He Sishu, an observer who works in the artificial intelligence field, commented, ""The robots are running well, very stable‚Ä¶ I feel I am seeing the upgrading of robots and AI."" This was a reflection on the general mood and perspective that this was a turning point for the advancement of humanoid robots and AI technology.Even though the robots were meant to run on their own, the majority of them continued to require trainers for support. Some of therobots required physical assistance, particularly when there was a technical issue, and the trainers had to intervene to help them stay on track. In some cases, trainers physically supported the robots in order to avoid them falling behind or getting stranded during the competition.Both in appearance and in gear, some of the robots had sneakers on their arms, others distinct accessories that continued to make them look better aesthetically. Some of the robots even sported boxing gloves, indicating a ""fighting attitude,"" another a red strap worn on the head with phrases printed on it, ""Bound to Win,"" which was Chinese as well. These lighthearted additions gave the robots character and showed how companies were trying to make the robots more human-like in order to appeal more powerfully to individuals. The Winner: Tiangong UltraTiangong Ultra, a robot that was built and designed by the Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, took part in the marathon. Tiangong Ultra won the race by coming in first to complete the 21kilometers within a mind-boggling 2 hours and 40 minutes. This is an extraordinary feat for a humanoid robot. Nonetheless, the human marathon champion took the race to completion in 1 hour and 2 minutes, which only further illustrated the disparity between robots and humans as far as running long distances is concerned.The Beijing Human Robotics Innovation Centre is a joint venture, with two state-owned companies owning 43% of its shares, and the robotics arm of tech titan Xiaomi and leader in humanoid robotics UBTech owning the remaining shares. The center's participation in this event is also an indication that China is investing heavily in robotics and aims to be a leader in the industry.Tiangong Ultra's victory can be attributed to several factors, such as its superior design and superior technology. Tang Jian, the chief technology officer at Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, attributes Tiangong Ultra's long legs as a key factor in its superb performance during the competition. Additionally, the robot possessed an advanced algorithm that allowed it to mimic the way humans run a marathon, enhancing its performance along the distance.Tang claimed, ""I don't boast but no other robot companies in the West have matched Tiangong's success on the sporting field."" He also explained that the batteries in the robot had to be changed three times while competing to ensure that it functioned for the entire 21kilometers.Despite the triumph, not every robot performed well. Some had mechanical issues from the start. One robot, for example, broke down at the start line and had to remain lying there for a number of minutes before it was able to start running again. Another robot had a crash early on in the event, which crashed into a railing and caused its human operator to lose balance and fall over. These problems were indicative of the teething issues that humanoid robots face as they are forced to operate in real-world environments. While the robots were impressive, it was clear that a lot of work was required to enhance reliability and performance under unpredictable conditions.","Twenty-one humanoid robots raced in the Yizhuang half-marathon.

What Italy and US said about European digital services taxes



Italy and the United States have issued a joint statement opposing what they described as ""discriminatory"" taxes on digital services. This reportedly indicates a potential shift in Rome‚Äôs approach to a measure that has drawn criticism from Washington. The announcement came as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met separately with US President Donald Trump and his deputy JD Vance. Trump‚Äôs reception of Meloni also appeared more welcoming than his interactions with other European leaders. European taxes targeting major U.S. tech companies like Alphabet's Google , Meta's Facebook, Apple, and Amazon have long been a source of concern for US administrations, including that of Trump.In a joint statement (reviewed by the news agency Reuters) following Meloni's visit to the White House, the US and Italy said: ""We agreed that a non-discriminatory environment in terms of digital services taxation is necessary to enable investments from cutting-edge tech companies.‚ÄùThe announcement also mentioned that Trump would make an official visit to Italy soon, however, it did not specify whether Rome had agreed to withdraw the digital services tax.It also expressed support for American investments in AI computing and cloud services in Italy, highlighting efforts to position the country as a central data hub for the Mediterranean and North Africa.Last year, Amazon‚Äôs cloud division, AWS, also announced a 1.2 billion euro investment over five years to expand its data centre operations in Italy.Italy imposes a 3% tax on revenue from online transactions by digital companies with global sales of at least 750 million euros ($853.35 million), generating less than 500 million euros in annual revenue for the state.According to a report by Reuters, Italy‚Äôs web tax remains a sensitive issue for Meloni, despite its relatively modest contribution to the state. While Meloni faces pressure from the US to revise the measure, the report cited political sources to claim that members of her ruling coalition are urging her to take a tougher stance on large tech companies to help finance costly policies without putting more pressure on Italy‚Äôs public finances.Recently, Italy‚Äôs economy Minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, said that discussions with the US over digital taxation should take place bilaterally rather than through the European Union, the report added. He mentioned that he plans to meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent next week during a G20 meeting.","Italy and the United States have issued a joint statement opposing what they described as ""discriminatory"" taxes on digital services.

What the lawsuit alleges

A man from Pennsylvania has filed a lawsuit against a political group linked to Elon Musk . The lawsuit, filed on April 1 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that the group promised to pay him for collecting voter petition signatures but did not send the full amount. The group named in the lawsuit is called America Political Action Committee (PAC), and is connected to Elon Musk‚Äôs political campaign efforts. The campaign focused on states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It encouraged voters to support petitions about free speech and gun rights.The lawsuit says the PAC promised to pay $100 for each voter signature collected and another $100 for each new person referred during the 2024 election campaign. The man says he was paid his hourly wage and some of the referral payments, but about $20,000 is still unpaid.The man says he contacted the PAC many times to ask for the rest of the money but got no reply. The lawsuit says he suffered emotional stress and health issues because he could not pay his bills and his credit was damaged.The lawsuit says over 100 others may also be owed money. If true, the total amount could be more than $5 million.Speaking to Business Insider, plaintiff attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan said, ‚ÄúOur client relied on that promise because he believed in Elon, but unfortunately, that promise was not kept. It appears the promise was broken for many others as well. He relied on these payments to pay his bills‚Äîbut they never came.‚ÄùAmerica PAC spokesperson Andrew Romeo told Business Insider that the organization ‚Äúis committed to paying for every legitimate petition signature‚Äù and has ‚Äúpaid tens of millions of dollars to canvassers.‚Äù Romeo added that while they cannot verify John Doe‚Äôs specific claims, the PAC has the right to withhold payments from ‚Äúfraudsters.‚Äù","A man from Pennsylvania has filed a lawsuit against a political group linked to Elon Musk.

Aadit Palicha, CEO of quick-commerce startup Zepto, shared a stark account of the company‚Äôs near-demise during the 2022‚Äì2023 funding drought, citing hiring errors and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse as major threats, according to the Economic Times. In a conversation with Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, Palicha pinpointed flawed recruitment as Zepto‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel. ‚ÄúThe biggest mistakes I made were wrong hires,‚Äù he told Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, noting missteps in finance, operations, marketing, and category management that strained the startup‚Äôs early years.The March 2023 SVB collapse, which froze funds for numerous tech firms, hit Zepto hard. ‚ÄúWe almost died,‚Äù Palicha admitted, recalling the existential crisis when operational funds were trapped in the bank. A WhatsApp poll cited by ET revealed 40 Y Combinator-backed Indian startups had $250,000 to $1 million in SVB, with over 20 holding more than $1 million, amplifying the panic.Zepto, like many global startups, was hit hard by the sudden collapse of US-based SVB in March 2023. The bank, which held deposits for thousands of tech firms, folded amid a liquidity crunch‚Äîfreezing access to funds and triggering widespread panic among founders.In a LinkedIn post, Palicha credited Y Combinator‚Äôs support as pivotal to Zepto‚Äôs survival and growth. The startup has since rebounded, with ET reporting its annualised gross order value nearing $4 billion -- a 300% year-on-year leap‚Äîand FY24 operating revenue of Rs 4,454 crore, up 120% from the prior year.Palicha said the ordeal reshaped Zepto‚Äôs hiring strategy. ‚ÄúThe most fundamental input to our company is execution excellence, and the biggest driver of that is high-quality people,‚Äù he emphasized, underscoring a new focus on ‚Äúexecution intelligence‚Äù in team-building.","Aadit Palicha, CEO of quick-commerce startup Zepto, shared a stark account of the company's near-demise during the 2022‚Äì2023 funding drought.

Google confirms Gemini will replace Assistant on Android in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-confirms-gemini-will-replace-assistant-on-android-in-2026/articleshow/126096509.cms,"Transition timeline



Google initially planned to complete the upgrade by the end of 2025.

The company now says the migration will continue into 2026, citing the need to avoid disruption during the holiday season and to ensure feature parity between Assistant and Gemini.

The rollout is expected to be gradual and region-based, rather than an immediate global switch.

What Gemini brings



Already available on Wear OS, Google TV, and Android Auto, Gemini is expanding into smart speakers and displays via the Gemini for Home Early Access program.

The platform integrates advanced features like NotebookLM support, AI video detection, and semantic search, positioning it as a more powerful replacement for Assistant.

Why the delay



Feature Parity: Ensuring Gemini incorporates all of Assistant’s core functions before migration. Timing: Avoiding major platform changes during the holiday season, when disruption could frustrate users.

Context and significance



Google Assistant first launched in 2016, making the 2026 replacement symbolic as it marks a decade of service.

The move underscores Google’s broader strategy to embed Generative AI deeply into everyday consumer experiences.

For users, the shift promises smarter search, richer media integration, and more natural interactions, though some may miss the familiarity of Assistant.





Google has announced that its Gemini AI platform will fully replace Google Assistant on Android devices in 2026, pushing back its earlier timeline to allow for a more seamless migration. The change will affect Android phones, tablets, and even the standalone iOS app, which will be phased out once Gemini takes over.Gemini represents Google’s next-generation AI assistant, designed to deliver more conversational, visual, and context-aware experiences.Google has not provided a detailed explanation, but industry observers suggest two main reasons:","Gemini represents Google’s next-generation AI assistant, designed to deliver more conversational, visual, and context-aware experiences.

Former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick resigns from Meta’s board,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-trump-adviser-dina-powell-mccormick-resigns-from-metas-board/articleshow/126091371.cms,"



Facebook-parent Meta announced that Dina Powell McCormick has stepped down from its board of directors, just eight months after joining, the company said on December 19. Powell McCormick, a former deputy national security adviser in Donald Trump’s first term, resigned with immediate effect, as stated in a report by Reuters.A person familiar with the matter told the news agency that while she is leaving the board, she may continue to advise Meta in a broader role focused on investments and strategic guidance. The source added that Meta does not plan to fill her vacant board seat.Powell McCormick previously spent 16 years in senior leadership roles at Goldman Sachs, where she led the firm’s sustainability, inclusive growth and impact investing initiatives. She has also served in high-level positions in two U.S. administrations — as a senior adviser in the George W. Bush White House and as assistant secretary of state under Condoleezza Rice.Meta appointed Powell McCormick and Stripe CEO Patrick Collison to its board in April as part of its plan to expand to 15 members. The board currently includes Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, and Tony Xu, CEO of DoorDash.In a related news, Meta is working on new AI image and video generation tools, reports The Wall Street Journal. Citing people familiar with the topic, the report says that Meta’s chief AI officer Alexandr Wang talked about the artificial intelligence models in an internal company Q&A with Meta’s chief product officer, Chris Cox this week. One of the tools is reportedly codenamed ‘Mango’. Another AI model is codenamed ‘Avocado’. Speaking about the Avocado model, Wang said that the focus of the upcoming new AI model is to improve coding skills. The new models are expected to be released in the first half of 2026.The upcoming Meta’s AI image and video tools will compete with Google's Nano Banana and Veo, and OpenAI's ChatGPT Image and Sora.","Dina Powell McCormick, a former deputy national security adviser in Donald Trump’s first term, resigned with immediate effect.

"Europe's biggest aerospace company Airbus wants to move critical systems away from AWS, Google and Microsoft; 'fear' this American law",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/europes-biggest-aerospace-company-airbus-wants-to-move-critical-systems-away-from-aws-google-and-microsoft-says-fear-this-american-law/articleshow/126098000.cms,"What is America's Cloud Act

Microsoft admission in French court





Europe's biggest aerospace company Airbus reportedly wants to move away from two of the biggest American technology companies -- Google and Microsoft. According to a report in Register, Airbus is preparing to tender a major contract to migrate mission-critical workloads to a digitally sovereign European cloud. The aerospace manufacturer uses products and services of Google and Microsoft. Airbus has consolidated its datacenter estate and uses services like Google Workspace. The company reportedly uses Microsoft Excel and software for finance and some miliary-classified documents that can't be stored in the CloudAirbus is now reportedly looking to move key on-premises applications including ERP, manufacturing execution systems, CRM, and product lifecycle management (aircraft designs) to the cloud. ""I need a sovereign cloud because part of the information is extremely sensitive from a national and European perspective,"" Catherine Jestin, Airbus' executive vice president of digital, told The Register. ""We want to ensure this information remains under European control,"" Jestin added.Digital sovereignty is said to have become more critical since Donald Trump's return to the White House in January. While Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google have created solutions to address these concerns, fears persist about the US CLOUD Act, which allows authorities to request data held by American corporations in overseas datacenters.For those unaware, Digital sovereignty is a nation's ability to have the final say over its own digital destiny -- the way it controls its infrastructure, its data, and the digital services operating on its own terms. It’s about ensuring that local laws govern the cloud operations and controls where data is located, who can access it, and how it’s managed.Cloud Act is a law that gives the US government authority to obtain digital data held by US-based tech corporations irrespective of whether that data is stored on servers at home or on foreign soil. It is said to compel these companies, via warrant or subpoena, to accept the request. The Cloud Act was signed into law in 2018 following challenges the FBI faced when getting data via service providers through Store Communications Act warrants, which was itself legislated before cloud computing became a viable thing.Microsoft admitted in French court last July it couldn't guarantee data sovereignty under this legislation. However, Microsoft has said that it has not received data requests from the US government for data held on Microsoft servers in Europe. Back at the hearing in France, Microsoft was asked if a data request was well framed, would the corporation be ""obliged to transmit the data?"" Carniaux admitted: ""Absolutely, by respecting this process. But again, this has not affected any European company, or a public sector body, since we have been publishing these transparency reports.""",Aerospace company Airbus reportedly wants to move away from Google and Microsoft.

Jared Isaacman, the newly confirmed NASA Administrator, issued a clear ultimatum to the billionaire-led companies racing toward the lunar surface, on his first official day leading the world’s premier space agency. Between choosing Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos Blue Origin, Isaacman said that the company that finishes its lander first gets the lunar mission. The statement comes as the US pushes to return humans to the moon for the first time in more than half a century.Speaking with Bloomberg TV this week, just one day after his Senate confirmation, Isaacman made it clear that “strategic objectives” take precedence over contract history.“I don't think it was lost on either vendor that whichever lander was available first to ensure that America achieves its strategic objectives on the moon is the one we were going to go with,” Isaacman said.This effectively makes the Artemis program into a high-stakes sprint. While SpaceX’s Starship was originally designated for the Artemis III mission in 2027, delays have left the door open for Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lander to take the spotlight.In October, then-acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy officially reopened SpaceX’s lunar contract, saying that Musk’s company was “behind schedule” on the modified Starship lander.Musk lashed out at Duffy on social media, labeling the official a ""dummy"" and asserting that SpaceX would ultimately complete the entire moon mission independently. SpaceX and Blue Origin are the font runners in Lunar missions:SpaceX (Starship HLS): A massive, reusable vertical-landing craft based on the Starship rocket.Blue Origin (Blue Moon): A multi-stage lander designed for precision touchdown.The pressure on NASA and its private partners has intensified with a new executive order signed by President Donald Trump, who demands that the US establish a permanent lunar outpost and operational nuclear reactors on the moon by 2030.","Jared Isaacman, newly confirmed NASA Administrator, issued a clear ultimatum to the billionaire-led companies racing toward the lunar surface.

As the Silicon Valley ‘AI talent war’ escalates into a multi-billion dollar bidding power struggle, Google has successfully deployed a ‘boomerang’ strategy to bring its top minds back to the company. While rivals like Meta and OpenAI are offering astronomical signing bonuses as mush as $100 million, Google is winning back its former staffers with a different kind of currency: Robust computational infrastructureCiting data, CNBC reported that approximately 20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were former employees. This suggests that for the world’s elite engineers, the ability to build is becoming more valuable than a massive immediate paychecks.The report also said that during a recent internal meeting, Google’s head of compensation, John Casey, addressed the trend directly, noting that AI researchers are increasingly drawn back to Google's “deep pockets” and its unparalleled “hefty computational infrastructure.”Google is uniquely positioned as an “all-in-one” provider with its own Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), a Cloud to host AI models, and even products to help it infuse its AI services, giving it an edge that cash alone cannot buy.“We’re energized by our momentum, compute and talent. Engineers want to work here to keep building groundbreaking products,” a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying.Apart from salary and infrastructure, Google has spent months in eliminating over one-third of middle-management roles to speed up product shipping. Co-founder Sergey Brin came out of retirement to personally call and recruit top-tier candidates. More recently, the success of Gemini 3 has provided the company an edge after a rocky start in 2022.Recently, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who is the co-founder of DeepMind, also acknowledged the shortage of AI talent, saying that this has led to a constant “rotation” of experts between the “Big Five” tech firms.","20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were former employees.

US lawmakers to Pentagon: 'Ban' these technology companies for links to Chinese army; read full letter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-lawmakers-to-pentagon-ban-these-technology-companies-for-links-to-chinese-army-read-full-letter/articleshow/126093448.cms,"US President Trump Signs AI Power Order: Blocks States, Cites Urgent Threat From China

What is Pentagon’s 1260H list

Letter signed by 9 US lawmakers seeking to ban DeepSeek , Xiaomi and other Chinese firms

Dear Secretary Hegseth:

We write to urge you to expand the Department’s list of Chinese military companies maintained pursuant to Section 1260H of the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to include a set of Chinese firms that support “military-civil fusion” (MCF) and advance People’s Liberation Army (PLA) capabilities across various sectors, including: biotechnology and life sciences; sensing, surveillance, and robotics; consumer smart devices; large-scale AI models; displays and imaging; semiconductors and manufacturing equipment; and power batteries and energy storage.

We applaud recent actions taken by the Department, including the addition of Tencent to the

1260H list in January 2025 as well as reports that an October 7 letter from Deputy Secretary of

War Stephen Feinberg informed the Armed Services Committees that Alibaba, Baidu, and BYD

should be added to the list of companies that aid the PRC’s military.

The firms listed below represent military-civil fusion contributors central to PLA modernization,

internal-security operations, and power-projection capabilities. Their designation under Section

1260H would directly support Congress’ intent that U.S. taxpayer funds not underwrite PRC

military-industrial and internal-security or intelligence capabilities.





Nine US lawmakers have sent a letter to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking a ‘ban’ on 17 Chinese companies. In the letter, the lawmakers urged Pentagon (now Department of War) to add these companies to its 1260H list over alleged links to the Chinese military. List of companies that the letter includes are Chinese AI firm DeepSeek; smartphone maker Xiaomi , chip companies Hua Hong Semiconductor, Kingsemi and Shennan Circuit; display and imaging companies BOE Technology Group and Tianma Microelectronics; sensing, surveillance and robotics firms CloudMinds, LeiShen, Livox, RoboSense, Tiandy Technologies, Unitree Robotics and others.In the letter, the lawmakers said that the firms “represent the next logical tranche of military-civil fusion contributors whose designation under Section 1260H would directly support Congress’s intent that US taxpayer funds not underwrite PRC military-industrial and internal-security or intelligence capabilities”.The letter is signed by: John Moolenaar, Chairman, Select Committee on China; Rick Scott, Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging; Eric A. “Rick” Crawford, Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; Andrew R. Garbarino, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security; Rob Wittman, Chairman, House Armed Services Committee, Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee; Bill Huizenga, Chairman, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, South & Central Asia Subcommittee; Dusty Johnson, Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development Subcommittee; Darin LaHood, Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Subcommittee on NSA and Cyber; Andy Ogles, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee.Pentagon’s 1260H list is a US Department of Defense roster of Chinese military-linked companies that are believed to support China’s defence or intelligence activities. It is required under Section 1260H of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.Companies on the list face increased scrutiny, restrictions on US government contracts, and potential sanctions. The list is used to warn US entities against doing business with firms tied to China’s military–civil fusion strategy.The letter, dated December 18, 2025 reads:","Nine US lawmakers have sent a letter to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking a ‘ban’ on 17 Chinese companies.

Mustafa Suleyman’s AI system warning





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.He warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.",Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ He also said that Copilot is “amazing for vision.

Bernie Sanders targets Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg



Electricity-hungry data centers



He noted Meta’s planned Louisiana facility could consume three times more power than New Orleans.

A Texas project tied to OpenAI and Oracle could use electricity equivalent to 750,000 homes.

Another Meta site could match the needs of 1.2 million households.





US senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has reignited his feud with Tesla CEO Elon Musk . Sanders posted a video on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) in which he has questioned Musk’s ambitious claims about artificial intelligence and robotics ushering in a ‘utopia’. In the video messaged posted Sanders directly asked Musk, “You have told us poverty will be wiped out, work will be optional, and there will be universal high income for everyone. How will this utopia come about?” Sanders pressed further, asking: “When are they going to get the free housing? When will factory workers receive free healthcare if robots take over manufacturing jobs?”. Moreover, Sanders also accused Musk and other “oligarch friends” of promising a magnificent life for working people without explaining how it would be delivered. He also criticised US President Donald Trump for doubling insurance premiums and reducing SNAP benefits, framing Musk’s promises against broader economic challenges.This new video messages by Bernie Sander is followed by recent call made by Sanders for a moratorium on AI datacenters, citing risks to jobs, democracy, and public resources. Elon Musk responded to Sanders demand and called him a ‘coward’ who lacked ‘any sense of adventure’.However, Sanders found support from Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who argued that AI should benefit workers rather than “tech barons,” despite representing Silicon Valley.Recently, Sanders escalated his criticism of the artificial intelligence boom and has asked for a halt on new AI data center construction. Sanders has also accused the tech billionaires including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates for driving the AI expansion for “dangerous reasons.” In a video posted on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Sanders warned that AI and robotics are growing faster than the society can adapt.“AI and Robotics are the most transformative technologies in the history of humanity,” he said, cautioning they will affect “every man, woman and child” in the country.Sanders’ moratorium call zeroes in on the massive electricity demands of AI infrastructure.Sanders singled out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Peter Thiel, and other tech leaders, arguing they are pushing AI to consolidate wealth and power rather than protect working families. “These very, very rich men are not losing sleep over job losses or inequality,” he added.",US senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has reignited his feud with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Elon Musk gives timeline of first Starship flight to Mars with humans and self-sustaining Mars city

Elon Musk shares timeline of first Starship flight to Mars





SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has once again started the discussion about interplanetary colonisation with a fresh prediction about Mars. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk wrote, “Mars will be green with life one day”, hinting at his vision of the Red planet’s as humanity’s next frontier. Elon Musk has consistently argued that making life multiplanetary is essential for humanity’s survival. His latest statement on Mars adds to a series of bold predictions he made in the past. Musk believes that humans will create self-sustaining cities on Mars and he feels that millions of people will be living there by mid-century. However, the exact timeline of life reaching Mars still remains uncertain, but the comments made by Musk continue to fuel speculation about SpaceX’s roadmap to Mission Mars.Elon Musk-owned SpaceX is presently testing its Starship rocket which is designed to carry large payloads and crews to Mars. The company has already conducted multiple orbital flight tests, with plans to refine reusability and deep-space capabilities. Also, Musk has earlier suggested that the first crewed Mars mission could happen in the 2030s. However, experts caution that technological, financial, and safety hurdles remain.In August this year, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared an important update on the timeline for sending Starship to Mars. In social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk said that there’s only a ‘slight chance’ of a crewed Starship flight to Mars by late 2026. He also mentioned that a more realistic schedule pointes to an unscrewed mission in 2028 and a human flight around 2030. “Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that,” Musk wrote. “More likely, first flight without humans in ~3.5 years, next flight ~5.5 years with humans. Mars city self-sustaining in 20 to 30 years.A user on X asked Musk about the timeline of Starship flight. “What’s the timeline you have set Elon? It sounds fascinating and I am glad to be alive when this is happening,” an X user named @abhiyogi asked.Responding to the post, Musk wrote, “Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year.

Apple's visionary founder Steve Jobs is said to be hooked on to the idea that everyone should be able to own a home computer. At the time, Jobs was in his early twenties and only problem to this vision was that like many founders, he didn’t have enough money to bring his vision to life. So Jobs sold off his Volkswagen bus while fellow cofounder Steve Wozniak got money for his programmable calculator. Togethers the duo raised $1,300 to pay for the prototype’s parts. And the first Apple computer, the Apple I, was born on April Fools’ Day, 1976, rest is history.A local computer dealer reportedly placed a $50,000 order for 100 units for Apple 1. While in all the sales were not huge, enough money to create Apple II for the mass market. The experience of selling Apple 1 showed Jobs there was a market for a real computer -- the Apple II.If it weren’t for a Volkswagen bus and a calculator, Apple might never have existed. At the time, the late cofounder Steve Jobs was in his early twenties and strapped for cash, but hooked on the idea that everyone should be able to own a home computer. The only problem? Like many founders, he didn’t have enough money to bring his vision to life.Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak reportedly started their first business, illegally selling “blue boxes” that allowed users to make free, long-distance telephone calls. In a documentary 'Silicon Valley: A 100-Year Renaissance' in 1998, Steve Jobs said, 'If we hadn’t … made blue boxes, there would have been no Apple.” As to what these Blue Boxes were? As a report in Fortune titled 'Unusual jobs CEOs had before they became successful', said: ""In the 1970s, telephone systems were far different than today. They used tone signals to control long-distance dialing. Jobs and his friend and Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, had their first business: illegally selling so-called blue boxes that would allow people to break into the telephone system and make free calls. ""If it hadn't been for the blue boxes, there would have been no Apple,"" he said in a 1994 video interview. ""I'm 100 percent sure of that. Woz and I learned how to work together, and we gained the confidence that we could solve technical problems and actually put something into production.""Jobs too remembered about those years in the early 1970s as a “magical” time in his life that sent him on the path to soon create Apple.","Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak reportedly started their first business, illegally selling “blue boxes” that allowed users to make free, long-distance telephone calls.

'You Are Wrong': How ex-engineers of the European chip giant whose CEO said China is way behind may have proved him incorrect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/you-are-wrong-how-ex-engineers-of-the-european-chip-giant-whose-ceo-said-china-is-way-behind-may-have-proved-him-incorrect/articleshow/126090606.cms,"China has reportedly built a working prototype of an advanced chip-making machine, defying Western predictions. Former ASML engineers are said to be behind the project, which aims for semiconductor independence. This development, a six-year government initiative, could significantly alter global chip supply chains, challenging ASML's monopoly on crucial EUV technology.

Former ASML engineers built China's prototype using reverse engineering

China recruited ASML veterans with fake IDs and million-dollar bonuses

ASML monopolizes EUV technology that powers AI chips and military systems





In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have achieved what Washington spent years trying to prevent and what Europe's leading chip equipment maker said was impossible: building a working prototype of an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine, dubbed “China’s Manhattan Project,” capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones, and advanced weapons systems. The breakthrough, as reported by Reuters, could prove ASML's CEO dramatically underestimated China's semiconductor capabilities.The prototype, completed in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, was reportedly built by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's technology. While ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said in April that China would need ""many, many years"" to develop such technology, Reuters reports suggest Beijing may be years closer to chip independence than Western experts anticipated.The machine fills nearly an entire factory floor and is operational, successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, though it has not yet produced working chips, according to two people with knowledge of the project who spoke to Reuters. The Chinese government has set a target of producing working chips by 2028, though sources close to the project say 2030 is more realistic—still years ahead of the decade-long timeline many analysts had projected.The breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative described by sources as China's version of the Manhattan Project. Huawei plays a key coordinating role across a web of companies and state research institutes involving thousands of engineers, Reuters reported.According to Reuters, the team includes recently retired Chinese-born former ASML engineers recruited with signing bonuses starting at $420,000 to $700,000. One veteran engineer received a fake identification card along with his signing bonus, and found other former ASML colleagues also working under aliases to maintain secrecy.The project falls under China's semiconductor strategy run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission. ""The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,"" one source told Reuters. ""China wants the United States 100% kicked out of its supply chains.""EUV machines are critical for producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones, and weapons systems. ASML is currently the only company that has mastered this technology, with machines costing around $250 million each. The company told Reuters it took nearly two decades and billions of euros before producing its first commercially-available chips in 2019.ASML CEO Fouquet has repeatedly downplayed China's semiconductor capabilities. In December 2024, he told Dutch media that China is currently 10 to 15 years behind the West in chipmaking. ""By banning the export of EUV, China will lag 10 to 15 years behind the West,"" he said. ""That really has an effect."" In February 2025, he told The Wall Street Journal that export controls remain effective despite advances like DeepSeek's AI model. ""If you don't have the most advanced technology at hand, you won't be as good as the people who have it,"" he insisted.The United States has blocked ASML from selling EUV systems to China since 2018, restrictions that expanded under the Biden administration in 2022. No EUV system has ever been sold to a customer in China, ASML confirmed to Reuters.Yet export restrictions have struggled to contain China's ambitions. The country has been salvaging components from older ASML machines and sourcing parts through secondhand markets to build its prototype, with networks of intermediary companies sometimes masking the ultimate buyer, sources said. International banks regularly auction older semiconductor fabrication equipment, with auctions in China selling older ASML lithography equipment as recently as October 2025, according to a review of listings on Alibaba Auction.ASML told Reuters it ""vigilantly guards"" trade secrets and has ""successfully pursued legal action in response to the theft of trade secrets."" The company won an $845 million judgment in 2019 against a former Chinese engineer accused of stealing trade secrets, but the defendant filed for bankruptcy and continues to operate in Beijing with Chinese government support, according to court documents.The Shenzhen prototype suggests that China's biggest breakthrough in the semiconductor race may have come not from circumventing Western export controls, but from the very engineers who built the technology those controls were designed to protect.","China has reportedly built a working prototype of an advanced chip-making machine, defying Western predictions.

Amazon names new AI chief





Amazon recently held its annual event AWS re:Invent. The conference is an annual gathering for the cloud community, featuring keynotes, technical sessions, and innovation talks. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's on-demand cloud platform. CEO Matt Garman spoke with Acquired podcast hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal at the event. Garman spoke about a range of subjects, this includes Generative AI, how AWS thinks about its product strategy, changing workforce in the times of AI and more.As reported by GeekWire, Garman was blunt about what Amazon seemngly doesn’t do well. He was replying to a question on what he thinks Amazon is not-so-good at. Garman said Amazon is “particularly bad” at copying competitors. “One of the things that Amazon is particularly bad at is being a fast follower,” he said. “When we try to copy someone, we’re just bad at it.” AWS CEO went on to add that the the better formula, he said, is to think from first principles about solving a customer problem, only when it believes it has differentiated expertise, not simply to copy existing products.The hosts also asked Matt Garman to quantify how much of AWS is now AI-related. To this, Garman said that it is getting harder to say, as AI becomes embedded in everything.In the third quarter of 2025, Amazon said that revenue in its cloud computing business increased 20%, exceeding analysts’ estimates. The company said that revenue at Amazon Web Services for the third quarter totaled $33 billion. Operating income rose 9% from a year ago to $11.4 billion, also beating estimates and accounting for about two-thirds of Amazon’s total operating profit. Amazon's cloud revenue rose at the fastest clip in nearly three years, helping the company forecast quarterly sales above estimates. The vast majority of Amazon’s revenues are generated through the sales of electronics and other products, followed by third-party seller services and AWS.“AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022,"" CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement. ""We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity.""Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said he expected full-year capital expenditures to be around $125 billion, and higher next year, without providing details. The company booked $89.9 billion in capital expenditures through the first three quarters, largely on AI projects.Amazon recently announced reorganization of teams working on artificial intelligence projects, putting a top leader from the company’s cloud division in charge of a new unit.

What the Delaware Supreme Court said in its order reinstating Elon Musk’s 2018 pay package

“We reverse the Court of Chancery’s rescission remedy and award $1 in nominal damages. The Plaintiff’s attorneys are awarded fees and expenses based on quantum meruit and a four times multiplier and post-judgment interest on the revised fee award from December 2, 2024. Any disputes regarding fees and expenses should be brought to the Court of Chancery for resolution. Jurisdiction is not retained,”

“The court relied on Valeant Pharmaceuticals v. Jerney147 in support of its finding that the Defendants had the burden of offering a viable alternative to total rescission. That case is distinguishable. In Valeant, the Court of Chancery considered a plan to give options to parent company executives in an entity that was to be spun-off where the executives would have no involvement in the ongoing enterprise. There, the former director and president of the company were sued, together with the former Chairman and CEO and other members of the board, after they decided to pay themselves large cash bonuses in connection with a later-aborted corporate restructuring.

The only non-settling defendant was the president who received a $3 million bonus,”

""First, unlike the rescission remedy here, the trial court in Valeant ordered the remedy of disgorgement of the president’s $3 million bonus. Disgorgement and rescission are remedies that have different purposes and prerequisites. The goal of rescission is to unwind a transaction and restore the consideration exchanged by the parties to their original positions, whereas disgorgement prevents unjust enrichment by a fiduciary who has breached their duty of loyalty. “Disgorgement focuses on the defendant’s gain from illegal conduct. It is the act of giving up something (such as profits illegally obtained) on demand or by legal compulsion”,”.

“Unlike rescission, disgorgement does not require that all parties to the challenged transaction be returned to the status quo ante. In Valeant, the president’s unjust enrichment was remedied by depriving him of the bonus, and the court did not consider whether he was restored to his prior position.”

“Second, in Valeant, the court rejected limiting the director’s bonus to the “extent that the bonus was unfair,” finding that the director had already been adequately compensated for his years of service. Valeant distinguishes Technicorp International II, Inc. v. Johnston, where the court had permitted reasonable compensation for eleven years of service to unfaithful fiduciaries after stripping them of profit from their misdeeds.

”

“Unlike in this case, the disgorgement of the president’s entire bonus in Valeant was not a rescission of his entire compensation package. Rather it rescinded a bonus paid to management based solely on the development of a stand-alone entity. The court referred to the bonuses as “event bonuses” which “could be viewed as compensation for past services.”

“Unlike Musk, whose compensation was tied to performance and achievement of specific milestones, the bonuses in Valeant “were being paid to parent company managers who would have no further involvement in the ‘spun’ company.” This fact prompted the court to conclude that “[w]hen viewed from this perspective, it is difficult to see how such large bonuses could be justified.” By contrast, the court here rescinded the entirety of the Musk’s compensation package, even though Musk had achieved all the required milestones in the six years since it was approved.”

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026





Google has asked some of its employees in the US to not travel abroad amid the H-1B visa row. According to a report by Business Insider, the company's outside counsel, BAL Immigration Law has sent an internal memo which says that workers who require a new visa stamp to re-enter the US risk being stuck overseas for months because many embassies and consulates are experiencing severe appointment backlogs. The memo said that U.S. embassies and consulates are reporting visa stamping delays of up to 12 months, and recommend that affected employees avoid international travel unless absolutely necessary. The advisory affects workers on H-1B, H-4, F, J, and M visas.""Please be aware that some US Embassies and Consulates are experiencing significant visa stamping appointment delays, currently reported as up to 12 months,"" the memo read.Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of State enforced the new social media screening rules. The department confirmed to Business Insider that it is now conducting “online presence reviews for applicants,” adding that embassies may reschedule appointments as resources shift, and applicants can request expedited processing in limited situations.The publication quotes a a spokesperson for the Department of State who said that consulates worldwide, including in India, are placing greater emphasis on detailed vetting over speed, resulting in longer wait times.Immigration firms have also reported postponed visa appointments in countries such as Ireland and Vietnam.""While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,"" the State Department spokesperson told the publication.The department has started social media screening of H-1B applicants and family members on dependent visas.

Here’s the full post shared by Starlink

On December 17, Starlink experienced an anomaly on satellite 35956, resulting in loss of communications with the vehicle at 418 km. The anomaly led to venting of the propulsion tank, a rapid decay in semi-major axis by about 4 km, and the release of a small number of trackable low relative velocity objects. SpaceX is coordinating with the @USSpaceForce and @NASA to monitor the objects.

The satellite is largely intact, tumbling, and will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and fully demise within weeks. The satellite's current trajectory will place it below the @Space_Station, posing no risk to the orbiting lab or its crew.

As the world’s largest satellite constellation operator, we are deeply committed to space safety. We take these events seriously. Our engineers are rapidly working to root cause and mitigate the source of the anomaly and are already in the process of deploying software to our vehicles that increases protections against this type of event.





Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink recently confirmed that one of its satellites lost communication after an anomaly in orbit on December 17. In a post shared on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), the company said satellite 35956 stopped responding at around 418 km altitude, leading to a venting of its propulsion tank and a sudden drop in its orbit. The event also caused the release of “a small number of trackable low-relative-velocity objects.”The company added that it is working with US Space Force and NASA to monitor the objects and assess their movement. While the satellite remains largely intact, Starlink added that it is tumbling and is expected to reenter Earth’s atmosphere and fully burn up within weeks.Starlink also clarified that the satellite’s path will stay below the International Space Station, and the incident poses no risk to the orbiting lab or its crew.","Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink recently confirmed that one of its satellites lost communication after an anomaly in orbit on December 17.

Replying to a question on if Amazon has not been a key part of a lot of AI narratives worry him? Also does he worry about Amazon not being in that narrative. Replying to the same, Garman said, ""I think both of those things are true. I do worry about it, because I don't want customers to think we're not innovating or driving the latest technologies they need. I want to make sure that it's not just headline-grabbing stuff and it's actually great.""He went on to quote what Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said and how that has shaped hi view. ""Jeff Bezos used to have a saying that you have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time. For us, I think that's what some of the last two years entailed. I think a lot of that narrative has changed now. If you talk to lots of analysts, if you talk to folks in the press, if I talk to customers they're saying, “Look, actually AWS has by far the strongest agentic platform to go build on.They have the broadest set of models that I can build on.

Chinese company responds to SpaceX VP who claimed that company's satellite risked colliding with Starlink; says: We do not ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-company-responds-to-spacex-vp-who-claimed-that-companys-satellite-risked-colliding-with-starlink-says-we-do-not-have-/articleshow/126084264.cms,"



Recently, a collision in space was narrowly averted when a newly deployed Chinese satellite came within a few hundred meters of one of the roughly 9,000 Starlink satellites currently operating in low Earth orbit. SpaceX blamed the satellite operator for not sharing location data. Michael Nicolls, VP for Starlink engineering, tweeted about the incident and put it on the lack of coordination from the Chinese launch provider CAS Space.“When satellite operators do not share ephemeris for their satellites, dangerously close approaches can occur in space,” wrote Michael Nicolls, VP of Starlink Engineering. “A few days ago, 9 satellites were deployed from a launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwestern China. As far as we know, no coordination or deconfliction with existing satellites operating in space was performed, resulting in a 200 meter close approach between one of the deployed satellites and STARLINK-6079 (56120) at 560 km altitude,” he wrote.CAS Space reported successfully launching nine satellites that day using its Kinetica-1/Lijian-1 rocket. The payload included six Chinese satellites, two other jointly-developed satellites for clients from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, along with a student-built satellite from Nepal.It seems that one of the satellites veered relatively close to a Starlink sat that’s been in service for over two years. “Most of the risk of operating in space comes from the lack of coordination between satellite operators —this needs to change,” Nicolls added.Responding to the same, CAS Space told PCMag it’s in contact with Nicolls to learn more about the “alleged incident.” However, the company noted: “We value the responsible use and sharing of space as the utmost priority. Situations like these are the reason why nations should work together in space, build their common understanding instead of segregating emerging nations.”The company said: ""As a launch service provider, our responsibility ends once the satellites are deployed, meaning we do not have control over the satellites' maneuvers. Nonetheless, it is everyone's common interest to avoid collision, so CAS Space will provide help however we can.""The company added: “Our first priority is to identify the exact timeline of the incident. Which of the nine satellites were involved? Did the incident happen during satellite deployment or during the orbit maneuver of one of the satellites? Once we have a clearer picture, we will be in a better position to provide assistance to Starlink.”In addition, the company asserted that “All CAS Space launches undergo a mandatory process to align our deployment sequence with ground-based space awareness systems to avoid any potential collision with known satellites/debris. Kinetica-1 Y11 launched at 04:03:45 UTC exactly to an SSO at 550 km with LTDN at 10:30. Satellite separation was nominal. No collision risks were reported for the deployment process. ”","A newly deployed Chinese satellite came within a few hundred meters of one of the roughly 9,000 Starlink satellites currently operating in low Earth orbit.

Facebook-parent Meta is working on new AI image and video generation tools, reports The Wall Street Journal. Citing people familiar with the topic, the report says that Meta’s chief AI officer Alexandr Wang talked about the artificial intelligence models in an internal company Q&A with Meta’s chief product officer, Chris Cox this week. One of the tools is reportedly codenamed ‘Mango’. Another AI model is codenamed ‘Avocado’. Speaking about the Avocado model, Wang said that the focus of the upcoming new AI model is to improve coding skills. The new models are expected to be released in the first half of 2026.The upcoming Meta’s AI image and video tools will compete with Google's Nano Banana and Veo, and OpenAI's ChatGPT Image and Sora.Meta has been pushing hard to lead the AI race. Earlier this year, the company restructured its AI team. The tech firm also hired AI chief Alexander Wang in a $14 billion deal, acquiring 49% stake in Scale AI.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has personally led the AI hiring drive, recruiting more than 20 researchers from ChatGPT maker OpenAI. He has build a team of over 50 newly recruited researchers, engineers and other AI specialists.In September this year, Meta released an AI video generator called Vibes.The development of Mango and Avocado marks the first major project from Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a new division formed after a major restructuring earlier this year.To build the group, CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a direct role in hiring, bringing in more than 20 researchers from OpenAI and appointing 28-year-old Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang to lead the team.The move shows Zuckerberg’s push to quickly catch up with competitors in the AI race. As part of this shift, Meta is reported to have spent more than $14 billion to buy a near-majority stake in Scale AI, putting Wang in charge of shaping Meta’s AI plans after its Llama models.",The Wall Street Journal reports that Meta is working on new AI image and video generation tools.

Citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter, news agency Reuters reported that the deal involves a commitment from Palo Alto Networks to pay a sum “approaching $10 billion” to Google Cloud over several years.While some of the spending will go into migrating Palo Alto's existing offerings to Google's platform, a larger chunk will go into adding new services that involve artificial intelligence, Palo Alto president BJ Jenkins told the news agency.“AI has spawned a tremendous amount of demand for security,” Matt Renner, chief revenue officer for Google Cloud, was quoted as saying. Jenkins highlighted the need of security by saying that AI is creating “new security threats that no one had ever imagined.”Amazon and Microsoft currently hold larger market shares: roughly 30% and 20% respectively. Google Cloud, however, is growing at a fast rate. Recent third-quarter earnings show Google Cloud’s revenue surged 34% year-over-year, outpacing Microsoft (28%) and AWS (20%).Google has taken the advantage of its own silicon (TPUs) and frontier models (Gemini), offering a “one-stop shop” for AI infrastructure that is proving to be advantageous to high-growth tech firms. Moreover, Google has started to offer its in-house TPU chip business directly to customers, including major AI labs like Anthropic, OpenAI and even Apple. Recently, a report that Meta is working on a deal with Google for its TPUs to train its AI models wiped nearly $250 billion from Nvidia’s market cap.By securing a $10 billion commitment from the world’s leading cybersecurity firm, Google is selling storage as well as embedding security into its infrastructure, likely providing another reason for companies to choose Google over its competitors.",Google Cloud and cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks have expanded their partnership.

Apple creates AI model that can turn 2D photos into 3D images: Here’s how it will work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-creates-ai-model-that-can-turn-2d-photos-into-3d-images-heres-how-it-will-work/articleshow/126079531.cms,"Image credit: Apple

Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

“We present SHARP, an approach to

photorealistic view synthesis

from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a

3D Gaussian representation

of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25–34% and DISTS by 21–43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.”

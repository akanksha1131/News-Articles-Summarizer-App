Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, closed in red on Friday. While Nifty50 went below 24,400, BSE Sensex plunged 800 points intraday. Nifty50 ended the day at 24,363.30, down 233 points or 0.95%. BSE Sensex closed at 79,857.79, down 765 points or 0.95%.Indian equities plunged with key indices seeing their sixth straight weekly decline. Multiple factors contributed to weakened market sentiment, including US President Donald Trump's sudden increase in tariffs on Indian exports, continued selling by overseas investors, and lacklustre first-quarter corporate results.Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited said, “The Indian equity market exhibited downward movement, closing at a three-month low amid growing concerns over the impact of US tariffs on Indian exports. FIIs remained net sellers, intensifying the pressure on domestic indices. The pessimism was broad-based, with realty and metals bearing the biggest brunt. Additionally, global financial institutions have begun revising India’s economic outlook downward, citing the adverse effects of the ongoing tariff concern. Growth projections for 2025 and 2026 have been lowered, reflecting heightened uncertainty surrounding India’s trade and macroeconomic environment.""Export-focused industries experienced significant losses after US President Trump increased tariffs on Indian exports to 50% in response to India's ongoing oil commerce with Russia. This unprecedented tariff increase on a US trading partner has significantly affected investor sentiment across various sectors.""The escalation from 25% to 50% tariffs will create sector-specific pressures rather than broad market disruption for Indian equities. The Nifty 50's limited 9% direct exposure to the US, primarily concentrated in IT services which remain exempt from goods-based duties, provides substantial insulation,"" said Nitant Darekar, Research Analyst at Bonanza.However, Darekar noted concerns for gems, jewellery, apparel, textiles, and chemicals sectors, which comprise a susceptible Rs 8,000 crore export segment.""The most-impacted sectors are textiles (Gokaldas/Kitex), Chemicals (Camlin, Aarti and Atul), and Auto Ancs (BHFC/Suprajit/Sona BLW), with direct export exposure to the US,"" said Seshadri Sen of Emkay Global according to an ET report.Morgan Stanley indicated that the Indian seafood export industry ""faces a potential loss of Rs 24,000 crore due to the US doubling tariffs to 50%. This move puts India at a significant disadvantage compared to competitors like Ecuador, impacting exporters and potentially farmers.""""Indian textile and apparel exporters are halting US order manufacturing due to President Trump's tariff doubling to 50%, severely impacting their competitiveness against nations like Bangladesh and Vietnam,"" Morgan Stanley said, forecasting ""export decline, job losses, and overall uncertainty in the sector.""The increased tariffs have resulted in suspended orders and reduced profit margins for exporters across textiles, seafood, gems and jewellery, chemicals and auto ancillaries sectors, potentially leading to additional consequences if the tariff situation continues.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have maintained their selling streak for ten consecutive sessions. Their withdrawal on August 7 amounted to Rs 4,997.19 crore from Indian equities, pushing the total August outflows beyond Rs 15,950 crore.The substantial $4 billion withdrawal since July indicates significant concerns. International investors are adjusting their positions due to changing risk-reward dynamics, particularly influenced by President Trump's increased tariffs. While domestic markets have not fully reflected these concerns, FIIs have taken decisive action.Quarterly corporate results have not provided any cushion against increasing worldwide pressure. The Nifty IT index declined 10% in the previous month, whilst Nifty Bank remained stagnant.According to an Economic Times study, the leading nine private banks in India recorded a modest 2.7% profit increase year-on-year in Q1, indicating reduced demand for loans and slow economic activity.""Domestic equity market navigated a volatile week marked by heightened uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations and subdued earnings,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments.The US dollar index experienced a significant 2.5% increase last week, surpassing the 100 threshold, marking its most substantial weekly advancement in approximately three years. This rise has elevated foreign debt expenses and accelerated capital departures from emerging markets.On Friday, the index registered at 98.188, showing a 0.2% increase, as the strengthening dollar continued to impact emerging market currencies and equity movements negatively.Despite current market challenges, technical analysis suggests possible near-term support levels. ""With 88% of Nifty 500 stocks bouncing at least 1% off the day's lows, a broad based recovery is in sight,"" said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.""The Nifty pausing not far from the key pivot of 24,590 is a sign of a measured upside move, which has the potential to evolve into a stronger push,"" he said.""But, we will begin with a limited upside view of 24670–717, with an intention to play larger upside aiming 24850–25000. Downside marker may be placed near 24548,"" James said.","Indian equities plunged with key indices seeing their sixth straight weekly decline. US President Donald Trump's sudden increase in tariffs on Indian exports, continued selling by overseas investors, and lacklustre first-quarter corporate results. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have maintained their selling streak for ten consecutive sessions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123179364,imgsize-93158,width-400,resizemode-4/123179364.jpg"

US stocks closed with mixed results as the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which affected numerous countries, was relatively subdued in global markets. The S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% after nearing its all-time high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 224 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased by 0.3%, reaching a new record.The S&P 500 experienced a slight decline of 0.1% after momentarily nearing its all-time high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 224 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite saw a 0.3% increase, reaching a new record.Concerns are mounting that President Trump's tariffs are negatively impacting the economy, especially following last week's disappointing job market report. However, optimism surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and a series of unexpectedly strong profit reports from major U.S. companies are helping to alleviate some of these worries, at least temporarily. Lower interest rates can stimulate the economy and boost investment prices, although they also carry the risk of increasing inflation. In a similar move, the Bank of England reduced its main interest rate on Thursday in an effort to support the struggling U.K.economy.The S&P 500 rose 0.5% in early trading, hovering just below its all-time high set last month while Dow gained 200 points and Nasdaq climbed 1%.However, the market eventually plunged into red as DJIA was dipped 355 points or 0.8%, trading at 43,837. Nasdaq followed the suit, falling to 21,157, shredding 0.06% or 12 points.Trump's new tariffs, which took effect Thursday morning, are seen as part of an ongoing trade push that has rattled markets and policymakers globally. Some nations are still in talks to reduce the tax rates on their exports, but for now, uncertainty remains the only constant on Wall Street.On Thursday, the Bank of England cut its main interest rate in an effort to support the struggling UK economy.The latest round of US tariffs, which came into effect on Thursday morning, were already expected and turned out to be lower than Trump had initially warned. Several countries are still trying to negotiate lower tax rates on their exports, while uncertainty continues to loom large on Wall Street.The latest reports on the US economy painted a mixed picture, keeping Treasury yields largely steady in the bond market.One report showed a slight rise in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week. While this may hint at an increase in layoffs, the figure still falls within its usual range.","The S&P 500 experienced a slight decline of 0.1% after momentarily nearing its all-time high earlier in the day.

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates are moving upwards as demand for safe haven assets stays in focus. Where are gold prices headed and what should investors do? Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:Gold October Futures on MCX extended their upward momentum in early trade, supported by strong buying interest and a technical breakout above key short-term resistance levels. The contract is currently trading around ₹1,01,930 after hitting an intraday high near ₹1,02,300. Market structure and momentum indicators favor a Buy on Dips approach, with ideal entry opportunities near ₹1,01,500 and a stop-loss at ₹1,00,800.The 8-period EMA (₹1,01,900) has crossed above the 21-period EMA (₹1,01,500), signalling bullish momentum. Price action is holding above both averages, suggesting that pullbacks to the ₹1,01,500 zone are likely to attract fresh buying.Price is trading near the upper band after a volatility expansion, indicating strong upside momentum. While short-term consolidation is possible, the broader bias remains positive unless the middle band (near ₹1,01,500) is breached decisively.Yesterday’s pivot levels place strong support around ₹1,01,500, which also aligns with EMA 21 and a previous breakout zone.This confluence makes it a key demand area for intraday traders.• RSI is holding comfortably above the 60 level, showing strength but not yet in extreme overbought territory.• MACD is in positive crossover territory, supporting continuation of the upward trend.A surge in volume during the breakout rally indicates strong participation from buyers. Open interest remains steady, hinting that positions are being built rather than liquidated.• Strategy: Buy on Dips• Entry Zone: ₹1,01,500–₹1,01,550• Stop-Loss: ₹1,00,800• Upside Targets: ₹1,02,300 followed by ₹1,02,800 if momentum sustains• Bias: Bullish until price closes below ₹1,01,500 on the 30-minute chartThe confluence of EMA support, positive momentum indicators, and strong volume-backed breakout suggests that gold remains in an intraday uptrend. Traders may look to accumulate on dips towards ₹1,01,500, keeping a tight risk management framework. A sustained move above ₹1,02,300 could open the gates for further upside in the short term.","Gold October Futures on MCX extended their upward momentum in early trade, supported by strong buying interest and a technical breakout above key short- term resistance levels.

Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, JSW Energy, and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for August 8, 2025:Benchmark indices experienced high volatility with a corrective bias, as investor sentiment turned cautious following US President Donald Trump’s executive order imposing an additional 25% import tariff on Indian goods. The action, prompted by India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, raises total US duties on certain Indian exports to 50%—among the steepest tariffs ever imposed on a trade partner by the US.Technically, the index has strong support in the 24,400–24,500 range. This zone aligns with multiple key indicators, including the previous swing low, the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), and a key Fibonacci retracement level of the recent uptrend.As long as Nifty holds above this support area, the ongoing consolidation phase between 24,400 and 25,000 is expected to remain intact. However, a decisive break below 24,400 may extend the current month-long correction towards the 200-day EMA near the 24,200 level in the sessions ahead.Currently, the 5% decline over the past five weeks has dragged weekly stochastic oscillators into oversold territory (reading near 5).If the index manages to sustain above the 24,400 levels amid continued volatility, it may trigger a technical pullback. It is worth noting that since the COVID-19 lows, the index has not recorded more than five consecutive weeks of declines without experiencing a rebound. Thus, traders are advised to avoid aggressive short positions at this stage.Structurally, the market remains in a secular bull trend. Historically, intermediate corrections driven by global and domestic uncertainties have provided healthy buying opportunities. We recommend investors remain calm amidst the current tariff-induced volatility and use this corrective phase to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong stocks with robust earnings.Bank Nifty traded within a narrow range with a corrective bias last week, as investor sentiment remained cautious amid ongoing tariff tensions between India and the U.S.The index is currently positioned at a crucial support zone between 55,200 and 54,900. This area coincides with the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) and key Fibonacci retracement levels from the previous uptrend, marking it as a significant demand zone.On the upside, resistance is expected in the 56,300–56,500 range, which aligns with the lower boundary of the recent breakdown area. A sustained move above this zone could signal a potential pause in the prevailing downtrend or an early sign of waning bearish momentum. Overall, the index is expected to trade within a defined range of 54,900 to 56,400 in the near term, with a clear directional move likely only after a decisive breakout from this range.The stock has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern over the past six months, typically continuation formation within broader trend cycles. The coiling of price within this triangular structure suggests a state of equilibrium between demand and supply forces, and we anticipate an imminent breakout on the upside as the apex of the triangle is approached.The projected price target from this anticipated breakout stands at ₹598, which is derived from the: (a) Measuring implications of the triangle's widest point added to the breakout zone. (b) 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the preceding corrective leg from the swing high of ₹804 down to the recent swing low of ₹419, thereby lending additional credence to this resistance target.The stock after the last 2 months corrective decline is witnessing buying demand from the 200 days EMA thus offers fresh entry opportunity with a favorable risk-reward set up.We expect the stock to head higher towards 4870 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the last 2 months decline (5165-4401).The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus supporting the positive bias in the stock.","Bajaj Broking Research says JSW Energy, and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) are the top stock picks for today.

'INTEL CEO is highly CONFLICTED': Chipmaker's shares plunge over 3% after Donald Trump calls for Lip-Bu Tan's resignation; alleges ties to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ceo-of-intel-is-highly-conflicted-chipmakers-shares-plunge-over-3-after-donald-trump-calls-for-lip-bu-tans-resignation-alleges-ties-to-china/articleshow/123170719.cms,"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



Shares of Intel tumbled down on Thursday after US President Donald Trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to China.The INTC was trading at $19.77, down 0.6 points or 3.1% at 10:53 PM IST.“The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.“There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” he further added.Trump’s remarks came shortly after senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel chairman Frank Yeary, raising concerns over CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s business connections.The letter questioned whether Tan had divested his interests in various semiconductor firms that reportedly have links to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military.“In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO,” Cotton wrote in the letter.“Mr Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”The senator specifically highlighted Tan’s recent leadership at Cadence Design Systems, a tech company that had earlier admitted to selling products to China’s National University of Defense Technology in violation of US export rules.“US companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations,” Cotton posted on X.Intel is among the major beneficiaries of President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, having secured over $8 billion in federal funding to support the construction of chip plants across the United States.The company has yet to issue a response to either Trump’s post or Cotton’s letter.Following the controversy, Intel’s stock fell by 3%, even as broader markets, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq, moved higher.Founded in 1968 during the early days of the personal computing era, Intel has struggled in recent years. It failed to keep pace with the mobile revolution sparked by Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and has since fallen behind more agile competitors. The rise of artificial intelligence has only widened that gap, with Nvidia emerging as a dominant force in the chipmaking industry.Now under Tan’s leadership since March, Intel is undergoing major restructuring. The company is cutting thousands of jobs, slashing expenses, and even scaling back some domestic semiconductor manufacturing, all in an effort to turn around its declining fortunes.","US President Donald Trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to China.

The Parliamentary panel had suggested 285 recommendations on the draft legislation, aimed at simplifying and modernising the country's tax laws.The IT Bill 2025 was tabled in Parliament on Feb 13 and was aimed at simplifying the language and structure of the Income Tax Act 1961.It was sent to the Select Committee for examination. The bill will replace the six decade old Income Tax Act 1961.The simplification exercise was guided by three core principles, which included textual and structural simplification for improved clarity and coherence, no major tax policy changes to ensure continuity and certainty and no modification of tax rates, which is aimed at preserving predictability for taxpayers, an official statement had said.CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal in an interview to TOI last month had said that the provisions of law will become far more simpler for any taxpayer to read and understand. He had said the dependence on a professional to understand the law is expected to see some correction. ""The use of formulae, tables and consolidation of provisions will enable easier compliance for taxpayers and professionals,"" Agrawal had added.","The new bill was approved by the cabinet on Friday as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman withdrew earlier version of I-T bill 2025. The revised bill could have been introduced in Parliament on Friday itself, but it could not be done as disruptions forced the House to be adjourned by the time presidential assent was received.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123197323,imgsize-1179749,width-400,resizemode-4/123197323.jpg"
'Treat independent directors as stewards of accountability',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/treat-independent-directors-as-stewards-of-accountability/articleshow/123197107.cms,"NEW DELHI: There is a need to redefine the role of independent directors, and company boards must treat them as ""stewards of accountability"" and not as honorary appointees, Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Friday. He called on boards to equip themselves to meet the challenges of the future.""They must be viewed and treated as stewards of accountability,"" Pandey said in his address at the Institute of Directors' 35th Annual Directors Conclave in national capital. He highlighted three changes that are required, which include the selection of independent directors, orientation, and psychological safety.On the issue of selection, the Sebi chief urged companies to move beyond familiar networks and known circles and draw from diverse experiences, different sectors, younger professionals, and regional voices. He said many directors are highly qualified but unfamiliar with emerging AI governance, cyber threats, or ESG disclosures. He asserted that orientation should be ongoing and not just a one-time induction.Pandey said the most important change was psychological safety, and independent directors must feel free to dissent and question if the information is not robust. ""Because a board that never disagrees is not aligned, it's asleep.Divergent views, when rooted in purpose and mutual respect, strengthen the board. They test assumptions, lead to deeper discussions, and constructive decision-making,"" said the Sebi chairman.Apart from redefining the role of independent directors, Pandey also highlighted other shifts that are required for company boards to meet future challenges. He identified moving from compliance to culture, embracing technology for smarter governance, diversity beyond demographics, and reimagining the board of the future.""Now, let's take a moment and reimagine the boardroom of the future. It's not a ceremonial forum, but a learning organisation,"" said Pandey. ""It doesn't just protect company value; it creates long-term stakeholder trust. It doesn't avoid the uncomfortable questions; it insists on them to open up the blind spots, and it understands that its duty is not just to the promoter or the quarterly target but to the integrity of the institution,"" said the Sebi chief.","There is a need to redefine the role of independent directors, says Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey.

MUMBAI: At the heart of India's non-leather footwear manufacturing hub in Tamil Nadu where global brands such as Nike, Puma, Crocs and Adidas are pouring in several thousand crores of investments, there is worry over the looming US tariff threat of 50%.Brands are looking to reroute some of their orders to the US through other Asian hubs and players including American firms Crocs and Nike may be putting a pause on new export orders to the US from India until there is further clarity on trade talks between the two countries, sources indicated.A 25% tariff has already eroded India's export competitiveness compared to other regions such as Vietnam and Indonesia and another 25% would altogether bring business activity to a halt, fear exporters.

Sources familiar with the matter said that Walmart has not paused or cancelled orders as of now.Brands are certainly not reviewing their India growth plans or the idea to remain invested in the country; not now at least. Most of them are on a wait and watch mode and will take decisions based on how the deal talks between India and US pan out later this month. ""Companies will wait until there is clarity. But if the 50% tariff indeed gets applied, most of the orders to the US from India will stop getting shipped from that day,"" said Simon Lee, vice-president at the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce in India.

A sia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani has once again chosen to draw no salary from Reliance Industries, the oil-to-telecom-to-retail giant he heads, for the fifth consecutive year. Instead, dividend payouts remain his primary source of income, according to a PTI report.According to the latest annual report of Reliance Industries, Ambani, 68, received 'nil' salary, allowances, perquisites, and retiral benefits for the financial year 2024-25 (FY25).Ambani had capped his annual remuneration at Rs 15 crore between from financial year 2009 to 2020.Since FY21, he voluntarily opted to forego his salary due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has continued to do so each year since.Despite not drawing a salary, Ambani, who is currently the 18th richest person in the world with a net worth just under $100 billion, earned Rs 8.85 crore in dividend income from the 1.61 crore shares he directly holds in Reliance. This is based on the Rs 5.50 per share dividend declared by the company for FY25, as reported by PTI.In addition, promoter group firms under Ambani’s control hold 664.5 crore shares, amounting to a 50.07% stake in the company bringing in a combined dividend income of Rs 3,655 crore.The annual report also shed light on the remuneration of other top executives and family members. Ambani’s cousins, Nikhil and Hital Meswani, saw a slight dip in their pay to Rs 25 crore each in FY25, compared to Rs 25.31 crore and Rs 25.42 crore, respectively, in FY24. Their earnings included a commission of Rs 17.28 crore each, unchanged from the past three years, the PTI report said.Executive Director P M S Prasad’s remuneration rose to Rs 19.96 crore in FY25 from Rs 17.93 crore in the previous year. His pay includes performance-linked incentives for FY24, which were disbursed in FY25.Ambani’s three children, Isha, Akash, and Anant, who joined the Reliance board in October 2023 at nil salary, received Rs 6 lakh each as sitting fee and Rs 2.27 lakh each as commission, the PTI report said. In the previous financial year, they had received Rs 4 lakh in sitting fees and Rs 97 lakh in commission.The youngest, Anant Ambani, has since been appointed as an Executive Director on the Reliance board. From this fiscal year, he is expected to earn between Rs 10 crore and Rs 20 crore in salary, the report said.Other notable non-executive directors on the Reliance board include Raminder Singh Gujral, Shumeet Banerji, former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, former CVC K V Chowdary, veteran banker K V Kamath, and Saudi sovereign wealth fund nominee Yasir Othman H Al Rumayyan.

While the current year’s forecast has improved from a -0.2% contraction predicted in April, it remains well below pre-tariff expectations, PTI reported.“World merchandise trade is now projected to grow 0.9% in 2025, up from the -0.2% contraction forecasted in April but down from the 2.7% estimate pre-dating the tariff increases,” the WTO said.The slight upward revision for 2025 is driven by frontloading of imports in the US ahead of the tariff implementation deadlines, the WTO noted. However, it cautioned that persistent uncertainty continues to undermine global trade momentum.WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the shadow of tariff threats is weighing heavily on business sentiment and supply chains. “Uncertainty remains one of the most disruptive forces in the global trading environment,” she said.The trade body highlighted that Asian economies will remain the largest contributors to global merchandise trade growth in 2025. However, their role is expected to decline in 2026.

The sharp rise follows fresh duties that took effect Thursday, as part of President Donald Trump's continued push for “reciprocal” trade terms.At the time of Trump’s inauguration in January 2025, the US average tariff rate stood at just 2.4%. But a series of aggressive increases — especially targeting Chinese goods — has rapidly rolled back decades of trade liberalisation, AFP reported.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, who has spearheaded the aggressive tariff push since returning to office, took to Truth Social to defend the measures amid concerns that courts may move to block them.“Tariffs are having a huge positive impact on the Stock Market. Almost every day, new records are set. In addition, Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are pouring into our Country’s coffers,” Trump wrote.“If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date, in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money, wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. has ever seen, it would be impossible to ever recover, or pay back, these massive sums of money and honor,” he added.Trump further warned that a judicial reversal could provoke economic collapse “It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION! If they were going to rule against the wealth, strength, and power of America, they should have done so LONG AGO, at the beginning of the case, where our entire Country, while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again, would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy.”A brief spike in May had pushed the average to 24.8%, the highest since 1904, based on data from the United States International Trade Commission (USITC). That level temporarily dropped after a short-lived “truce” with China, but tariff escalations have since resumed.The latest WTO-IMF figure applies current US tariffs to 2024 trade volumes, factoring in recent agreements with key trading partners such as the EU, Japan, and South Korea. While those deals slightly softened the hikes threatened in April, they still locked in rates well above the previous norm — exceeding even the 1930s Smoot-Hawley era, when protectionism deepened the Great Depression.Trump’s April 2 declaration of sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs — aimed at narrowing America’s trade deficit — has led to retaliatory measures from several nations, further straining the global trade environment.The temporary China–US truce that reduced tariff levels is set to expire next week, raising the prospect of renewed escalation.","The average US tariff rate has climbed to 20.1%, its highest sustained level since the 1910s, according to new estimates.

Former Singapore foreign minister George Yeo has delivered a sharp rebuke of US President Donald Trump ’s trade policies, warning that his sweeping tariffs signal a decisive break from decades of free trade and could unleash severe disruption across global supply chains.Speaking to First Voice, as reported by The Raisina Hills, Yeo said Trump was “going back to an old world” where there was “no WTO, no MFN,” and trade became an instrument of political leverage.“I like you, I need you more, so we have one regime. I don’t like you, you need me more, we have another regime,” he said, describing Trump’s trade strategy.Yeo argued that this shift reflects a decline in US confidence compared to the era when it commanded 40% of the global economy and set the rules under the World Trade Organisation “The US no longer feels the same self-confidence… it feels a growing insecurity about itself,” he added.He likened the unpredictability of Trump’s trade moves to a ship carrying 20,000 containers mid-voyage that suddenly faces new US rules. “What do you do? If you are receiving those containers, maybe you don’t want them. Or maybe you want the ship to speed up so it arrives before the new policies are in place,” Yeo said, warning that Trump “doesn’t understand that you can change your mind from day to day, but it’s a long tail” for trade flows.Despite his concerns, Yeo said trade “is like water — it will always find its way” regardless of the rules imposed.His remarks come as Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs took effect just after midnight on Thursday, hitting exports from more than 60 countries and the European Union with higher import duties.

Trump Tariff Shocker: Amazon, Walmart Freeze Indian Orders, US Packaging Firms Brace for Cost Shock



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



A sweeping executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on Thursday has paved the way for 401(k) accounts to include private equity, cryptocurrency , and other alternative assets as retirement saving option.A 401(k) is a tax-advantaged retirement savings plan where employees can defer part of their salary, often with employer contributions, and invest the funds for growth, with taxes generally paid upon withdrawal in retirement.The order directs the Labor Department and other federal agencies to revise the definition of “qualified assets” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which governs retirement plans. Once implemented, employers could offer workers a broader menu of investment choices, including private equity funds, bitcoin, and real estate. The rulemaking process could take several months.Currently, most 401(k) portfolios are concentrated in stocks, bonds, cash, and widely traded commodities like gold. Alternative assets have been largely off-limits due to concerns over volatility, high fees, and limited liquidity.The change is a win for the $5 trillion private equity sector and the cryptocurrency industry- both of which backed Trump’s 2024 campaign and have long sought ERISA access. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has repeatedly called for private equity inclusion in retirement plans, while Coinbase has lobbied for broader public adoption of crypto.Bitcoin prices rose two per cent to $116,542 on Thursday, nearly doubling since Trump’s election, as reported by AP. Crypto executives argue the asset offers long-term upside, particularly for younger, tech-savvy workers. “It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)s,” said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin.Private equity has averaged 13 per cent annual returns since 1990, compared to 10.6 per cent for the S&P 500, including dividends, according to Cambridge Associates. However, such investments typically require long-term commitments and carry higher costs.Also read: Donald Trump's Genius Act- Major crypto bill for stablecoins passed in US; here is what to know Industry groups welcomed Trump’s move but urged caution. “We look forward to working with the Trump Administration on a thoughtful framework that expands access to alternatives for retirement savers with appropriate investor guardrails,” said Bryan Corbett, CEO of the Managed Funds Association.Major retirement providers like Fidelity, Vanguard, and T. Rowe Price will need to develop suitable products, and adoption could take years. Vanguard, in a statement, said it is committed to educating retirement investors on the risks and opportunities of private assets but has not yet pledged to launch such a product.The Biden administration had previously advised treating crypto investments with “extreme care” given their volatility. Trump’s move marks a sharp policy shift — one that could channel billions in retirement savings into high-growth, high-risk markets.","A sweeping executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on Thursday has paved the way for 401(k) accounts to include private equity, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets.

US president Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he will nominate top economic adviser Stephen Miran to temporarily fill a vacancy on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.Miran, who currently chairs the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, is set to replace outgoing governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee stepping down on Friday. If confirmed by the senate, Miran will serve through January 31, 2026, reports AP.“It is my Great Honor to announce that I have chosen Dr. Stephen Miran, current Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve in the just vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board until January 31, 2026. In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement. Stephen has a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University, and served with distinction in my First Administration. He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job. Congratulations Stephen!” Trump said through a post on Truth Social.The nomination of Stephen Miran could raise fresh concerns about political pressure on the Federal Reserve, an institution long valued for its independence from day-to-day politics. That independence is considered essential for making tough decisions, such as raising interest rates to control inflation, reports AP.As a Fed governor, Miran would have a vote on all interest-rate decisions and regulatory policies, and his appointment is expected to tilt the balance in favor of lowering interest rates. This is in contrast with the outgoing governor, Adriana Kugler, who aligned with Jerome Powell to advocate for holding rates steady while assessing the economic impact of tariffs.Trump has previously called on Federal Reserve policymakers, including Chair Jerome Powell, the six other Board members, and the 12 regional Fed bank presidents, to lower interest rates, reports Reuters.The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.3 percent in a recent meeting, maintaining the level set after three rate cuts late last year. However, two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both appointed during Trump’s first term, dissented from the decision.""I look forward to quickly considering his nomination in the Senate Banking Committee and hearing more about his plans to increase transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve to ensure the agency prioritizes its mandate and avoids politics,"" said Tim Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman.The Senate is not scheduled to return until September 2, at which time lawmakers will also face the urgent task of passing a government funding bill to avoid a partial shutdown at the end of the month, reports Reuters.Trump is also reportedly considering potential candidates to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term concludes on May 15, 2026.“Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW.

Monetary policy: Bank of England trims rate to 4%; signals cautious easing ahead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/monetary-policy-bank-of-england-trims-rate-to-4-signals-cautious-easing-ahead/articleshow/123172248.cms,"Bank of England (Picture credit: AP)

The Bank of England on Thursday trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4 per cent, marking the fifth reduction since August 2024, as it seeks to support Britain’s slowing economy amid concerns over rising US tariffs and domestic tax hikes.The latest cut brings borrowing costs to their lowest level since March 2023, with Governor Andrew Bailey cautioning, “Interest rates are still on a downward path, but any future rate cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.” The move came despite inflation rising to an 18-month high of 3.6 per cent in June, well above the BoE’s 2 per cent target, driven by persistent fuel and food prices.As per news agency AFP, the BoE now expects inflation to peak at 4 per cent next month, before easing back to target by the second quarter of 2027. The central bank also raised its growth forecast slightly, expecting the UK economy to expand by 1.25 per cent this year, up from the earlier 1 per cent estimate.While the direct impact of US tariffs is “milder than feared,” the central bank noted that broader uncertainty linked to tariff policies continues to dampen business sentiment.In May, the UK and the US agreed to lower tariffs, previously set above 10 per cent, on select British exports, including cars.However, baseline tariffs of 10 per cent on most UK goods introduced by US President Donald Trump in April remain in place.The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee faced an unprecedented situation during its deliberations. Initially split in a three-way vote, four members backed the cut, four favoured no change, and one called for a deeper 0.5 per cent cut, the decision passed only after a second round of voting, a first since the bank gained independence in 1997.The UK economy contracted for a second consecutive month in May, and unemployment has climbed to 4.7 per cent, its highest since 2021.As per AFP, analysts, including those at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, believe the Labour government’s decision to raise business taxes in April has also weighed heavily on business activity.“There are slightly more risks on the downside to activity,” said Bailey after the rate cut, as per AFP. “Economic growth is subdued, the labour market continues to loosen and consumption growth may take longer to pick up.”Treasury chief Rachel Reeves welcomed the BoE’s move, saying it would help reduce costs for “mortgages and loans for families and businesses.” She added that the government remained focused on boosting long-term growth through infrastructure investment and trade partnerships.Expectations that rates will remain steady at 4 per cent for longer have lent support to the pound, even as some traders remain cautious ahead of the Autumn Budget.","The Bank of England on Thursday trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4 per cent.

Foreign investors returned to Asian equities in July for the third month in a row, with Taiwan attracting its biggest inflow in nearly two decades and Thailand breaking a nine-month streak of outflows. The upbeat momentum was fuelled by growing interest in artificial intelligence, improved trade ties with the United States, and easing tariff concerns.Investment flows into most Asian markets have stabilised over the past three months as governments across the region secured more favourable trade deals with Washington, reducing volatility and uncertainty that had rattled financial markets.Taiwan and South Korea emerged as top picks for overseas investors in July. According to LSEG data, Taiwan drew $7.78 billion in foreign funds, the highest monthly inflow since the 2008 global financial crisis, while South Korea saw $4.52 billion, its strongest since February 2024.The MSCI index tracking Asian equities excluding Japan rose 2% last month, marking its fifth straight month of gains. Stock benchmarks in Taipei and Seoul both climbed around 6%.Over the past three months, Taiwan and South Korea, both major tech exporters, have collectively attracted $25.7 billion, riding a wave of global investments into AI-related industries, Reuters reported.In South Korea, investor confidence was further supported by shareholder-friendly reforms, political stability, and strong corporate performance. However, fresh concerns around potential tax policy changes are beginning to raise caution among market participants.Thailand, meanwhile, saw foreign investors return after a prolonged exit, with net inflows of $499 million in July, the first since September last year. Bargain-hunting helped drive demand after months of heavy selling.Even so, the Thai market continues to face headwinds. Political uncertainty, weak macroeconomic indicators, and a strong currency that weighs on export competitiveness are dampening investor appetite for the longer term.Thailand's benchmark SET index surged 14% in July, its best performance since November 2020. But the rebound wasn't enough to offset earlier losses — the index is still down 10% this year, making it one of the region's worst performers.""We are cautious and underweight on Thailand as it remains in a fairly precarious position: high household debt, limited government spending, an uncertain political environment, and external negative events such as the conflict with Cambodia,"" said Kenneth Tang, senior portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management.""If Thailand can settle these issues, it will clear up the path for its recovery,"" Reuters cited Tang.Elsewhere in Asia, India witnessed sharp foreign outflows of over $2 billion in July, its largest monthly sell-off since February, ending a three-month streak of net buying. Indonesia and the Philippines also saw outflows of $570 million and $29 million, respectively.Vietnam, on the other hand, attracted $326 million in foreign funds in July, with investors encouraged by the country's strong growth outlook and a favourable tariff arrangement recently secured with the United States.","Taiwan drew $7.78 billion in foreign funds, the highest monthly inflow since the 2008 global financial crisis.

Low-income Americans are pulling back on spending, often saying no to eating out, traveling, and even cutting back on basics like diapers, fizzy drinks, and beer, as import duties continue to push prices higher.In response, many fast-food chains are now offering cheaper, smaller meal bundles to keep demand steady.Researchers at Yale’s Budget Lab and the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity say the brunt of these price increases is likely to fall on the poorest Americans, as importers pass on the costs to consumers.According to recent earnings reports and executive commentary cited by Reuters, consumers are increasingly turning to bargains.Industry experts have warned that companies may need to cut into profits, as relying on price hikes to boost revenue is becoming unsustainable.Executives from Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and Chipotle Mexican Grill say consumers are becoming more bargain-conscious as inflation persists and recent tariff hikes under US President Donald Trump begin to affect everyday goods.“It does feel like there are certain cohorts of the consumer, definitely on the lower-income side, that are feeling pressure right now,” Chipotle’s Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer told Reuters.Procter & Gamble noted that Trump’s tariffs have already raised the cost of some of its products.Definitions of “low income” vary by location and family size. Bank of America, the country’s second-largest consumer-facing bank, classifies those earning $50,000 or less as “lower income” and more likely to live paycheck to paycheck.Chipotle uses a slightly higher threshold of $75,000, while Coca-Cola considers households earning under $40,000 as low-income.Chipotle said it would keep the financial strain on its lower-income customers in mind when considering future price increases.Seen as a bellwether for consumer products, P&G offered a cautious outlook for its fiscal year, citing multiple pressures on consumer spending: Trump’s tariffs, immigration crackdowns, high interest rates, and sustained inflation.Coca-Cola is responding by promoting more affordable options for budget-conscious shoppers, according to CEO James Quincey.Molson Coors also reported a shift in consumer behavior, with more buyers seeking smaller, cheaper pack sizes.With the cost of essentials like Hershey’s chocolate and Tide detergent rising, and cuts to federal food aid programs looming, many households are feeling the squeeze. Pandemic-era savings have largely been depleted.“Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical, as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski.He noted a double-digit decline in fast-food visits from lower-income earners compared to last year, adding that weaker jobs growth in July has made them even more cautious.Analysts are observing the same caution during major seasonal shopping events, including back-to-school sales. Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group pointed to diminished enthusiasm among budget-conscious households.Bank of America data shows that credit card spending by low-income consumers dropped in the three months to June compared to the previous year, even as spending among middle- and higher-income groups rose. While a strong labor market has provided some cushion, analysts and executives warn that pressure is mounting, Reuters reported.Fast-food chains are now scrambling to offer better deals. While $5 bundles are being promoted, households are still hunting for deeper discounts. McDonald’s said its reintroduced $2.99 snack wrap has shown “encouraging” results.Taco Bell’s $1 to $3 menu items — including sodas and burritos, have helped sustain demand. However, Yum Brands, which owns Pizza Hut and KFC, reported weaker sales for their higher-priced pizzas and chicken buckets.Kraft Heinz has said it does not expect consumer sentiment to improve this year and is rolling out larger, value-focused pack sizes to ease pressure on shoppers.“We also have a consumer who, unlike a few years ago when inflation was peaking, doesn’t have savings built up in the same way they did in 2022 and 2023,” said Katherine Cullen, Vice President of Industry and Consumer Insights at the National Retail Federation (NRF).“We see that particularly among lower-income consumers.”As the economic fallout from the tariffs continues, it’s clear that US consumers — particularly the most vulnerable — are being forced to make difficult choices about where and how they spend.","Low-income Americans are pulling back on spending, often saying no to eating out, traveling, and even cutting back on basics like diapers, fizzy drinks, and beer.

New data for jobless benefits shows that the number of American citizens filing for unemployment benefits rose modestly last week, showing that employers are still retaining workers despite looming uncertainty on the US trade policy.The number of Americans filing for jobless support rose by 7,000 last week to 226,000, according to figures released by the US department of labor on Thursday. That’s slightly higher than the 219,000 new applications economists had expected for the week ending 2 August.The report marks the first official government snapshot of the job market since last Friday’s bleak July jobs report triggered a sharp sell-off on Wall Street, and a stunning political reaction. Donald Trump, furious over the weak numbers, ordered the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which compiles the monthly jobs data.Weekly jobless claims are widely viewed as a gauge of layoffs across the country. Despite the uptick, claims have largely remained within the historically low range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the COVID-19 crisis slammed the economy in early 2020.This is only the second increase in jobless applications over the past eight weeks.Still, recent trends point to a cooling labour market.Last week’s monthly jobs report showed US employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, well below the 115,000 forecast. To make matters worse, revised estimates slashed 258,000 jobs from the May and June totals, and the unemployment rate edged up to 4.2% from 4.1%.Many economists believe President Trump’s unpredictable tariff measures, rolled out in April, have unsettled employers and made them hesitant to hire. The latest tariffs, steep taxes on imported goods, took effect on Thursday.While some trade deals have been reached and a few deadlines extended, uncertainty remains high. Economists warn the tariffs could drag on the economy and fuel another round of inflation.Major corporations have been trimming staff this year. Procter & Gamble, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Google and Facebook parent Meta have all announced layoffs. Most recently, both Intel and The Walt Disney Co confirmed job cuts.Thursday’s data also showed the four-week moving average of jobless claims dipped slightly by 500 to 220,750, offering a more stable view of the underlying trend.Meanwhile, the number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending 26 July jumped by 38,000 to 1.97 million, the highest figure since November 2021.","The number of Americans filing for jobless support rose by 7,000 last week to 226,000.

South Korea narrowly avoided steep US tariffs on Thursday after sealing a high-stakes trade deal with Washington, capping new import duties at 15 per cent, instead of the 25 per cent originally set to take effect from Friday.As reported by The Korea Herald, in exchange, Seoul pledged a USD 350 billion investment package along with USD 100 bn energy imports from US and most favoured nation status to US, in key sectors which helped in reinforcing cap on tariffs.The agreement, reached just hours before the deadline, suspends the near-zero tariff regime under the 2012 Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and introduces a new ""reciprocal"" rate similar to deals recently struck with Japan and the European Union. The deal comes at a critical time, with the U.S. taking in nearly a fifth of Korea's total exports reports Korea Herald.The newly installed government in Seoul moved quickly to craft a deal acceptable to Washington, negotiating up from an initial USD 100 billion offer before agreeing to the final USD 350 billion package, below Japan's USD 550 billion commitment to the US.President Lee Jae Myung called the outcome a ""major breakthrough,"" crediting it with restoring predictability for Korean exporters.""This agreement aligns America's goal of manufacturing revival with Korea's ambition to expand its industrial competitiveness in the US market,"" Lee said in a Facebook post. ""It will further deepen Korea-US industrial cooperation and strengthen our alliance.""Of the Korean investment, USD 150 billion will fund a major shipbuilding initiative named ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again."" Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol said the program was ""the single most decisive factor"" in finalizing the deal. ""With Korean shipbuilders recognized for world-class design and construction capabilities, the project is expected to unlock new growth momentum and position Korea as a core partner in reviving US industry,"" he said.Another USD 200 billion will support joint industrial efforts in strategic sectors like semiconductors, nuclear energy, batteries, and biopharma. To reduce risk, the U.S. agreed to take over output from vetted projects, according to presidential policy chief Kim Yong-beom.Korea also committed to buying USD 100 billion in U.S. LNG and energy products over four years and secured most-favored-nation treatment for future tariff considerations on key exports.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

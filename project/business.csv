Gold prices, which touched fresh record highs in India last week, may face a crucial test in the coming days as global macroeconomic cues and Federal Reserve signals drive investor sentiment, analysts said.The most-traded October contract on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) surged to an all-time high of Rs 1,04,090 per 10 grams on Friday before settling just below record levels. The rally was aided by a weaker rupee, which closed at an unprecedented 88.09 against the US dollar, down 51 paise, amid heavy foreign fund outflows and rising tensions over a trade deal with Washington, PTI reported.“In the week ahead, focus will be on the manufacturing and services PMI data across regions, and the US employment report. Festive demand in India and uncertainty over the Russia-Ukraine peace deal, as well as straining India-US relations, will also drive market sentiment,” said Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG — Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services.Mer noted that while some profit booking is likely, the broader trend remains supportive. “Gold prices may find support with an upside potential of Rs 1,08,000–1,10,000 per 10 grams in the short term,” he said.The rupee’s weakness is providing an additional lift to domestic bullion prices, said Aksha Kamboj, Vice President of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association. “In the domestic market, a weakening rupee is keeping gold elevated, with rates likely to stay above Rs 1 lakh per 10 grams,” she said.She also flagged the recent US appeals court ruling that declared President Donald Trump’s tariffs illegal, noting that any further developments on the issue will be closely tracked by traders.Globally, Comex gold futures for December delivery ended 1.2% higher at $3,530.70 per ounce in New York on Saturday, close to the historic peak of $3,534.10 reached on August 8. Prathamesh Mallya, DVP–Research, Non-Agri Commodities and Currencies at Angel One, said international bullion has rallied nearly 6.6% since August 20.However, analysts warned of near-term corrections after the steep climb. “In the week ahead, gold prices might see some correction as prices are at their highest levels in both international and domestic markets, while the dollar index is also near its crucial make-or-break point of 100,” Mallya said.Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent remarks highlighting labour market risks have fuelled expectations of a rate cut at the September 16–17 policy meeting, but political uncertainty has deepened after Trump’s public attempt to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook raised concerns about the central bank’s independence.Analysts expect heightened volatility in bullion. While the long-term outlook remains constructive on hopes of monetary easing and festive demand in India, traders may see sharp swings in the near term.","The most-traded October contract on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) surged to an all-time high of Rs 1,04,090 per 10 grams on Friday.

Stock market recommendations:In August, Nifty moved within a narrow band of 816 points — its tightest monthly range since March 2024 — despite elevated volatility. The index reflected a tug-of-war between supportive domestic developments and persistent global uncertainties. Sentiment saw a mid-month boost following S&P’s upgrade of India’s outlook and Prime Minister Modi’s announcement on GST reforms.However, this optimism proved short-lived. In the final stretch of the month, Nifty reversed sharply, losing over 700 points in just six trading sessions. The sell-off was primarily driven by rising tariff tensions between the US and India.Eventually, the index settled near the 24400 mark, registering a monthly decline of 1.38%. This marked the second straight month of negative returns, highlighting continued selling pressure and the lack of follow-through buying.From a technical standpoint, Nifty now trades below its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs — all of which are sloping downward, indicating weakening momentum in the short to medium term. Adding to the cautious outlook, the daily RSI has dropped below the 40 level and remains in a declining trend, which is a bearish signal.Looking ahead, the 200-day EMA zone of 24300–24250 has emerged as a critical support area. A sustained breach below 24250 could intensify the downside, potentially dragging the index toward the 24000 mark. On the flip side, the resistance zone of 24650–24700 will be key; only a decisive breakout above this range could revive bullish sentiment and open the door for a recovery.Bank Nifty witnessed a steep decline in August, falling nearly 4% and forming a large bearish candle on the monthly chart. This weakness comes on the heels of a Dark Cloud Cover candlestick pattern seen in July, which has now been confirmed by the August correction — reinforcing the bearish outlook on a broader timeframe.The index has been consistently lagging behind the frontline indices in recent weeks. This relative underperformance is clearly reflected in the Bank Nifty vs Nifty ratio chart, which has dropped to a 100-day low — a sign of sustained weakness. After hitting a swing high of 56156, the index has plunged over 2400 points in just nine trading sessions, underscoring the severity of the decline.This correction has dragged the index below its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs, all of which have started to slope downward — a bearish technical signal. The daily RSI remains in negative territory and continues to decline, while the MACD stays bearish, trading below both its signal line and the zero line.Looking ahead, the 200-day EMA zone of 53600–53500 has emerged as a key support area. A sustained move below 53500 could open the door for further downside toward 52900, followed by 52400 in the near term. On the upside, the resistance zone of 54500–54600 will be crucial; only a decisive breakout above this range could signal a potential recovery.The stock has registered a breakout from a falling channel pattern on Friday, ending a prolonged phase of consolidation that lasted 72 trading sessions. This breakout is particularly significant as it is accompanied by strong volume, lending credibility to the move and indicating renewed buying interest. In addition to the pattern breakout, the stock has also surged above its key short-term and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the bullish shift in trend.This crossover suggests that the stock may now be entering a new upward trajectory after weeks of range-bound movement.Notably, the daily RSI has climbed above the 60 mark for the first time since June 2025, signalling a momentum shift and strengthening the bullish case. This RSI breakout from a subdued zone further supports the possibility of sustained upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 700-690 level with a stoploss of Rs 670 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 750 in the short term.The stock formed a Shooting Star candlestick pattern on August 01, which triggered a subsequent correction. This pullback found support near the 50-day EMA, from where the stock has resumed its upward trajectory. Notably, it continues to outperform the broader market, as reflected in the ratio chart against the Nifty 500, which has already broken out of a consolidation phase on the daily timeframe.Currently, the stock is on the verge of a horizontal trendline breakout, further strengthening its bullish setup. Trading at an all-time high, all key moving averages and momentum indicators are aligned positively. The daily RSI has surged past the 60 mark and remains in an upward trend, reinforcing the strong bullish momentum.Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 755-750 level with a stoploss of Rs 720 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 820 in the short term.","According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, the top stock picks for this week are CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, and Syrma SGS Technology Ltd.

MUMBAI: Tariff-related developments, the strong GDP numbers for the June quarter of the year that govt announced on Friday and the ensuing meeting on GST rejig are expected to have a balancing effect on Dalal Street investors during the week. With foreign funds continuing to sell Indian stocks, the rupee could come under renewed pressure, market players said.Last week, the sensex lost nearly 1,500 points or nearly 2%. Most of the losses in the benchmark indices were in the last three sessions of the week, after the higher US tariffs kicked in on Aug 27, which was a trading holiday. On Friday, after the markets closed, the govt said that in Q1FY26 India's GDP had grown by 7.8%, compared to 7.4% the previous quarter, beating estimates of most economists and analysts. In the face of all US tariff-related uncertainties, this could be a market stabilising factor during the week, brokers said.Trading on the Street in the new week will also depend on foreign funds' trading behaviour. In Aug, FPIs had net sold Indian stocks worth nearly Rs 39,100 crore, taking the total for 2025 to close to Rs 1.71 crore. The FPI selloff has also weakened the rupee against most major currencies.","Last week, the sensex lost nearly 1,500 points or nearly 2%.

Elevator facelift: Metro train-like locks from December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/elevator-facelift-metro-train-like-locks-from-december/articleshow/123623922.cms,"



CHENNAI: Elevators that would hit the Indian market from Dec this year will have a new safety feature. The elevator car will get locked only after doors are closed akin to the doors of metro train compartments that shut and lock automatically.It is aimed at preventing the movement of elevator cars with open doors and avoiding accidents in lifts in the country, which is the second-largest market for elevators after China.The elevators will be equipped with speed governors. The Ascending Car Overspeed Protection (a safety system) will stop the upward overspeed in the event of control failure. These are part of the new lift code mandated by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) that all elevator manufacturers in the country must comply by Dec 22, 2025. The move will enhance the safety of elevators in states, where lift laws were absent. Currently, 17 states have an act and rules for installation and operation of elevators and escalators.The new IS 17900 Part 1 & 2 standards at par with the European standards (EN 81-20/50) will bring the Indian vertical transportation industry in line with the international benchmark norms. The key enhancements include introducing stringent requirements for structural integrity, door systems, emergency communication, and inclusive design. It mandates the use of advanced protective technologies such as light curtains and fail-safe door locking mechanisms, while also requiring elevators to be equipped with two-way communication systems that remain operational during power outages and fire safety and evacuation procedures. Moreover, the new standards also address the safety of elevator technicians, who are engaged in maintenance.","Elevators that would hit the Indian market from Dec this year will have a new safety feature.

Ban leaves online gaming employees in lurch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ban-leaves-online-gaming-employees-in-lurch/articleshow/123623881.cms,"



MUMBAI: Resumes of employees working with gaming firms have flooded the job market after a sudden ban on online money games have left scores of salaried people stranded with uncertainty. More than 2,000 professionals are currently on the lookout for opportunities, said Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD and CEO at staffing firm CIEL HR.After Parliament cleared the Online Gaming Bill last week, companies having real money gaming (RMG) businesses such as Dream11, Zupee and Gameskraft wound down RMG ops, taking a hit on their revenues.There haven't been wide-spread layoffs in the sector yet; firms are trying to pivot their models, diversify and expand to big overseas gaming markets, but the ban has impacted employee sentiment. The risks attached to the long-term viability of their current jobs have nudged them to seek more stable shores.""Cash-rich companies can easily pivot but the process takes time. There's a sense of uncertainty among employees,"" said Neelabh Shukla, chief business officer at Careernet. Gaming associations have pegged the number of direct and indirect jobs generated by the online skill gaming sector at over 2 lakh.Staffing firms estimate the count of direct jobs to be lower, at a few thousands.The challenge would be for people in non-tech and non-engineering roles, given that the broader job market for such roles is not very robust. For employees in tech domains, it's not much of a problem considering the high demand for tech-based jobs. Besides, as RMG companies pivot and test new models and businesses, tech talent would be required to build the structures. ""We see more people reaching out from non-tech and non-engineering domains because non-tech skills are not very fungible. In gaming, digital content and digital marketing are two big non-tech departments. For people working in these roles, it will be difficult to find next level avenues. They also may not find many jobs internally,"" said Shukla. Developers and specialists with niche skills will continue to command competitive salaries because their expertise is in demand.","More than 2,000 professionals are currently on the lookout for opportunities.

Bond markets make it tough for banks to pass on rate cuts to you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bond-markets-make-it-tough-for-banks-to-pass-on-rate-cuts-to-you/articleshow/123623852.cms,"



MUMBAI: Why have loan rates not dropped much even after RBI's cuts? Bond markets are partly responsible for the slow transmission. Bond yields are rising even as the central bank is cutting rates - this divergence is unusual.Why the rise in yields? Long term inflationary expectations, closing of an important liquidity channel for the banking industry (open market operations, or OMOs) by RBI, and expectations of marginal cut in rates have combined to keep the benchmark yield on 10-year govt bonds at an elevated level.This in turn has hurt the transmission of rate cuts to borrowers as banks and other lenders have not cut interest rates on loans as much as RBI and govt had expected they would. Hence, govt and RBI are worried that the rate cut transmission has stalled. Although the consumer inflation for July was at 1.6%, a multi-year low level, market players expect this to start rising soon.""Bond investors desire protection against inflation. While current inflation readings are low, expectations about future inflation remain elevated,"" said Sandeep Bagla, CEO, Trust Mutual Fund.On Aug 6, RBI said that consumer inflation for FY26 is projected at 3.1%, going up to 4.9% by the first quarter of FY27.""Ironically, reducing repo rates and increasing liquidity support growth in the short term, but can be seen to fuel inflation in the long term. Globally, bond yields are going up despite central bankers cutting short term rates. Bond markets are telling us that they expect inflation to go up and remain elevated in the medium to long term,"" Bagla said.Despite RBI's cut in policy rates by 100 basis points (equal to one percentage point) since Feb this year, the yield on 10-year gilts has risen. From 6.23% on June 6, the last time the central bank cut policy rate (by 50bps to 5.5%), bond investors have been bearish on govt securities. As a result, the benchmark yield on Friday closed at 6.59%. Bond yields and prices of these instruments move in opposite directions. Rise in bond yields while the central bank is cutting rates is unusual.A report by Axis Mutual Fund's fixed income head Devang Shah, termed this phenomenon of rising benchmark yields despite cut in rates, supportive macroeconomic scenario, and improved sovereign ratings, as a ""notable dislocation"". ""This divergence stems from structural imbalances, evolving fiscal expectations, and shifting regulatory dynamics,"" Shah said.A section of the bond market players is also worried about the expected revenue losses for the central and state govts from the ensuing cut in GST rates. The question for them is if the govts will go for higher borrowing to make up for the revenue loss.","Bond yields are rising even as the central bank is cutting rates - this divergence is unusual.

Date determination based on lunar observations





Significance of the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal





Who was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?





Public holiday outlook in the UAE









This year, the Islamic calendar places the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on Friday, September 5, 2025. Based on lunar observations and official announcements, the date could coincide with a long weekend in the UAE, marking a time of spiritual reflection and public observance. Here's a detailed look at how the holiday is determined and why it matters.The Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle, and significant dates—such as religious holidays—are determined by the sighting of the new moon. On Saturday, August 23, 2025, the International Astronomy Center in the UAE confirmed that the crescent moon marking the beginning of Rabi Al Awwal, the third month of the Islamic calendar, was not sighted anywhere across the Arab world.This absence of moon sighting means the start of the month differs by region. Some countries began Rabi Al Awwal on Sunday, while others started it on Monday. In Oman, for instance, the new lunar month started later, which pushed the 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal—the date of Prophet Muhammad's birth anniversary—to Friday, September 5, 2025.Although the UAE government has not yet issued an official holiday announcement, the alignment of this date with the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) has led to speculation that UAE residents may receive a three-day public holiday—Friday through Sunday.The 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal holds profound importance in the Islamic world as it commemorates the birth of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). This day is not only a religious observance but also a moment for Muslims to reflect on the Prophet's life, teachings, and legacy.In many Islamic countries, the day is marked by prayers, religious lectures, and community gatherings. While cultural and traditional expressions of this day vary, the central focus remains on honouring the Prophet’s character, compassion, and leadership.Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the founder of Islam and the final messenger in the line of prophets that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He received and conveyed the Qurʾān, the holy book of Islam, and his teachings form the core of Islamic belief and practice.He was born in Mecca (in present-day Saudi Arabia) around the year 570 CE, known as the Year of the Elephant. His life is recognized not only for its religious significance but also for his role as a spiritual guide and political leader, who transformed Arabian society through principles of justice, mercy, and unity.The Prophet passed away on June 8, 632 CE, in Medina, at approximately 62 years of age. His legacy continues to influence over a billion Muslims around the world.While the UAE’s official public holiday calendar has not confirmed the Prophet’s Birthday holiday yet, the alignment of the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal with Friday, September 5, makes it likely that residents could enjoy an extended weekend. If declared, this would be a three-day break, from Friday to Sunday.Public holidays in the UAE for Islamic events are typically aligned with moon sightings, and dates can vary until officially confirmed. However, based on current astronomical projections and regional observances, the date is becoming increasingly clear.","The Islamic calendar places the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on Friday, September 5, 2025.

Billion-dollar paper wealth

Trump sons, Nasdaq bell and investor bets

Regulators and red flags

Trump’s wider crypto empire

Alt5’s chequered past





The Trump family’s latest foray into cryptocurrency has triggered questions over conflict of interest after a $750 million transaction put their businesses on both sides of the deal, The Wall Street Journal reported.According to the WSJ, the arrangement centres on World Liberty Financial (WLFI) — the Trump family’s flagship crypto venture launched last year. Earlier this month, WLFI took over Alt5 Sigma, a publicly listed payments firm that evolved from a pain-treatment business. Alt5 then raised $750 million from outside investors and used the funds to buy WLFI’s newly created cryptocurrency.That structure, the Journal said, will deliver the Trump family a windfall of about $500 million, since an entity it controls retains up to three-quarters of revenues from WLFI sales.Such “circular” transactions — with the same party effectively acting as both buyer and seller — are common in crypto markets but rare in traditional finance, and often raise red flags. Half a dozen former financial-market regulators told WSJ the deal could expose investors to risks, though it likely complies with US securities laws as long as disclosures are made.Public filings reviewed by WSJ show that President Donald Trump personally holds two-thirds of the WLFI tokens, with the family’s total stake valued at more than $6 billion on paper.Crypto has now overtaken real estate as the Trump family’s dominant business interest, overshadowing the former president’s half-century property empire.The WLFI token — described by the family as the crypto equivalent of an IPO — is set to debut trading on Monday. While some enthusiasts expect its value to soar, earlier Trump-linked tokens surged before collapsing, WSJ noted.The family could, in theory, earn billions more from the eventual public sale of WLFI’s 33 billion tokens, on top of those held directly. However, cashing out remains challenging: “even a small amount of selling can trigger prices to drop,” the report cautioned.Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump celebrated the deal alongside WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff by ringing the Nasdaq opening bell in New York earlier this month. Warren Hui of Soul Ventures, one of the investors in Alt5’s fundraising, told WSJ: “They are launching their product at the right time with the right team.”Among backers in the $750 million raise were Point72 Asset Management, run by billionaire Steve Cohen, and Hong Kong-based Soul Ventures. Alt5 itself, valued at about $1 billion, has said it will accumulate WLFI under a “treasury strategy” modelled after MicroStrategy’s bitcoin purchases.Unlike MicroStrategy, however, Alt5 is buying tokens directly from WLFI — a related party that also controls supply. Alt5 paid 20 cents per WLFI token, a 50% premium to the price in a recent private sale, boosting the overall valuation.Howard Fischer, former senior trial counsel at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), told WSJ: “We are in strange and uncharted territory in the securities world. People are making investment decisions that they wouldn’t make in other times.”Corey Frayer, a former SEC official who oversaw crypto policy, warned that the deal “brings the worst practices of the crypto ecosystem into regulated public markets.”While spokespeople for WLFI and Alt5 did not respond to WSJ’s requests for comment, the White House pushed back at criticism. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”Beyond WLFI, the family holds several billion dollars in $Trump memecoin and in Trump Media, the parent of Truth Social, which also invests in cryptocurrencies. WLFI separately runs a dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, and plans a crypto payments app.Launched last September with the slogan “Make America Great Again, this time with crypto,” WLFI had already raised $650 million privately, including funds from Chinese crypto billionaire Justin Sun, WSJ reported.Investors like Morten Christensen, founder of crypto site AirdropAlert, told the Journal they expect WLFI’s value to surge: “It ticks all the boxes for a token to go up violently,” he said, adding he hopes the president will tweet in support after trading begins.Until 2023, Alt5 operated as JanOne, a recycling and pain-medication company that settled SEC fraud allegations by paying a fine without admitting or denying charges. After buying a small crypto payments firm, it rebranded as Alt5 Sigma and pivoted into digital assets.WLFI paid for its stake in Alt5 using its own WLFI tokens, valued at $750 million. The deal also gave Eric Trump a board seat at Alt5 and installed Witkoff as chairman.As part of its strategy, WLFI has even indicated it will use profits from its USD1 stablecoin to buy back WLFI — a move a developer described on X as creating “permanent buying pressure.”","World Liberty Financial (WLFI) took over Alt5 Sigma, a publicly listed payments firm that evolved from a pain-treatment business. Alt5 then raised $750 million from outside investors and used the funds to buy WLFI’s newly created cryptocurrency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123616952,imgsize-1028485,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

US President Donald Trump marked Labor Day weekend by spotlighting what the White House described as “nearly $10 trillion” in new investments aimed at American workers, part of what officials are calling a “Golden Age of Prosperity. ”“President Trump believes that American workers are the heart and soul of our economy, which is why he’s championed an agenda that always puts them first — from signing the largest middle-class tax cuts in history to securing nearly $10 trillion in new investments to create high-paying jobs across our country,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News.On Truth Social, Trump echoed that message while hoping for tariffs to remain amid legal setback, saying, ""Enjoy your Labor Day weekend.

At an “Investing in America” event in April, NVIDIA promised $500 billion for chipmaking, Apple pledged $500 billion to expand factories, IBM committed $150 billion for AI research, and SoftBank announced a $700 billion infrastructure project. In total, Trump said more than $8 trillion has been pledged since the 2024 election.Officials, quoted by Fox News, also highlighted job creation and workforce programs, citing half a million new jobs added in 2025, $84 million in new training grants, and more than 183,000 apprentices starting this year.Additional measures include a Labor Department push to lower health care costs through price transparency and $61 million in funding to support homeless and at-risk veterans.Fact-checkers noted that the White House’s $10 trillion figure combines previously announced projects with new pledges, and the administration itself described its list as “non-comprehensive.” Still, aides positioned the announcement as part of Trump’s broader economic agenda built on tax cuts, deregulation, and reindustrialization.The economic message was accompanied by visuals of Trump spending the weekend with family at his Trump National Virginia golf course.Online, the rollout was briefly overshadowed by unfounded speculation about the president’s well-being, which trended on social media before his public appearance on Saturday quickly dispelled the rumors.",US President Donald Trump marked Labor Day weekend by spotlighting what the White House described as “nearly $10 trillion” in new investments aimed at American workers.

China's industrial production showed a slight improvement in August but remained in contraction for the fifth consecutive month, as per official figures released on Sunday, while trade negotiations with the United States persist before a new November tariff implementation.The Purchasing Managers' Index, a crucial industrial output indicator, reached 49.4, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), showing a marginal increase from July's 49.3, as reported by AFP. Bloomberg analysts had predicted the index would reach 49.5.The most recent figure above 50, indicating positive growth, was recorded in March.NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe viewed the month-on-month improvement as indication that ""overall economic prosperity continues to expand"". ""The business climate has improved,"" he said.The NBS had previously attributed July's manufacturing difficulties to adverse weather conditions, including floods and high temperatures.China's economic recovery post-pandemic has been challenging, facing issues including a property sector debt crisis, reduced consumption levels and high unemployment rates among young people.The ongoing trade dispute with the United States, currently paused pending negotiations, has affected China's export-driven economy.Both nations have extended their suspension of most reciprocal tariffs until November 10 as discussions continue.On Friday, senior Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang emphasised the need for ""equal dialogue and consultation"" between both countries after completing a three-day US visit, according to China's commerce ministry statement.","Purchasing Managers' Index reaches 49.4, up from July's 49.3.

Putin DIALS Friend Xi, Unites BRICS; China Leader Stuns Trump By Welcoming ‘Warming’ US-Russia Ties





Russian President Vladimir Putin criticised Western sanctions ahead of his four-day visit to China, warning that trade restrictions and the costs of the Ukraine war have pushed Russia’s economy into recession, as reported by Reuters.In a written interview with China’s Xinhua news agency on Saturday, Putin said Russia and China were united in rejecting “discriminatory” measures in global trade.Putin’s trip, which the Kremlin described as “unprecedented,” runs from Sunday to Wednesday. He will first attend the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, before travelling to Beijing for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and to take part in a military parade marking the end of World War Two in Asia.The visit follows Xi’s May trip to Moscow, where the Chinese leader attended a military parade on Red Square celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. It was Xi’s 11th visit to Russia since becoming president.Since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions. US President Donald Trump has also warned of “massive” new penalties unless peace talks progress.Putin, however, praised China’s role in shoring up economic ties. “To sum up, economic cooperation, trade and industrial collaboration between our countries are advancing across multiple areas,” he said. “During my upcoming visit, we will certainly discuss further prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation and new steps to intensify it for the benefit of the peoples of Russia and China.”Russia-China trade hit a record $245 billion in 2024, as Beijing increased purchases of Russian oil and expanded goods sales after Western countries cut economic ties with Moscow. “In recent years, the export of pork and beef to China has been launched. Overall, agricultural and food products occupy a prominent place in Russia’s exports to China,” Putin noted.He added that transactions were increasingly being conducted in rubles and yuan, and highlighted Russia’s role as China’s key oil and gas supplier.Putin did not directly address EU accusations that China has been aiding Russia’s war effort in Ukraine—allegations Beijing has consistently denied.The two leaders declared a “no limits” partnership in 2022 and have met more than 40 times in the past decade. Putin last visited China in 2024, a year after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant against him for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children.","Vladimir Putin says Russia and China are united in rejecting 'discriminatory' measures in global trade.

India ‘Laughs’ As Trump SCREAMS ‘Disaster’ At US Court’s Ruling Against Tariffs | ‘No Power To...’

Tariffs still in place (for now)



A $159 billion refund risk



Trump's negotiating power weakens



Supreme Court showdown looms



Limited backup options on tariffs



Even if the Supreme Court blocks his broad use of IEEPA, Trump still has fallback options — though far narrower.

Trade Act of 1974: Allows tariffs up to 15% for 150 days on countries with big US trade deficits.

Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962: Lets presidents impose tariffs on ""national security"" grounds (used before on steel, aluminium, and autos). But this requires a commerce department investigation and isn't instant.

The road ahead



(with inputs from agencies)





The US federal court's ruling over the tariff, calling it ""illegal"", came as a major setback for President Donald Trump . The court said that the Republican leader overstepped his authority when he declared trade deficits and border issues as ""national emergencies"" to justify sweeping tariffs he imposed on nearly every trading partner.Trump who has wielded tariffs as his favourite weapon in global trade battles, vowed to head toward Supreme Court. The bigger question is: what happens next?The US court of appeals for the federal circuit said that Trump went too far to justify his tariff weapon. The court upheld a May decision by a specialised federal trade court in New York, but allowed the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.The decision was centred on the tariffs Trump imposed in April on almost all US trading partners and the levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.Meanwhile, the court allowed the tariffs to remain in place while Trump appeals. That means businesses, consumers, and foreign governments are still living under the uncertainty of his trade war tactics — at least until the Supreme Court weighs in.US administration fears that if tariffs are ultimately struck down, then the Treasury could be forced to refund billions collected from importers. By July, tariff revenues had soared to $159 billion — more than expected.The justice department had warned that losing the case could mean ""financial ruin"" for the US — a dramatic warning that underscores how deeply tariffs now prop up federal revenue streams.""In such a scenario, people would be forced from their homes, millions of jobs would be eliminated, hardworking Americans would lose their savings, and even Social Security and Medicare could be threatened,"" solicitor general D John Sauer and assistant attorney general Brett Shumate said in a letter to the court, warning of an apocalyptic doomsday if tariffs were struck down.""In short, the economic consequences would be ruinous, instead of unprecedented success,"" the letter added.The ruling threatens one of Trump’s most potent bargaining chips. He has used the threat of tariffs to strong-arm countries into lopsided trade deals — as seen with the EU, Japan, and the UK.Without this tool, experts say, foreign governments may stall on commitments, resist US demands, or even try to reopen old deals. Trump could find himself negotiating from a position of weakness, not dominance.Trump has promised to take the case to the Supreme Court, blasting the appeals ruling as partisan and warning it would ""literally destroy the United States of America"" if upheld.""For many years, Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians. Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again! Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform.The dissenting opinion in the appeals court gives him a potential legal opening: some judges argued that emergency tariff powers do not violate the Constitution. That split makes it almost certain the Supreme Court will take up the case.These tools lack the sweeping, unilateral punch Trump has enjoyed — and could slow his ability to shock foreign governments into concessions.In the short term, Trump's tariffs stand. In the medium term, the Supreme Court will decide whether presidents truly have unchecked emergency powers to upend global trade.If Trump loses, America could face both a massive financial refund and a strategic reset in how it conducts trade negotiations.For now, US businesses, trading partners, and consumers remain trapped in limbo — waiting to see whether Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs mark a new era of presidential trade authority, or an overreach cut down by the courts.","The US court of appeals for the federal circuit said that Trump went too far to justify his tariff weapon.

Special Report.





China's trade representative Li Chenggang conducted meetings in the United States, between August 27-29, engaging with US officials regarding economic and trade relationships between the two nations, according to the Chinese commerce ministry on Saturday, quoted by Reuters.During his visit, Li conducted meetings with officials from the US department of the treasury, department of commerce, and office of the US trade representative to discuss the progress of previously established agreements.Li emphasised that both nations should address their differences and strengthen collaborative efforts through balanced discussions and consultations.This comes as the US Senate Armed Services Committee visited Taiwan on Friday to “reemphasize the partnership and the security, friendship agreement” between the two sides, at a time when both Taipei and Beijing are seeking trade deals with Washington.The US does not formally recognize Taiwan as a country but remains its largest arms supplier and key security partner, with their forces frequently conducting joint military drills to counter China.Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly objected to deepening US-Taiwan ties, condemning such visits and accusing Washington of endangering peace. On Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry reiterated its firm opposition to any official exchanges between the US and Taiwan.However, earlier this month, amid the tense China-Taiwan situation, Trump had said that Chinese President Xi Jinping had assured him China would not invade Taiwan during his presidency, Reuters reported. The comments came in a Fox News interview ahead of Trump’s talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.“I will tell you, you know, you have a very similar thing with President Xi of China and Taiwan, but I don't believe there's any way it's going to happen as long as I'm here. We'll see,” Trump told Fox News’“He told me, 'I will never do it as long as you're president.' President Xi told me that, and I said, 'Well, I appreciate that,' but he also said, 'But I am very patient, and China is very patient,'” Trump added.","China's trade representative Li Chenggang conducted meetings in the United States, between August 27-29, engaging with US officials.

US Budget airline Spirit Airlines announced on Friday that has filed file for bankruptcy again within a year, but will maintain normal operations, ticket sales and flights.Following its initial bankruptcy filing in November, Spirit had completed a debt restructuring agreement with creditors in March, reducing its liabilities by approximately £800 million.""Since emerging from our previous restructuring, which was targeted exclusively on reducing Spirit's funded debt and raising equity capital, it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future,"" said Spirit President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Davis in a statement on Friday, as quoted by Reuters.The Florida-headquartered company indicated that with this new filing, it ""expects to double down on its efforts to"" reorganise its routes, ""rightsize its fleet,"" and seek additional cost-saving measures.Spirit said that ""The Chapter 11 process will provide Spirit the tools, time and flexibility to continue ongoing discussions with all of its lessors, financial creditors and other parties to implement a financial and operational transformation of the Company.""In April, Dave Davis from Sun Country Airlines succeeded Ted Christie as the company's chief executive. Dave Davis, Spirit's president and CEO, said, ""As we move forward, guests can continue to rely on Spirit to provide high-value travel options and connect them with the people and places that matter most.""Still, the company posted a net loss of about $246 million in the three months to end-June. Struggling with a cash crunch, it said last week it had drawn down the full $275 million available under its revolving credit line, as reported by Reuters. Additionally, according to industry analysts and executives, Spirit’s woes trace back to its inability to streamline its inflated cost structure during its first bankruptcy. In the latest quarter, operating expenses reached $1.2 billion—equal to 118 per cent of its revenue.Spirit is also embroiled in a dispute with aircraft lessor AerCap Holdings over a deal for 36 Airbus planes scheduled for delivery in 2027–28. As part of its restructuring plan, the airline said it will scale back operations in select markets and shrink its fleet to meaningfully cut debt and lease liabilities—moves it expects will yield hundreds of millions of dollars in annual operating savings.The low-cost carrier expanded its capacity and market presence following the Covid pandemic but encountered heightened competition from rival airlines.In 2022, competitor Frontier Airlines proposed a £2.9 billion merger with Spirit. Subsequently, JetBlue presented a potentially more valuable offer, but regulatory authorities' antitrust concerns prevented the deal's completion.","Budget airline Spirit Airlines announced on Friday that has filed file for bankruptcy again within a year.

What next?





US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would ""fight back"" after a US federal court in a significant ruling found his global tariffs ""illegal.""The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal; however, it allowed them to remain in place for now, giving the US president time to take the matter to the Supreme Court.A furious Trump termed the court ruling ""incorrect,"" saying that ""ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!""""Today, a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Blown by the decision, Trump flagged that if tariffs ever went away, it would be a ""total disaster"" for US, adding that the country ""will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non-Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe.""""The USA will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non-Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe, that undermine our Manufacturers, Farmers, and everyone else,"" he added.""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" Trump wrote further.The US president underlined that the tariffs imposed by him on several countries, which resulted in a trade war, are ""best tool"" for US workers and ""support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products.""Trump said that for many years tariffs were used against US but now he will approach Supreme Court to make America ""Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again.""The 7-4 ruling by the US court observed: ""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,"" as quoted by Reuters.The decision also noted that the US president had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Federal court's ruling has thrown a roadblock to Trump's path after he audaciously claimed unlimited power to bypass Congress and imposed tariffs on several countries, friends and foes.The decision was centred on tariffs Trump imposed on almost every country on earth on April 2, calling it 'Liberation Day,' as well as levies on China, Mexico, and Canada.The court stated that he overstepped when he declared national emergencies to justify imposing tariffs on several countries.If tariffs are struck down, the US administration argued that it will have to refund some of the import taxes that were collected. It will be a major financial blow for US treasury. According to news report from AP, by July the revenue from tariffs totalled to $159 billion, more than expected. The justice department earlier had said that revoking the tariffs could mean ""financial ruin"" for America.""While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,"" Ashley Akers, a former justice department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision, as quoted by AP.Meanwhile, Trump declared on his social media platform that he will take the fight to the Supreme Court. ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote.While the president still has other legal tools to levy import taxes, they are far more limited.

India in the crossfire

Tariffs hit hard

China steps in





Former US national security advisor Jake Sullivan has launched a sharp attack on Donald Trump’s latest trade move against India, warning that the “massive trade offensive” risks undoing years of work to bring New Delhi closer to Washington - and instead pushing it into Beijing’s orbit.Speaking on The Bulwark Podcast with Tim Miller, Sullivan accused Trump of turning America into a “big disruptor” in the eyes of its allies. He said that while Washington was once seen as a steady hand, it is now viewed as unreliable, even as China gains credibility.“When I go to these places now and I talk to leaders, they are talking about derisking from the United States,” Sullivan said. “They now see the US as the big disruptor, the country that can’t be counted on. China has moved ahead of the United States in popularity in a whole lot of countries… the American brand globally is in the toilet.”Sullivan singled out India as the clearest example of Trump’s missteps.Washington, he said, had worked on a bipartisan basis to build a strategic partnership with New Delhi, particularly to counter China’s growing influence. But Trump’s sudden tariff hikes have strained those efforts.“Take a look at India,” Sullivan said. “Here’s a country we were trying to build a deeper and more sustainable relationship with. Now you have got President Trump executing a massive trade offensive against them and the Indians are saying, ‘Well, I guess maybe we have to go show up in Beijing and sit with the Chinese because we’ve got to hedge against America.’”The critique comes days after the US imposed a steep 50% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 27. The duties - the highest levied against any country - are set to hit Indian sectors like textiles, jewellery, and mechanical appliances, raising fears of lost jobs and slower growth.Trump defended the decision as retaliation for India’s continued purchase of Russian oil. However, analysts say the trigger may be more personal.A report by investment banking firm Jefferies suggested the escalation stems partly from Trump’s anger over not being allowed to mediate in the India-Pakistan conflict earlier this year. Agricultural disputes between the two nations have also deepened the rift.For Sullivan, the damage goes beyond economics. He argued that Trump’s actions hand China a diplomatic victory, with Beijing now able to present itself as a more responsible player on the global stage.“One year ago, China was on the defensive,” Sullivan noted. “Now, countries are basically saying the US can’t be counted on, and China is looking like the adult in the room.”",Former US national security advisor Jake Sullivan criticizes Donald Trump's latest trade move against India.

Canada’s economy shrank at an annualised pace of 1.6% in the second quarter as exports took a hit from tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, Statistics Canada said on Friday. This marked the country’s first GDP contraction in seven quarters.The agency also revised down its first-quarter growth estimate from 2.2% to 2.0%, underscoring the impact of Washington’s trade actions on the world’s ninth-largest economy, AFP reported.Canadian exports fell sharply by 7.5% in the April-June period after a 1.4% rise in the previous quarter. International shipments of passenger cars and light trucks plunged 24.7%, while exports of industrial machinery and equipment dropped 18.5%. Travel services were also down 11.1%, the data showed.The sharper-than-expected decline has raised expectations that the Bank of Canada may move to cut interest rates when it meets in September. The central bank has left its benchmark rate unchanged at 2.75% in its past three policy meetings.However, robust domestic activity partially offset the external shock. Household consumption jumped 4.5% annualized, residential investment rose 6.3%, and government spending increased 5.1%, leading to overall domestic demand growth of 3.5%, according to Reuters.On a monthly basis, June GDP contracted 0.1%, primarily due to a slowdown in goods-producing industries, which make up around a quarter of the economy. “That weaker-than-expected trend in the monthly figures makes today’s release supportive for our forecast of a September interest rate cut,” said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.The contraction raised market expectations for a Bank of Canada (BoC) rate cut next month. Money markets now price in a 48% probability of a September 17 rate reduction, up from 40% prior to the GDP release.An advance estimate for July by Reuters suggested a 0.1% month-on-month expansion, indicating that Q3 could show minimal growth. Royce Mendes, managing director at Desjardins, noted, “While the July flash showed the economy largely recovered lost ground from June, early tracking points to a flat-to-slightly-negative estimate for Q3 GDP.”The Canadian dollar traded lower at 1.3771 per US dollar (72.62 US cents), while yields on two-year government bonds declined 2.8 basis points to 2.664%.Economists noted that jobs and inflation data for August would be critical for the BoC’s rate decision. Despite weak exports, domestic spending strength demonstrates underlying resilience, leaving policymakers with a mixed picture as they weigh potential action.","Canadian exports fell sharply by 7.5% in the April-June period after a 1.4% rise in the previous quarter.

US economy: Fed’s inflation gauge steady at 2.6% in July; core prices edge higher to 2.9%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-price-gauge-steady-in-july-core-inflation-ticks-higher-fed-cautious-on-rate-cuts/articleshow/123585849.cms,"



The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge held steady in July even as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs added pressure on the economy, but a key measure of underlying prices climbed to the highest level in five months.The Commerce Department on Friday said overall prices rose 2.6% in July from a year earlier, unchanged from June, AP reported. Excluding food and energy, core prices increased 2.9% year-on-year, up from 2.8% in June and the sharpest since February.The figures highlight why many Fed officials remain reluctant to ease borrowing costs. Inflation has cooled sharply from its 7% peak three years ago but continues to run above the central bank’s 2% target.The report also offered some signs of resilience in household demand. Consumer spending jumped 0.5% in July, the biggest monthly gain since March, with strong outlays on cars, appliances and furniture. Incomes rose 0.4% over the month, boosted by wage and salary gains.On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices rose 0.2% from June, down from 0.3% in the previous month, while core prices advanced 0.3% for the second consecutive month.The trend closely tracked the consumer price index, which earlier this month showed a 2.7% annual rise, with the core CPI up 3.1% in July.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled that the central bank is likely to cut its key interest rate at its next meeting but stressed that policymakers will proceed cautiously. “It’s not clear how many more rate cuts will happen this year,” he said.When the Fed lowers its benchmark rate, borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business lending typically fall, though not always.Trump, meanwhile, has continued to berate Powell and the Fed over monetary policy. Since earlier this year, the president has labelled Powell “Too Late” and a “moron,” insisting there is “no inflation.” On Monday, Trump sought to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed’s board, in what analysts saw as a bid to assert greater control over the central bank.","Consumer prices rose 2.6% in July from a year earlier, unchanged from June.

H-1B visa bias? Assistant attorney general Dhillon probing cases; 'list continues to grow',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/h-1b-visa-bias-assistant-attorney-general-dhillon-probing-cases-list-continues-to-grow/articleshow/123582516.cms,"After Tariffs, Now U.S. To Deprive Indians Of H-1B Visas? Trump Aide's Big Hint





In a major development of the H-1B row, the US President Donald Trump-led administration is taking action against companies which are discriminating against American workers.The programme, which allows foreign workers to fill roles in the US, has long been criticised for limiting opportunities for native-born Americans.Assistant attorney general for Civil Rights, Harmeet Dhillon, confirmed to Patrick Reports that the department of justice’s (DoJ) civil rights division is actively investigating civil rights complaints linked to the H-1B programme.“Through our Protecting US Workers Initiative, the Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights section has numerous open investigations into hiring practices that discriminate against American citizens, and the list continues to grow,” InfoWars quoted Dhillon.She further added, “We encourage anyone aware of such practices to notify the Civil Rights Division so we can determine if an investigation and enforcement action is needed.”The Indian-American Trump aide took to social media platform X calling out people to send leads against employers.“We have several open investigations and have taken action against some employers already! Send us your leads!”Dhillon has long criticized the H-1B system.""The H1B system is broken and needs reform. What does that have to do with medical education? Nothing, and it’s lazy to conflate the two broken systems,"" she had said earlier.The H-1B visa programme is capped at 85,000 new visas per year, excluding renewals for existing holders. Workers on these visas are often dependent on their employers for legal status, allowing companies to treat them more harshly than American employees and giving them an advantage in the hiring process.The Trump-era department of labour (DOL) also faced scrutiny from the Office of Inspector General over its handling of H-2B applications.While critics argue that the system continues to favour foreign workers, the DOJ’s renewed focus on protecting American employees offers a potential turning point. Citizen activists and job-seekers are now calling for continued pressure to ensure cases of H-1B-related discrimination are prosecuted and legal precedents are set to protect non-visa workers.","The US President Donald Trump-led administration is taking action against companies which are discriminating against American workers.

US postal policy shift: De minimis ends after 86 years- all you need to know about the scrapped rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-postal-policy-shift-de-minimis-ends-after-86-years-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-scrapped-rule/articleshow/123581064.cms,"Representative AI image

What was the De Minimis rule?

What changes now?

Who is affected?





The United States has moved to end its long-standing de minimis tariff exemption for small international packages, eliminating duty-free entry for imports valued at $800 or less.The change, effective Friday, August 29, follows an executive order issued last month and comes nearly two years earlier than the original Congressional timeline. It is expected to affect millions of daily e-commerce deliveries into the US.The de minimis exemption allowed low-value imports to enter the US without paying customs duties, easing cross-border e-commerce. Introduced in 1938 at just $1, the threshold was gradually raised—$5 in 1990, $200 in 1993, and $800 in 2015. In 2023, 1.36 billion packages worth $64 billion entered duty-free under this system, compared with 134 million in 2015, as reported by Economic Times.Both now-president Trump and his predecessor Biden had raised concerns about misuse of the rule, including for smuggling illicit goods such as fentanyl, and its impact on US businesses.Also read: Donald Trump scraps duty-free parcel exemption rule; cites tariff evasion, drug smuggling Starting Friday, all imports will face US customs duties based on their country of origin and product category.Tariff rates range between 10 per cent and 50 per cent- for example, around 10 per cent for shipments from the UK and Australia, and as high as 50 per cent for goods from Brazil and India.Carriers must now file proper documentation for each shipment. Where paperwork is incomplete, they can opt to pay a flat duty of $80–$200 per package for six months as postal systems adapt. Personal gifts worth under $100 and traveller items up to $200 will still enter duty-free.China and Hong Kong dominate the small-package trade, accounting for about 60 per cent of US-bound shipments in 2024. Other major suppliers include Canada, Mexico, the EU, India and Vietnam.The new tariffs are likely to raise prices for online shoppers and reshape global e-commerce flows. Companies such as Shein and Temu, which already have large US distribution networks, may benefit as consumers seek cheaper alternatives despite added duties.","The United States has moved to end its long-standing de minimis tariff exemption for small international packages.

According to government data cited by AP, hiring has slowed significantly since spring. Job gains averaged at 35,000 a month in the three months to July, less than a quarter of last year’s pace.Unemployment benefit claims are a key proxy for layoffs and have mostly stayed in the range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the country emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic more than three years ago.Despite the low level of layoffs, hiring has weakened, a trend many economists now call a “no hire, no fire” economy. The unemployment rate remains at a relatively low 4.2%.Economic growth has also cooled this year, with businesses holding back on expansion plans amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. The economy grew at just a 1.3% annual rate in the first half of 2025, down from 2.5% in 2024, AP reported.The slowdown has increased expectations that the Fed could cut interest rates at its next meeting on 16–17 September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled last week that a reduction in the key rate may be on the cards, which could in turn lower costs for mortgages, car loans and business borrowing.The latest report also showed that the four-week average of claims, which smooths out fluctuations, rose by 2,500 to 228,500.The number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits for the week ending August 16 slipped by 7,000 to 1.95 million. Though slightly lower, that figure is still close to a four-year high, pointing to the difficulties many jobseekers face in securing new work once unemployed.","Applications for jobless aid dropped by 5,000 to 229,000 for the week ending 23 August.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22.

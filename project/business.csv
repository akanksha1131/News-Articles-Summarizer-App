He points out that various assets, including properties and vehicles, become more accessible during such economic downturns.Kiyosaki suggests that the movement of capital from traditional markets towards alternative investments, particularly Bitcoin, presents promising prospects.

RBI announces steps to inject Rs 1.5L crore liquidity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-announces-steps-to-inject-rs-1-5l-crore-liquidity/articleshow/117615421.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI on Monday announced measures to inject over Rs 1.5 lakh crore into money markets, marking the largest monetary easing since the pandemic. These steps aim to address the liquidity shortfall caused by the central bank's intervention in selling dollars to stabilise the rupee.RBI is estimated to have sold over $50 billion from its forex reserves as foreign institutional investors sold stocks. This intervention had led to tighter short-term interest rates and increased borrowing costs. Some market participants view these actions as a precursor to a possible repo rate cut in Feb.RBI's liquidity infusion plan comprises three measures. First, it will conduct a govt bond buy-back worth Rs 60,000 crore in three tranches scheduled for Jan 30, Feb 13, and Feb 20, 2025. Second, the central bank will hold a long-term 56-day variable rate repo auction for Rs 50,000 crore on Feb 7. Finally, it will execute a US dollar-rupee buy/sell swap auction of $5 billion with a six-month tenure. This swap essentially involves RBI borrowing dollars in exchange for rupees, with the interest cost determined by the price at which it agrees to repurchase the dollars at the end of the term.RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra recently met with private bank heads ahead of the upcoming monetary policy review in the first week of Feb. During the meeting, Malhotra emphasised the need to maintain financial stability, expand financial inclusion, improve digital literacy, and enhance access to affordable credit. He also urged banks to strengthen customer service, improve grievance redress mechanisms, and invest in technology.Malhotra also expressed concern over the rising incidence of digital fraud and advised banks to implement robust and proactive systems to combat these threats. He stressed the importance of effective IT risk management and cybersecurity measures, calling for greater oversight of third-party service providers.Market participants see RBI's liquidity measures as laying the groundwork for a potential rate cut. Tight liquidity often prevents rate cuts from being fully transmitted to deposits and loans. Addressing the liquidity deficit will enable any future repo rate cut to be passed on to borrowers more effectively.Bond dealers estimate the liquidity shortfall at approximately Rs 3 lakh crore. RBI assured the market that it would closely monitor evolving liquidity and market conditions, taking necessary measures to ensure orderly liquidity.",RBI is estimated to have sold over $50 billion from its forex reserves.

Key figures around 2120 GMT

NEW YORK: US chip-maker Nvidia led a rout in tech stocks Monday after the emergence of a low-cost Chinese generative AI model that could threaten American dominance in the fast-growing industry.The chatbot developed by DeepSeek, a startup based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, has apparently shown the ability to match the capacity of US AI pace-setters for a fraction of the investments made by American companies.Shares in Nvidia, whose semiconductors power the AI industry, fell nearly 17 percent on Wall Street, erasing nearly $600 billion of its market value.The tech-rich Nasdaq index finished down more than three percent.DeepSeek, whose chatbot became the top-rated free application on Apple's US App Store, said it spent only $5.6 million developing its model -- peanuts when compared with the billions US tech giants have poured into AI.US ""tech dominance is being challenged by China,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB.""The focus is now on whether China can do it better, quicker and more cost effectively than the US, and if they could win the AI race,"" she said.Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, described the market's response Monday as ""shoot first, ask questions later,"" noting that some are skeptical of the Chinese company's assertions.""Everyone is trying to figure out 'Can it be believed?' and 'What does it mean,'"" Hogan said.As DeepSeek rattled markets, the startup on Monday said it was limiting the registration of new users due to ""large-scale malicious"" cyberattacks on its services.AI players Meta and Microsoft are among the tech giants scheduled to report earnings this week, offering opportunity for comment on the emergence of the Chinese company.Shares in another US chip-maker, Broadcom, fell 17.4 percent while Dutch firm ASML, which makes the machines used to build semiconductors, saw its stock tumble 6.7 percent.Constellation Energy, which is planning to build significant energy capacity for AI, sank more than 20 percent.Wall Street's broad-based S&P 500 index shed 1.5 percent while the Dow advanced 0.7 percent.In Europe, the Frankfurt and Paris stock exchanges closed in the red while London finish flat.Asian stock markets mostly slid.Just last week following his inauguration, Trump announced a $500 billion venture to build infrastructure for AI in the United States led by Japanese giant SoftBank and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.SoftBank tumbled more than eight percent in Tokyo on Monday while Japanese semiconductor firm Advantest was also down more than eight percent and Tokyo Electron off almost five percent.Besides tech earnings, this week also sees interest-rate decisions from the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, ahead of American inflation data.Equities enjoyed a healthy run-up last week on the hope that Trump's second administration would take a less hardball approach to global trade.However, his threat Sunday that he would hit Colombian goods with a 25 percent tariff -- rising to 50 percent next week -- and revoke the visas of government officials set off alarm bells.The move came after President Gustavo Petro blocked deportation flights from the United States.In response to Trump's decision, Petro initially announced retaliatory levies of 25 percent on imports from the United States.But Bogota later backed down and agreed to accept the deported citizens, with Foreign Ministuis Gilberto Murillo saying they had ""overcome the impasse.""New York - Dow: UP 0.7 percent at 44,713.58 (close)New York - S&P 500: DOWN 1.5 percent at 6,012.28 (close)New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 3.1 percent at 19,341.83 (close)London - FTSE 100: FLAT at 8,503.71 (close)Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.3 percent at 7,906.58 (close)Frankfurt - DAX: DOWN 0.5 percent at 21,282.18 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.9 percent at 39,565.80 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 0.7 percent at 20,197.77 (close)Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.1 percent at 3,250.60 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0492 from $1.0497 on FridayPound/dollar: UP at $1.2496 from $1.2484Dollar/yen: DOWN at 154.61 yen from 156.00 yenEuro/pound: DOWN at 83.94 pence from 84.08 penceBrent North Sea Crude: DOWN 1.8 percent at $77.08 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 2.0 percent at $73.17 per barrel","China's DeepSeek claims to be able to match the capacity of US AI pace-setters for a fraction of the investments made by American companies.

Retail credit cools as demand slumps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/retail-credit-cools-as-demand-slumps/articleshow/117615859.cms,"MUMBAI: Retail credit growth in India slowed in Q2FY25, with affordable housing and low-cost two-wheeler loans recording the steepest decline. According to the TransUnion Cibil credit market indicator report for the Sept quarter, loans disbursed for affordable housing (up to Rs 35 lakh) fell 12% year-on-year, while loans for houses between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 1 crore dropped by 4%. Low-cost two-wheeler loans (under Rs 75,000) dropped 10%.In contrast, higher-value loans, such as home loans above Rs 1 crore and two-wheeler loans above Rs 1.5 lakh, grew 19% and 11%, respectively, reflecting a tilt toward higher-income borrowers. The report noted a general cooling of retail credit due to slowing demand and tighter supply across most loan products. Credit demand, while positive, hit a two-year low, and supply shrank in most segments except personal loans and credit cards.Personal loans and credit cards bucked the broader decline. Personal loan origination volumes rose 11% year-on-year, though slower than the 32% growth seen in the same period last year. Credit card usage surged, with outstanding portfolio balances increasing 34% year-on-year in Sept 2024, compared to 26% in Sept 2023. This trend indicates a growing reliance on credit cards for consumer spending amid subdued growth in new loans for personal and consumer durable purchases since March 2024.Portfolio balance growth showed mixed results across products. Home loan balances grew 14%, down from 16% a year ago, while loans against property increased by 22%, compared to 28% previously. Auto loans saw balances grow 20%, down from 25%, and two-wheeler loans grew 29%, a sharp drop from 38%. Delinquencies presented a varied picture. Secured products like home loans, loans against property, and auto loans saw improvement in delinquency rates. However, delinquencies rose for consumption-driven loans, including credit cards and personal loans. Credit card delinquencies increased by 31 basis points YoY, while personal loan delinquencies rose by 14 basis points.With global economic uncertainties and slowing urban consumption, lenders are exercising caution.","Retail credit growth in India slowed in Q2FY25, with affordable housing and low- cost two-wheeler loans recording the steepest decline.

New sources, such as Brazil and Guyana, are also emerging. ""We have a wide range of contracts and alliances with all of them.

Rain brings hope amid California wildfires but risks creating a new problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rain-brings-hope-amid-california-wildfires-but-risks-creating-a-new-problem/articleshow/117572112.cms,"Workers secure a net to prevent mudslides over the burned side of a mansion in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood

Recent rainfall in drought-stricken Southern California has brought much-needed hope as it is expected to assist firefighters in managing multiple wildfires. However, the potential for heavy downpours on charred hillsides might create a new problem.Experts are concerned about the toxic ash runoff and debris flows amid the rain.Los Angeles County crews have been working diligently to remove vegetation, shore up slopes, and reinforce roads in areas devastated by the Palisades and Eaton fires, which destroyed entire neighborhoods during powerful winds on January 7. The region is expected to receive around an inch of precipitation over several days, but localized cloudbursts could cause mud and debris to flow down hills.""So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,"" weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. ""That could be enough to create debris flows.""Rainfall began late Saturday and is expected to increase Sunday, possibly lasting into early Tuesday. Flood watches have been issued for some burn areas, while snow is likely in the mountains.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.Officials warned that ash in recent burn zones contains a toxic mix of incinerated materials, including cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture, pesticides, asbestos, plastics, and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been heightened since 2018, when the town of Montecito was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze, damaging hundreds of homes and causing 23 deaths.While the impending wet weather has ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity, several wildfires are still burning across Southern California, including the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday, and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained.In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic. In San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.The rain is expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California, with much of the region receiving less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began October 1.

DeepSeek’s sudden fame strains its systems and draws attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseeks-sudden-fame-strains-its-systems-and-draws-attacks/articleshow/117615910.cms,"Talk of an artificial-intelligence upstart in China behind a formidable ChatGPT rival had been building for days.At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, some mentioned Hangzhou-based DeepSeek and its recently released R1 model as a prime reason for countries such as the US to be doubling down on AI advancements. On tech chat boards, engineers had begun comparing its programming performance to leading models from the likes of OpenAI and Microsoft Corp. Its product quietly rose through the ranks of top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated AI leaderboard.Then, within the past 36 hours, interest in the startup exploded. Silicon Valley heavyweights including investor Marc Andreessen and AI godfather and chief Meta Platforms Inc. scientist Yann LeCun began piling into the conversation, with Andreessen calling DeepSeek’s model “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs” he’s ever seen.By the end of the weekend, DeepSeek’s AI assistant had rocketed to the top of Apple Inc.’s iPhone download charts and ranked among the top downloads on Google’s Play Store, straining the startup’s systems so much that the service went down for more than an hour. The company was eventually forced to limit signups to those with mainland China telephone numbers — but claimed the move was the result of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services.The fallout from the seemingly overnight surge in interest around DeepSeek was swift, and severe: The company’s AI model , which it claims to have developed at a fraction of the cost of rivals without meaningfully sacrificing performance, drove a nearly $1 trillion rout in US and European technology stocks as investors questioned the spending plans of some of America’s biggest companies. The share plunge in AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. alone wiped out a record $589 billion in stock-market value from the world’s largest company on Monday.Some stocks, including Nvidia, later erased some losses in after-hours trading.By Monday, it was clear the overwhelming interest in DeepSeek’s services was taking a toll on the company’s system. “Currently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,” the startup said on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.It was the company’s longest major outage since it started reporting its status. Unlike some rivals, DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.Founded by quant fund chief Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek’s open-sourced AI model is spurring a rethink of the billions of dollars that companies have been spending to stay ahead in the AI race.“While it remains to be seen if DeepSeek will prove to be a viable, cheaper alternative in the long term, initial worries are centered on whether US tech giants’ pricing power is being threatened and if their massive AI spending needs re-evaluation,” said Jun Rong Yeap of IG Asia.Like all other Chinese-made AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed politically sensitive in China. Unlike ChatGPT, DeepSeek deflects questions about Tiananmen Square, President Xi Jinping or the possibility of China invading Taiwan. That may prove jarring to international users, who may not have come into direct contact with Chinese chatbots earlier.The initial success provides a counterpoint to expectations that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy —- an assumption that has driven shares in Nvidia and its suppliers to all-time highs.The exact cost of development and energy consumption of DeepSeek are not fully documented, but the startup has presented figures that suggest its cost was only a fraction of OpenAI’s latest models. That a small and efficient AI model emerged from China, which has been subject to escalating US trade sanctions on advanced Nvidia chips, is also challenging the effectiveness of such measures.“The US is great at research and innovation and especially breakthrough, but China is better at engineering,” computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee said earlier this month at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong. “In this day and age, when you have limited compute power and money, you learn how to build things very efficiently.”For its part, Nvidia — the biggest provider of chips used to train AI software — described DeepSeek’s new model as an “excellent AI advancement” that fully complies with the US government’s restrictions on technology exports. The startup’s work “illustrates how new models can be created” using a technique known as test time scaling, the company said.Nvidia’s statement appeared to dismiss some analysts’ and experts’ suspicions that the Chinese startup couldn’t have made the breakthrough it has claimed. The company also pointed out that inference, the work of actually running AI models and using it to process data and make predictions, nonetheless requires a lot of its products.“Inference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking,” the company said.","Hangzhou-based DeepSeek and its recently released R1 model is a prime reason for countries such as the US to be doubling down on AI advancements.

Low-cost China AI model shakes global markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/low-cost-china-ai-model-shakes-global-markets/articleshow/117615581.cms,"MUMBAI: Global markets went into a fresh turmoil on Monday after a Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released its low-cost AI model that prompted tech analysts to question if the current high valuations for giants like Nvidia, Google and Microsoft were justified. As a result, in early trades on Wall Street on Monday, Nvidia lost as much as 18% that also wiped off about $560 billion from the AI chip giant's market value - largest in market history. For perspective, that's nearly equal to the combined market value of the top three companies in India: Reliance Industries, TCS and HDFC Bank.Initial test results for DeepSeek R1 model showed better efficiency compared to the latest version of ChatGPT, currently the global leader in AI applications. Analysts now feel that the low development and running costs of the Chinese AI model with better results than ChatGPT could lead to a massive slide in stock prices of high cost AI-chip manufacturers like Nvidia, TSMC and others.Earlier in the day, trading on Dalal Street was also impacted by the global turmoil on the back of DeepSeek's superior performance and its implications for global tech giants. Combined with relentless foreign fund selling, the sensex closed 824 points down at 75,366 points, a more than seven-month closing low. Technology stocks led the slide.With US markets deep in the red in early trades and the US Federal Reserve's rate setting committee meeting scheduled later this week, domestic investors are still edgy, market players said. However, they could take some solace from GIFT Nifty index, a proxy for start of trading in the domestic market for the next session, which was in the positive territory late on Monday.On Dalal Street on Monday, the sensex opened in the red and lost steam through the session to close near the day's low. In addition to the global cues, tepid corporate earnings and uncertainty around US trade policy also impacted investor sentiment, said Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.","Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released its low-cost AI model that prompted tech analysts to question if the current high valuations for giants like Nvidia, Google and Microsoft were justified.

Investor concerns

Global repercussions



Accusations and scepticism

Wall Street faced a major shock on Monday as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek emerged as a formidable competitor, triggering a sell-off in US tech stocks . NVIDIA , one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, saw its stock plunge by almost 17%, closing at $118.58 . This came after DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded in 2023, announced its latest AI model, R1, which reportedly matches US-developed models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.The news unsettled investors, who fear that such advancements could disrupt the lucrative AI supply chain that has driven Silicon Valley’s growth. “This is AI’s Sputnik moment,” venture capitalist Marc Andreessen told news agency AP.The impact was immediate and widespread. The S&P 500 dipped 1.7%, with tech stocks suffering the brunt of the losses. Shares of Microsoft and Meta Platforms, both heavily invested in AI infrastructure, saw sharp declines, while bond yields fell as investors sought safer assets.The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.1% on Monday, dragged down by sharp losses in Big Tech, including Nvidia’s 17% plunge. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5%, its worst day in over a month, while utilities linked to AI data centres also slumped. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, as stocks outside AI-related industries held steady amidst the turmoil sparked by DeepSeek’s announcement of a cost-efficient AI model.DeepSeek gained international attention after its AI assistant app climbed to the top of Apple’s free app chart in the US over the weekend. The company claims its R1 model demonstrates advanced reasoning abilities, similar to OpenAI’s most expensive systems, but at a fraction of the cost. Analysts have noted that DeepSeek may have bypassed US-imposed restrictions on accessing NVIDIA’s cutting-edge chips, a claim that remains under scrutiny.Gregory Allen of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, “The timing of DeepSeek’s release is strategic, potentially undermining US efforts to maintain technological dominance through export controls.”NVIDIA’s dramatic 17% slump highlights growing investor fears that the AI gold rush, which had propelled the company to a trillion-dollar valuation, could be under threat. The company’s stock had soared from under $20 to over $140 in just two years, fuelled by explosive demand for AI chips.“This news questions the economics of AI investments,” said analyst Kathleen Brooks of XTB. “If China can produce comparable models so cheaply, US tech giants may need to reassess their strategies.”DeepSeek’s announcement also rattled international markets. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML saw its shares drop 7%, while Japan’s SoftBank fell 8.3%. In the US, Constellation Energy shares plummeted nearly 20% after the company announced plans to restart a nuclear plant to power AI data centres.Amid the panic, industry figures like Elon Musk have raised suspicions that DeepSeek may have secretly accessed banned Nvidia H100 chips. However, Hong Kong-based investor Jen Zhu Scott dismissed these claims, stating, “It sounds like a rich kids’ team got outplayed by a poor kids’ team.”Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon remained cautious, saying, “DeepSeek’s models are impressive but not miraculous. The market reaction appears overblown.”","Nasdaq drops 3.1% as AI-driven sell-off hits big tech. S&P 500 drops 1.5%, its worst day in over a month.

NEW YORK: The tech-rich Nasdaq tumbled early Monday as traders around Wall Street and other global bourses reacted to the emergence of a low-cost Chinese generative AI venture that has apparently overtaken US companies.DeepSeek , which was developed by a start-up based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, has shown the ability to match the capacity of AI pace-setters such as Nvidia , which sank more than 11 percent Monday, giving up some $400 billion in market value.The tech-rich Nasdaq led major indices lower, falling 2.7 percent, with AI players Meta, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet all firmly lower.DeepSeek said they spent only $5.6 million developing their model -- peanuts when compared with the billions US tech giants have poured into AI.US ""tech dominance is being challenged by China,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.

Innovation has always defined the crypto market, but Ethereum (ETH) is transforming the space by introducing smart contracts and a basis for distributed apps (dApps). Rexas Finance is positioned to revolutionise asset trading and ownership with a strong ecosystem, innovative use cases, and a fast-growing community.Real-world asset tokenising is blockchain digital tokenisation of physical assets, including real estate, commodities, intellectual property, and luxury goods. These tokens reflect fractional ownership, enabling anyone to invest valuable assets without requiring large capital. This idea offers a window into the future of world finance by democratising wealth-building opportunities and raising asset liquidity. However, for RWA tokenisation to be fully realised, a strong blockchain environment is required, and that's where Rexas Finance can help.Rexas Finance is a platform meant to enable the flawless tokenisation, trading, and management of actual assets, and it is not only a cryptocurrency project. Selling 411.4 million tokens, priced at $0.175 during its 11th presale, RXS has already raised over $38.6 million and is fast becoming a game-changer in the cryptocurrency market. Rexas Finance is bringing tools and infrastructure to enable RWA tokenisation for the general public, just as Ethereum presented a fresh paradigm with smart contracts.1.One main feature distinguishing Rexas Finance from others is the advanced tokenisation of real-world assets tradeable on its blockchain. This enables intermediary stakeholdings, which gives current investors the capacity to diversify into spaces that were previously the sole terrain of institutional investors.2.The integration of artificial intelligence provides customers with real-time statistics and predictive models for asset performance. This technological edge sets Rexas Finance apart from its competitors and aligns it with future finance trends.3.The platform’s Certik audit guarantees investors of its security and reliability. This level of transparency and confidence is vital in a market that requires a robust base to attract retail and institutional investors.4.Rexas Finance is building a borderless financial environment by combining blockchain technology with conventional finance. Its capacity to reach RWAs worldwide reflects Ethereum's influence on distributed apps and DeFi.Ethereum helped set the groundwork for blockchain innovation by adding smart contracts that run anything from distributed exchanges to NFT markets today. As the preferred platform for fractionalising and trading real-world assets, Rexas Finance has the same ability to accomplish RWA tokenisation. Rexas Finance democratises access to high-value assets, enabling anyone to engage in wealth-building prospects, as Ethereum made blockchain technologies available to developers. Early investors in Ethereum witnessed great gains as the platform's value and acceptance developed. With RXS currently in its presale phase at $0.175, early adopters can position themselves for exponential development. Ethereum's success rests in its capacity to host a large spectrum of dApps. Similarly, Rexas Finance is creating an ecosystem supporting tokeniSed assets ranging from intellectual property to real estate across sectors.The worldwide RWA tokenising market will be worth a trillion dollars over the next decade. This development drives demand for asset liquidity, blockchain knowledge, and higher institutional use. Rexas Finance is ideally situated in this regard to profit from the growing demand.The excitement around Rexas Finance is mounting. Early adopters drawn to the project's original approach and solid foundations are seasoned investors and crypto whales. As the presale picks up, the token is drawing interest as one of the investment prospects of 2025. Furthermore, listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and its strong security add credibility.Like Ethereum, Rexas Finance faced competition and government inspection issues in its early years. Still, its clear road map and emphasis on innovation helped it overcome these challenges. The opportunity resides in its ability to acquire a big piece of the RWA tokenisation market, which remains mostly untapped. If successful, Rexas Finance might fight Ethereum and carve out its legacy in the blockchain arena.Rexas Finance is more than a promising cryptocurrency; it’s a pioneer in the RWA tokenisation revolution. RXS has the potential to become as transforming as Ethereum was for dApps and DeFi with its presale price of $0.175 and aim to democratise access to high-value assets. Rexas Finance is one initiative that might change the financial scene as the crypto sector looks beyond 2025 and beyond. For investors seeking the next Ethereum-like opportunity, RXS offers a strong reason to act immediately and grab a seat in this innovative enterprise.","Rexas Finance (RXS) aims to revolutionise asset trading and ownership with a strong ecosystem, innovative use cases, and a fast-growing community.

The consumer price index, excluding food, for the month of December alone showed a 3% rise.Another long-term concern was wage growth. Recent data show Japanese workers are gaining better wages and are generally set to receive solid pay raises in their upcoming annual union negotiations.The labor ministry adjusted its wage data for November to a rise of 0.5%, instead of a decline, helping to support the Bank of Japan's decision.The central bank has signaled that more interest rate raises may be coming, while stressing it plans to be extremely cautious to ensure the economy holds steady.Share prices fell after the announcement, as the value of the Japanese yen gained against the US dollar. A rate rise in July last year sent stock prices tumbling. The bank is also watching for market reactions to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.The Bank of Japan increased the rate for the first time in 17 years in March last year, ending its negative interest rate policy, which amounts to negative borrowing rates.Japan's longtime ultra-lax monetary policy was meant to wrest the economy out of deflationary tendencies and boost growth. Deflation stagnates growth, as companies invest less, cut back on wages and people hold back on spending.Japan's stance is at odds with the loosening trends adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have been cutting rates after raising them to clamp down on inflation. The Fed indicated recently it will slow the pace of rate cuts.",The Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate to about 0.5% from 0.25% Friday. The decision came at the end of a two-day policy board meeting in Tokyo.

Justin Trudeau warns Donald Trump over tariff threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/prices-for-americans-will-go-up-trudeau-warns-trump-over-tariff-threat/articleshow/117503660.cms,"Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump (R)

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.Trump announced earlier in the day that he intends to apply a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, with implementation potentially starting as soon as February 1. He had previously threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China immediately after taking office, but they were not implemented on his first day.Speaking in Ottawa, outgoing PM Trudeau pointed out that Canada would respond with retaliatory tariffs if Trump moves forward. ""Whether it be back on January 20th, on February 1st or February 15th as a Valentine’s Day present, or on April 1st or whenever, Canada will respond,"" Trudeau said. ""Prices for American consumers on just about everything will go up. We don’t think he wants that.""The tariffs would target a wide range of products and could disrupt key markets, including autos, lumber, and oil. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith cautioned that Americans in some states could see gas prices increase by more than a dollar per gallon if Canadian oil faces additional tariffs. Despite Trump’s assertion that the US does not need Canada, nearly 25% of America’s daily oil consumption is supplied by its northern neighbour.Canada is also a critical supplier of 34 essential minerals and metals, as well as the largest foreign source of steel, aluminium, and uranium for the US Trudeau highlighted the importance of bilateral cooperation.""The US should be working even more with Canada on our energy, on our critical minerals, on the goods they need to deliver the economic growth that Donald Trump has promised,"" he said. ""That is our first choice. If they do move forward on tariffs, we are ready to respond in a strong way but in a way to figure out how to get them removed as soon as possible.""Canada is reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs on US products such as orange juice, toilets, and certain steel goods. This would mirror the response in 2018, when Canada imposed billions of dollars in duties after Trump raised tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. ""Everything is on the table,” Trudeau said. “It would be bad for Canada, but it would also be bad for American consumers.""The economic relationship between the two countries is significant, with nearly Canadian dollars 3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in goods and services crossing the border daily. Canada is also the top export destination for 36 US states. However, Trump has remained focused on border issues, linking Canada and Mexico to the flow of fentanyl into the US""We have highlighted that less than one percent of illegal drugs coming into the United States, less than one percent of migrants going into the United States, come from Canada, but we’re still investing over a billion dollars and strengthening our border,"" Trudeau said.Trump has also frequently mischaracterised the US-Canada trade relationship, claiming a $200 billion trade deficit, which experts have debunked. During a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum, he suggested a drastic solution. “You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we don’t have a deficit. We won’t have to tariff you,” he said.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs.

I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,” Trump told journalists in the Oval Office.“If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 — we’ll up it for all the inflation — I think I’d probably go.”During his first term, Trump broke tradition by making Saudi Arabia, rather than the UK, his first international destination in 2017.The visit also highlighted close relations with the supreme leaders of oil rich Gulf states and presence of his real estate empire across the regions.The public run Saudi Press Agency, stated that the investment was discussed during a telephonic conversation between Trump and the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom.“The crown prince affirmed the kingdom’s intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,” the report stated.However, it did not specify the details of the investment.In recent years, the US has drawn away from reliance on Saudi’s oil exports which had been the foundation of their close ties for decades.At present, Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well.The White House did not comment on the call.The crown prince also spoke with US secretary of state Marco Rubio.Trump maintained close ties with Saudi Arabia, even after the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, which was linked to the crown prince.",Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday announced that he is looking forward to investing a staggering $600 billion in the United States in the upcoming four years.

After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines. The recent launch of a spectacularly successful meme coin helped SOL reach its all-time high yet again. Speculators predict further growth, but several challengers are rising fast.For one, a new TON-based token has the potential to rival this success. Thanks to its significant utility and systemic importance, this token could be a top performer this cycle.After a major rally at the start of the bull market, Solana (SOL) is once again in the headlines. The “Ethereum killer” has attained new highs thanks to a major memecoin launch. Namely, just days before his inauguration, President Donald Trump launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) token. The token quickly attained a staggering valuation of $10 billion, making Trump one of the richest men alive.The token’s launch on Solana has created a market frenzy, pushing Solana to its new ATH at $290. Despite the subsequent volatility, Solana is still up 42% over the past seven days, trading at $254. Now, experts predict that the token can go even higher.The launch of Trump and Melania tokens on the network will likely boost its credibility. At the same time, Trump’s favourable stance toward crypto may prove to be even more consequential. If Solana cements its position as the meme coin hub, it has further potential to expand.Despite Solana’s significant growth, it is not without its challenges. Among them is TON , another high-performance blockchain with several aces up its sleeve. For one, TON has a deep connection with the Telegram messaging app.Telegram provides TON with access to its 950 million users. At the same time, it also enables real-world applications for the network. For one, TON-based apps are becoming more popular on Telegram. For example, popular clicker apps like Notcoin drew significant engagement.TON is also expanding into several new areas. Just in time for the next meme coin rally, TON has revealed a major partnership. Ethereum-based GraFun memecoin launchpad has recently joined the TON platform. This platform will enable the easy creation of meme coins on TON, just as Pump.fun did for Solana.Thanks to these developments, TON emerges as a potential Solana challenger. Moreover, the recent launch of Elluminex (ELX) could further boost its potential. The project aims to be the main trading hub for TON, injecting much-needed liquidity into the chain.Elluminex works as a DEX with cross-chain bridges to 40 major blockchains. This way, it helps bring together liquidity across major chains. This is crucial, as the introduction of major DEXs has had a significant impact on token prices.For instance, since the launch of Raydium, Solana grew from $1.5 to more than $200 in a single year. Ethereum saw similar effects after the launch of Uniswap, as did BNB with PancakeSwap. These examples showcase the importance of liquidity for the chains.Elluminex will also enable low-slippage trading with self-custody, appealing both to large traders and retail players. Thanks to the fact that the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to more than rival Solana’s performance.","After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines.

Reflecting a good blend of stability and growth, Cardano (ADA) noted green days in 53% of the last 30 days.Cardano (ADA) is still among the promising altcoins to watch given its strong fundamentals and bullish investor sentiment. Reiterating the positive sentiment shown on the Cardano price chart, indicators including the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages flash buy signals However, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) currently shows sale signals, indicating a possible pullback. Looking forward, analysts are bullish on Cardano (ADA) in 2025.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

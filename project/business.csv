Reducing Russian crude imports: India eyes Iran oil?





India-US trade deal is contingent on India curbing its Russian crude oil imports, US trade negotiators have reportedly told Indian officials. Trade officials from the United States have informed India's negotiators that a curb in Russian oil imports is essential for lowering India's tariff rates and finalising a trade agreement, sources told Reuters.Last month, President Donald Trump increased tariffs on Indian products to 50% of which 25% tariffs are of India’s crude oil imports from Russia. India responded firmly, maintaining its position on Russian purchases and describing US actions as ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.""A US official told the news agency that whilst trade talks with India were progressing well, further discussions were necessary to resolve American concerns about market access, trade imbalances and India's ongoing procurement of Russian oil.According to a Bloomberg report, US trade representatives emphasised to their Indian colleagues that addressing the Russian oil issue was essential for reducing India's tariff rates and finalising a trade agreement. Despite positive dialogue this week, no major progress was achieved, according to the report.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal , leading the Indian delegation, proposed increased purchases of American defence and energy products as concessions, the report said.On Wednesday, Goyal expressed India's willingness to increase energy imports from the US ""in the years to come.""Also Read | Trump’s 100% pharma tariffs: How bad will India's pharmaceutical exports be hit? ‘Low-cost generic model may offer cushion’ The trade discussions in the US from September 22-24 were productive, with both parties discussing potential agreement parameters, according to the Commerce Ministry statement Goyal conducted meetings with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Sergio Gor, Trump's India ambassador nominee. The minister also engaged with Indian business leaders and investors during his visit.In a separate report, Bloomberg said that India has asked US to allow it to import oil from Iran and Venezuela.Russia started offering discounted oil prices following international sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict. India, which imports about 90% of its oil needs, has benefited from reduced import costs through Russian supplies. Iranian and Venezuelan oil could offer comparable price benefits.The report indicated that Indian refiners would need US nod to import crude from sanctioned nations like Iran and Venezuela if they were to significantly reduce Russian oil purchases.The visiting delegation conveyed their message during talks with Trump officials, the report said.Also Read | Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike impact: Germany, UK, Canada roll out red carpet for India’s tech talent; pitch ‘predictable’ rules Those familiar with the negotiations revealed that Indian officials highlighted how simultaneously limiting their refiners' access to Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil could lead to a global price increase.Meanwhile, Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday said that Russian crude oil purchases face no sanctions, whilst cautioning about severe global implications if these supplies face disruption.He referenced Iran and Venezuela as examples, noting that India has consistently adhered to international sanctions as a responsible global community member.Puri highlighted Russia's position as the global second-largest crude supplier, delivering approximately 10 million barrels daily, whilst emphasising potential worldwide ramifications of supply interruptions.""Energy is something you cannot do without ... If you remove the second-largest producer, you will have to cut consumption. The consequences are pretty serious,"" Puri said.Also Read | India’s exports to US plunge!

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"
Rare earth elements: President Murmu says India must become self-reliant; ‘important for ensuring national security’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rare-earth-elements-president-murmu-says-india-must-become-self-reliant-important-for-ensuring-national-security/articleshow/124153727.cms,"



President Droupadi Murmu on Friday highlighted the need for India to become self-reliant in producing rare earth elements, saying this is vital in the current geopolitical climate and will play a key role in the country’s journey towards becoming a developed nation.Speaking at the National Geoscience Awards 2024, she further added that it would ensure the security of the country.The President explained that these minerals are not considered rare because of their limited supply, but because the process of identifying them is highly complex. She also highlighted that developing homegrown techniques would be crucial in overcoming this challenge.President Murmu pointed out that rare earth elements are central to the technologies shaping the modern world, from artificial intelligence and semiconductors to clean energy solutions.The rare earth elements or REEs are a group of 17 chemically alike metallic elements which are of vital importance to the development of modern technologies including smartphones, electric vehicles, renewable energy systems and wind turbines.She said the mines ministry is working to ensure sustainability and innovation in the sector, with projects that include AI- and drone-based surveys and efforts to extract valuable materials from mine tailings.The President also used the occasion to highlight the need for better disaster preparedness. Referring to the heavy damage caused this year by cloudbursts and landslides, she urged scientists to strengthen research into floods, landslides, earthquakes and tsunamis.""It is my appeal to the geoscientist community to pay more attention on the research of natural calamities like flood, landslide, earthquake, and tsunami,"" she said, adding that new technologies should be developed to ensure timely alerts reach the public.Instituted in 1966 by the mines ministry and earlier known as the National Mineral Awards, the National Geoscience Awards remain one of the country’s most prestigious honours in the geoscience field.","President Droupadi Murmu highlighted the need for India to become self-reliant in producing rare earth elements.

Silver at record high! Price hits Rs 1.41 lakh/kg as festival demand soars; gold up Rs 330/10g,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-at-record-high-price-hits-rs-1-41-lakh/kg-as-festival-demand-soars-gold-up-rs-330/10g/articleshow/124164734.cms,"AI image





Silver prices experienced a substantial surge of Rs 1,900, reaching a new record of Rs 1,41,900 per kilogram, while gold increased by Rs 330 in the national capital on Friday due to strong stockist demand and festival-related purchasing, as reported by the All India Sarafa Association, quoted by PTI.Silver, which had previously closed at Rs 1,40,000 per kilogram, continued its upward trend due to strong physical demand and investor interest, according to the association.Since December 31, 2024, silver prices have increased by Rs 52,200 per kilogram or 58.19% from Rs 89,700 per kilogram. The continuous rise in silver prices is attributed to the current festival season, increased industrial usage, and heightened safe-haven purchasing amidst global uncertainties. Market participants indicated that despite weak global indicators, domestic bullion markets remained strong due to consistent purchasing by jewellers, stockists, and retail buyers.Meanwhile, pure gold (99.9%) increased by Rs 330 to Rs 1,17,700 per 10 grams (all taxes included), from its previous value of Rs 1,17,370 per 10 grams on Thursday.Gold of 99.5% purity increased by Rs 400 to Rs 1,17,100 per 10 grams, compared to Rs 1,16,700 per 10 grams in the previous trading session.Gold prices have increased by Rs 38,750 per 10 grams, or 49.08%, from Rs 78,950 per 10 grams since December 31, 2024, demonstrating significant growth due to consistent investor interest and seasonal demand. ""Gold traded with a modest positive bias on Friday, supported by haven buying, while a general risk-off sentiment in broader markets continued to strengthen demand for precious metals,"" said Saumil Gandhi, Senior Analyst - Commodities at HDFC Securities.""Meanwhile, US President Trump announced a new round of tariffs on imported drugs, trucks, and furniture set to take effect on October 1. This announcement renewed trade-related uncertainty and increased demand for safe haven metals,"" he added.""Silver hit a fresh record high in the domestic market, taking bullish cues from global markets. The white metal rose above USD 45 an ounce for the first time in 14 years, driven by strong inflows into ETFs, high demand, and tighter physical availability,"" Gandhi further noted.Internationally, both precious metals showed decline. Spot gold decreased by 0.12% to USD 3,744.75 per ounce, while silver reduced by 0.35% to USD 45.03 per ounce.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), October gold futures increased by Rs 391 or 0.35% to Rs 1,13,020 per 10 grams. December gold futures also rose by Rs 198 or 0.17% to Rs 1,14,069 per 10 grams.December silver futures increased by Rs 1,243 or 0.90% to reach Rs 1,38,299 per kilogram. March 2026 silver futures also achieved a new high, increasing by Rs 1,225 or 0.88% to Rs 1,39,627 per kilogram on the MCX.Market analysts noted that recent increases in domestic bullion prices were primarily demand-driven, supported by festival purchases and anticipated global monetary easing. ""With central banks continuing to diversify their reserves and the rupee showing signs of weakness, precious metals are likely to remain well supported,"" they added, as quoted by PTI.In international markets, December gold futures increased by 0.28% to USD 3,781.82 per ounce while December silver futures rose nearly 2% approaching a 14-year high of USD 45.93 per ounce.","Silver prices experienced a substantial surge of Rs 1,900, reaching a new record of Rs1,41,900 per kilogram.

India, Brazil and South Africa have raised concerns over unilateral tariffs and other coercive trade measures, saying such steps risk destabilising global markets and undermining the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ).At a meeting under the IBSA framework (India, Brazil, South Africa), the three nations described these measures as ""discriminatory"" and ""inconsistent"" with WTO rules.The meeting was attended by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Brazilian foreign minister Mauro Vieira, and South African minister Sindisiwe Chikunga.The ministers had also urged for urgent reforms to the UN security council, Jaishankar said.In a statement, IBSA stressed the importance of a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial global trading system.It added, ""They (the ministers) reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen the centrality of the rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, fair, equitable, open, and inclusive multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core and its role in promoting predictability, stability, legal certainty and a level playing field for international trade.""Last month, the US imposed 50% tariffs on India and Brazil, raising tensions further.The ministers expressed ""serious concern over the imposition of unilateral tariff and other discriminatory and protectionist measures, particularly measures used as a means of coercion, noting that such actions are inconsistent with the WTO and risk undermining the rules-based multilateral trading system as well as destabilising world markets fostering greater fragmentation and instability.”The three countries also highlighted their commitment to reforming and strengthening the multilateral trading system.

NEW DELHI: Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday said the India–Russia relationship remains steady despite Washington’s tariffs and political pressure, adding that New Delhi has made clear it will not be dictated to on foreign partnerships.Lavrov, who was responding to questions on the sidelines of an event, pointed to the resilience of bilateral ties even as the US accused India of buying “massive oil” from Russia.“(The economic partnership between India and Russia) is not under threat… The Indian Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have made it clear that India chooses its own partners,” Lavrov said.On India-Russia relations, Lavrov said, ""This year, my colleague, I spoke to him yesterday, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, will visit Russia and I will visit India. We hold regular exchanges. I'm not even asking what is going to happen to our trade relations, our oil. I don't ask our Indian colleagues this. They are perfectly capable of making these decisions for themselves. And publicly, my friend, whom I referenced earlier when he was asked a similar question, said, if the US wants to sell their oil to us, we are prepared to discuss the terms for this. But what we buy from other countries, not the United States, but from Russia or other countries, that's our own business.And that has nothing to do with the Indian-US agenda. And I believe that that is a very worthy response that shows that India, like Turkey, has self-respect.""Lavrov’s remarks come as Washington intensifies scrutiny of India’s oil imports from Russia, claiming the revenues aid Moscow’s war in Ukraine, which led to a 50% tariff on Indian goods under the Donald Trump administration. Despite this, the Russian minister emphasized that Moscow and New Delhi are continuing cooperation across sectors, undeterred by external pressure.",Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the India–Russia relationship remains steady.

NEW DELHI/HYDERABAD: India's generic companies are likely to continue in business-as-usual mode as US President Donald Trump's 100% levy on pharmaceuticals is targeted at branded and patented medicines, but it may also prompt some of them to rethink their playbook.Industry experts told TOI that the country's largest drugmaker Sun Pharma could face headwinds as its drug sales in US totalled $1.1 billion in FY25 (in which patented drugs have a significant portion), which was around 17% of its total revenue. Analysts added that branded biosimilars manufactured by companies, including Biocon, may be affected.Companies with manufacturing bases in US - including Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's and Cipla - could cushion the blow by shifting production of higher-value specialty and niche drugs from India to the American facilities, said experts. Over time, the move could drive companies to diversify export markets, recalibrate global strategies, shift to contract manufacturing in the US and set up manufacturing bases there to safeguard access to the world's most lucrative market.""At this point, we do not see an impact,"" Dr Reddy's co-chairman & MD G V Prasad said, adding, the company also does not see expanding its manufacturing footprint in the US immediately.""Domestic companies are examining all options to mitigate risk, ranging from setting up manufacturing facilities in the US to shifting production of high-value specialty drugs, niche therapies and peptides to existing plants,"" an industry expert said. India's pharma exports to the US were close to $10 billion last year and it serviced around 35% of US prescriptions with affordable generics.""India plays a vital role in US healthcare by ensuring a steady supply of affordable medicines. A majority of life-saving cardiac, diabetes and chronic medicines are supplied from India,"" said Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance secretary general Sudarshan Jain. Deepak Jotwani, VP & sector head, corporate ratings, Icra added, ""Overall, this move by the US underscores the need for Indian pharma companies to diversify markets and innovate in complex generics and biosimilars to stay resilient in a changing global trade landscape. ""Pharmexcil chairman Namit Joshi said most large Indian companies already operate manufacturing or repackaging units in US and are exploring further acquisitions. ""India will need to reinforce its cost-efficiency advantage in bulk drugs and APIs, an area where the US is likely to favour India over other suppliers, and simultaneously invest in next-generation opportunities, such as complex generics, peptides and biosimilars. ""The pharma sector is awaiting more clarity on the announcement as it did not specify whether speciality drugs, niche or complex generic drugs are under its ambit. However, a few experts said there was uncertainty over the definition of ""branded"" drugs. ""If we take the terms branded and patented products at face value, Granules does not fall into either category,"" Granules India ED Priyanka Chigurupati said.","US President Donald Trump's 100% levy on pharmaceuticals is targeted at branded and patented medicines.

Kurdistan oil exports: Iraq resumes supply after two-year halt; over $35 bn revenue lost during shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/kurdistan-oil-exports-iraq-resumes-supply-after-two-year-halt-over-35-bn-revenue-lost-during-shutdown/articleshow/124180465.cms,"



Iraq has restarted oil exports from its autonomous Kurdistan region, ending a suspension that lasted more than two years because of legal disputes and pipeline closures.Baghdad’s oil ministry confirmed on Saturday that crude is once again moving through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline. The line, which had been closed since 2023, has been at the centre of long-running disagreements between the federal government and Kurdish authorities in Arbil over who controls the region’s oil wealth.The State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO) will now handle 190,000 barrels per day for export and allocate a further 50,000 barrels for local consumption, its director Ali Nizar told AFP. Turkish energy minister Alparslan Batraktar also announced on X that flows through the pipeline had begun again on Saturday morning.Previously, Kurdish officials sold oil abroad without Baghdad’s approval, mainly through Turkey’s Ceyhan port. That practice was halted in March 2023 after the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris ruled the exports illegal and confirmed that only Iraq’s federal government could market the country’s crude.A breakthrough came in July, when Baghdad and Arbil agreed that all oil from Kurdistan’s fields would be transferred to SOMO.Another deal, signed on Thursday with international oil companies, cleared the final hurdle for exports to restart.US secretary of state Marco Rubio welcomed the move, saying Washington had “facilitated” the agreement and that it would “strengthen the mutually beneficial economic partnership between the United States and Iraq”.The stoppage has been costly. The Association of the Petroleum Industry of Kurdistan (APIKUR) estimates Iraq lost more than $35 billion in revenue during the shutdown. Eight oil companies operating in Kurdistan have now signed on to resume exports, though they also want talks with Kurdish authorities within 30 days to address more than $1 billion in unpaid expenses.Norwegian operator DNO ASA has opted out, insisting that resuming exports should only happen “pursuant to agreements that ensure payment surety”.Oil is Iraq’s economic backbone, making up about 90% of state revenue. The country, a founding member of OPEC, currently exports 3.4 million barrels per day, according to SOMO figures reported by the INA news agency.","Iraq has restarted oil exports from its autonomous Kurdistan region.

"'For national & economic security': Trump admin mulls chip-based tariffs on foreign electronics, says report – what it means",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/for-national-economic-security-trump-admin-mulls-chip-based-tariffs-on-foreign-electronics-says-report-what-it-means/articleshow/124175917.cms,"PM Modi Will Soon Dedicate India’s 1st Made-In-India Semiconductor Chip From Sanand Plant: Vaishnaw

What will be the impact if tariff gets imposed?







The Donald Trump-led US administration is considering a plan to impose tariffs on imported electronic devices depending on the number of chips in each one of them, Reuters reported, citing three sourcesUnder the proposal, the US commerce department would calculate tariffs as a percentage of the product’s estimated chip value, in a move designed to push manufacturers to shift production to America.""America cannot be reliant on foreign imports for the semiconductor products that are essential for our national and economic security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Reuters, regarding the matter.""The Trump administration is implementing a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshoring critical manufacturing back to the United States with tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance,"" Desai added.Uncertainty remains about the scope of products that would be affected, tariff rates, and possible exemptions.The commerce department was weighing a 25% rate on chip content, and 15% for electronics from Japan and the EU, though figures were still preliminary, a source told the agency.If implemented, the policy would apply to a broad range of consumer goods, from toothbrushes to laptops, potentially raising costs for US households.Economists warned it could also worsen inflation. According to Michael Strain, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, the move would push up consumer prices ""at a time when the US has an inflationary problem, with inflation clearly above the Fed's target and accelerating.""He added that even domestically produced goods could get costlier due to higher tariffs on imported inputs.Trump has already rolled out sweeping tariffs this year, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% on heavy-duty trucks. Earlier in April, his administration launched probes into pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, calling foreign reliance a national security threat.A potential exemption linked to investments in US manufacturing, dollar-for-dollar credits only if a company shifts half its production to America, has been discussed but not finalised.Meanwhile, earlier proposals to exempt chipmaking tools faced pushback from the White House, with sources saying Trump dislikes carve-outs.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, the world’s biggest non-US chipmakers, could be among the hardest hit.","The US commerce department would calculate tariffs as a percentage of the product’s estimated chip value.

Trump Political Vendetta? After Ex-FBI Comey, Trump Names His Next Target





US President Donald Trump on Friday publicly demanded that Microsoft dismiss Lisa Monaco, the company’s president of global affairs and a former top official in Democratic administrations.In a lengthy Truth Social post, Trump claimed ‘corrupt and totally Trump deranged’ Monaco posed risks to national security because of her past government roles. “She is a menace to US National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government,” Trump wrote.“Because of Monaco’s many wrongful acts, the US Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances, took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence, and banned her from all Federal Properties.”Trump added that “it is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco.”According to news agency Reuters, Monaco began working at Microsoft in July, taking charge of the firm’s global engagement with governments. Her LinkedIn profile confirms the appointment.She previously served as a national security aide under Barack Obama , helped coordinate the justice department’s response to the January 6 Capitol attack, and was deputy attorney general during Joe Biden ’s administration.Trump linked his demand to Monaco’s role in the Biden justice department, which pursued legal cases against him. He argued that her senior position at Microsoft, with access to sensitive information, was “unacceptable.”The criticism comes after former FBI director James Comey, a longtime Trump adversary, was indicted on obstruction and perjury charges.Trump has said he expects “others” to face prosecution, according to Reuters.The attack on Monaco highlights Trump’s broader pattern of targeting perceived political enemies. Since returning to the White House in January, he has pushed for charges against several figures, including former national security adviser John Bolton and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, and has exerted pressure on institutions ranging from law firms to universities.The president’s interventions have also extended into corporate America. His administration previously demanded the resignation of Intel’s chief executive, pressed Disney’s ABC over comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s show, and influenced decisions at other major firms.Meanwhile, Microsoft continues to navigate its relationship with the administration. Earlier this month, CEO Satya Nadella attended a White House dinner with Trump and other technology leaders.The company has also been under scrutiny for its contracts with US agencies and, separately, for restricting certain cloud services to a unit of the Israeli military following a review of alleged surveillance practices, reported CNBC.",US President Donald Trump publicly demanded that Microsoft dismiss Lisa Monaco.

Algo diplomacy: How Xi Jinping used TikTok to court Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-signs-tiktok-order-xi-jinping-bytedance-ltd-us-china-trade-deal/articleshow/124161748.cms,"AI image for representation only.

TL;DR: Driving the news

Big Win For Trump Amid Trade Faceoff With China, TikTok Algorithm Now Under American Oversight

Why it matters

The TikTok manoeuvre isn’t just about data privacy or algorithms. It’s about leverage the in ongoing US-China trade war.

Xi's quiet greenlight - not yet officially confirmed by Beijing - is part of a larger effort to reset US-China ties on China’s terms. And Trump, who once threatened to ban the app outright, now gets to tout himself as the man who saved TikTok and satisfied national security hawks.

As per a New York Times report, at its core, this is a story about how Xi Jinping turned a tech headache into a diplomatic lever, and how Donald Trump transformed a national security threat into a personal political win.

Interestingly, both leaders are using TikTok - a wildly popular app among American youth - to serve entirely different agendas:

For Xi: TikTok is no longer Beijing’s tech crown jewel. It’s a bargaining chip. China now sees more value in trading it for potential relief on US tariffs, export restrictions on AI chips, and diplomatic breathing room around Taiwan.

TikTok is no longer Beijing’s tech crown jewel. It’s a bargaining chip. China now sees more value in trading it for potential relief on US tariffs, export restrictions on AI chips, and diplomatic breathing room around Taiwan. For Trump: TikTok is a campaign lifeline. He credits it for helping him reach young voters in 2024 and boasts 15 million followers on the platform. Now, he gets to claim he “saved TikTok,” appeased security hawks, and secured a deal that looks tough on China - without actually banning the app.

TikTok is a campaign lifeline. He credits it for helping him reach young voters in 2024 and boasts 15 million followers on the platform. Now, he gets to claim he “saved TikTok,” appeased security hawks, and secured a deal that looks tough on China - without actually banning the app. The timing also matters:

Beijing is under pressure: With economic headwinds at home, mounting Western export controls, and a post-pandemic slowdown, China is recalibrating its tone with Washington.

The US is headed toward a tech decoupling cliff: The deal sets a precedent for how Chinese tech can (or can’t) operate inside the American ecosystem - especially around algorithms, user data, and influence risks.

Congress is watching: The deal's structure - a licensed algorithm, American-controlled board, Oracle oversight - could become a template or a cautionary tale.

""It’s not just about who owns the app,"" Jasmine Enberg of Emarketer told AP. ""It’s about who controls the algorithm, the data, and ultimately, the narrative.""

In short: This isn’t a tech transaction. It’s a calculated act of tech diplomacy - one that could shape the next phase of the US-China rivalry and redefine the limits of digital sovereignty.

The big picture

What’s in the deal:

ByteDance keeps under 20% ownership and one board seat in the new company, TikTok US.

Oracle and Silver Lake will lead the investor group, alongside Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Trump also name-checked Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch as investors.

Oracle gets algorithm oversight. The TikTok algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance, retrained solely on US data, and supervised by “trusted” American partners.

Data storage stays in Oracle’s cloud, with no ByteDance access to US user info.

Between the lines

What they are saying

“Young people really wanted this to happen,” Trump said.

He also admitted he would make TikTok “100% MAGA” if he could - though he insists the new app will be fair to “every philosophy.”

“There’s much bigger fish to fry,” Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington, told the NYT. “If China can use these small concessions to trade for a positive atmosphere, better US-China relations, they will want to do it,” she said, referring to TikTok.

""It’s not just about who owns the app,"" Jasmine Enberg of Emarketer. ""It’s about who controls the algorithm, the data, and ultimately, the narrative.

Bloomberg Opinion’s Catherine Thorbecke put it: “In China, ‘win-win’ means China wins twice.”

What’s next

The TikTok deal may be just Act I. Trump and Xi are expected to speak again soon - possibly setting up a summit next month during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.

Such a sit-down would mark their first in-person meeting since Trump returned to the White House - and could shape the next phase of global tech, trade, and military diplomacy.

Xi reportedly wants to host Trump in Beijing - both for symbolism and control. China is wary of another diplomatic misfire, like Ukraine’s Zelensky being publicly scolded at the White House.

Congressional review: Lawmakers are not convinced this setup truly complies with the 2024 law. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar says he plans to “discuss these issues with the transaction parties.”

Beijing’s final word: China must still issue a license for the algorithm’s export - a critical step that could derail or delay implementation.

Tech decoupling accelerates: Even if the TikTok deal succeeds, the broader push to sever strategic tech ties with China continues - from semiconductors to AI models.





President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday endorsing a $14 billion deal that would spin off TikTok’s US operations from its Chinese owner ByteDance. The move aims to meet the legal requirement set by a 2024 law forcing ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the US.But the headline-grabbing deal is more than a tech breakup. It’s a strategic olive branch from China - and President Xi Jinping appears to be playing a long game.“I had a very good talk with President Xi,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “We talked about TikTok and he gave us the go-ahead.”As the New York Times and Bloomberg have noted, China’s sudden acquiescence to a divestment it once labeled “robbery” has sparked questions about what’s being traded behind the scenes - and whether the most valuable export here isn’t TikTok’s algorithm, but goodwill from Beijing.The TikTok deal is part tech workaround, part geopolitical theater. On paper, it creates a US-based joint venture with a mostly American board and ownership structure. In reality, it’s a finely tuned diplomatic signal.JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, said the deal will put the new TikTok’s valuation at “roughly $14 billion” - a figure that Emarketer says aligns with its expected 2026 ad revenue.The algorithm - TikTok’s secret sauce - is at the center of the national security debate. While ByteDance keeps ownership, the new algorithm will be “rebuilt from the ground up” with Oracle's oversight, per US officials.“American investors will actually control the algorithm,” Vance emphasized.Still, skepticism remains: “Has ByteDance truly lost control?” asked Alan Rozenshtein of the University of Minnesota. “That’s far from clear.”Meanwhile, Beijing has been deliberately vague. No formal statement of approval. No confirmed export license. But state-run media described the deal as a “win-win,” and Xi’s silence suggests strategic consent - not surrender.(With inputs from agencies)","TikTok algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance, supervised by “trusted” American partners.

US stocks were trading in green on Friday, buoyed by a combination of factors including renewed hopes for more rate cuts and US President Donald Trump's announcing new tariffs, including a 100% import tax on foreign-made pharmaceutical drugs, starting next week.Dow Jones soared 369 points or 0.8% to reach 46,316 while Nasdaq jumped 71 points or 0.32%, trading at 22,455.S&P 500 also followed the trajectory, reaching 6,641, gaining 36 points or 0.56% at 7:20 PM IST.Investors were encouraged by a fresh inflation report, which suggested the Fed may have room to reduce rates further. Meanwhile, Trump’s new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, heavy trucks, and other imports created modest market reactions rather than major upheaval. US pharmaceutical companies rose slightly, while home-furnishing retailers slipped.Trump said on social media that foreign furniture and cabinetry makers were “flooding the United States” and tariffs were needed “for National Security and other reasons.” Shares of home-furnishing companies responded with losses: Wayfair and Williams-Sonoma fell nearly 3%, and RH dropped 5%.He also targeted foreign-made heavy trucks and parts, claiming they hurt US producers, though most trucks are either manufactured domestically or are US brands built in Canada or Mexico.Shares of Paccar, an American truck maker, jumped 6%.Dow component Boeing gained more than 3% after reports that federal safety regulators plan to ease oversight of the company.Investors are closely watching Friday’s US consumer spending data, which includes the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Stocks have faced pressure this week after reports suggested the US economy may be stronger than expected. While that is good news for workers and jobseekers, it could limit the Fed’s ability to cut rates multiple times in the coming months.The Fed delivered its first rate cut of the year last week and had signalled further reductions through next year, which has helped drive US stocks to record highs since April. Easier rates boost economic growth and encourage investors to pay higher prices for stocks and other assets. The Fed will consider Friday’s inflation figures and labour market data when deciding its next move in late October.","Dow Jones soared 369 points or 0.8% to reach 46,316.

Turkish Airlines has announced plans to expand its fleet through a major deal with US-based Boeing. In a Friday filing to the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Turkey's national carrier said it aims to add up to 225 aircrafts.The airline said it will purchase 75 Boeing 787-9 and 787-10 Dreamliners, including 50 confirmed and 25 optional orders, with deliveries slated between 2029 and 2034. These long-haul aircraft are described as advanced and fuel-efficient, tailored for international routes, as reported by AP.In a parallel deal, Turkish Airlines finalised negotiations for 150 Boeing 737-8/10 MAX jets—100 confirmed and 50 optional orders—and will move ahead once engine supplier CFM International completes talks. The company is also negotiating with Rolls-Royce and GE Aerospace for engines, spare parts and maintenance services for the new fleet.The announcement came a day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met US President Donald Trump in Washington. This marks a pivot from the earlier standing between the two nations as, during Trump’s first term, the US removed Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program in 2019 over Ankara’s purchase of a Russian air defense system. However, Trump has recently signaled that Washington may soon lift its hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to the Nato ally.With this expansion, Turkish Airlines will continue to be one of the world’s largest flight networks, connecting Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.","Turkey's national carrier said it aims to add up to 225 aircrafts.

Indian Pharmaceutical Industry Unfazed by Trump’s 100% Tariff on Imported Medicines, Denies Impact





Asian drug stocks fell on Friday as investors reacted to US President Donald Trump ’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on imported branded pharmaceuticals starting October 1.Companies without existing US manufacturing plants could face the full impact, triggering declines across major drugmakers in South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong.In South Korea, Samsung Biologics fell 1.6%, while SK Biopharmaceuticals slid 2.6%. Celltrion, which recently acquired ImClone Systems from Eli Lilly in the United States for $330 million, rose 1.3% after recouping earlier losses.In Japan, Sumitomo Pharma tumbled 4.3%, Otsuka Holdings dropped 3.5%, and Daiichi Sankyo lost 1.6%. Takeda added 0.2%, and Shionogi gained 1.3%.Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Biotech Index fell about 2.58%.Markets had already been braced for further tariffs and investigations by the US commerce department, said Carol Kong, economist and currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.""The sectoral tariffs are here to stay because those have proven to be more legally sound than the emergency tariffs that the lower courts judged to be illegal,"" she said.""Sectoral tariffs are going to push the US government's effective tariff rate a little bit high - it was about 10% in August, we expect the global effective tariff rate to edge further to about 18% in the coming months,” added Kong, as quoted by Reuters.Kong added that the broader impact on economies like Japan and Australia may be fairly limited.","Asian drug stocks fell on Friday as investors reacted to US President Donald Trump ’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on imported branded pharmaceuticals starting October 1.Companies without existing US manufacturing plants could face the full impact, triggering declines across major drugmakers in South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124149992,imgsize-913862,width-400,resizemode-4/1-21.jpg"

Dollar strengthens, commodities rise







Asian markets opened cautiously on Friday after US President Donald Trump announced a fresh set of tariffs, while investors lowered expectations for significant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts following stronger-than-anticipated economic data.Trump revealed plans to levy a 100% tariff on imported branded pharmaceuticals, 25% on heavy-duty trucks, and 50% on kitchen cabinets. He also said that bathroom vanities would face a 50% duty and upholstered furniture a 30% tariff, all effective from October 1.Japan’s Topix pharmaceutical index (.IPHAM.T) declined 1.4%, while Australian biotech company CSL dropped over 3%. The Nikkei lost 0.5%, and the MSCI Asia-Pacific index outside Japan fell 0.45%.“R ig ht now, this adds to a somewhat fragile environment for risk assets,” said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, as quoted by Reuters.In the US, futures reflected investor caution, with Nasdaq contracts down 0.08% and S&P 500 futures slipping 0.02%. Meanwhile, European futures posted modest gains, with EUROSTOXX 50 contracts up 0.37% and FTSE futures rising 0.25%.Investor sentiment was further dampened as expectations of aggressive Fed easing were tempered by robust economic indicators.Economists at Wells Fargo noted that recent GDP figures confirm the US economy’s resilience in the first half of the year despite unpredictable trade policy.Traders now anticipate roughly 39 basis points of rate reductions by December, slightly lower than the 40-plus basis points forecast earlier this week. “Markets had built in optimism for four to six cuts, but now it looks like four is the most likely scenario, and even that may be generous,” said Sycamore.While most Fed officials remain cautious on future rate moves, newcomer Stephen Miran has advocated for sharp reductions to avoid a labor market downturn, reported Reuters.The dollar strengthened in response, hovering near 150 yen. The euro last traded at $1.1668, down 0.6% from the previous session, while sterling remained steady at $1.3344.Commodity prices saw modest gains, with Brent crude rising 0.24% to $69.59 per barrel and US crude climbing 0.43% to $65.26 per barrel. Trump also indicated confidence that Turkey would comply with US requests to reduce Russian oil imports, hinting at the potential lifting of sanctions to allow Ankara to acquire advanced American F-35 jets following talks with President Erdogan.Spot gold inched higher to $3,751.69 an ounce.","US President Donald Trump announced a fresh set of tariffs on Friday.

US President Donald Trump on Friday announced a 100% tariff on pharma products, along with 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on October 1.The announcements came in a series of posts on his social media platform indicating that he remains committed to tariffs beyond the trade frameworks and import taxes introduced in August.""Starting October 1st, 2025, we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America. 'IS BUILDING' will be defined as, 'breaking ground' and/or 'under construction',"" he said in a post on Truth Social.""There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Announcing the tariffs on trucks, he said, ""In order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition, I will be imposing, as of October 1st, 2025, a 25% Tariff on all “Heavy (Big!) Trucks” made in other parts of the World. Therefore, our Great Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions.We need our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong, for many reasons, but above all else, for National Security purposes!""""We will be imposing a 50% Tariff on all Kitchen Cabinets, Bathroom Vanities, and associated products, starting October 1st, 2025. Additionally, we will be charging a 30% Tariff on Upholstered Furniture. The reason for this is the large scale 'FLOODING' of these products into the United States by other outside Countries. It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he said.Trump has argued that tariffs will encourage domestic investment, dismissing concerns that higher import taxes raise costs for consumers and businesses.He claimed inflation was under control, despite the consumer price index rising 2.9% over the past year. There was also little evidence that tariffs were creating jobs or new manufacturing facilities, with manufacturers cutting 42,000 jobs and builders reducing 8,000 since April.","US President Donald Trump on Friday announced a 100% tariff on pharma products, along with 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on October 1.

Wall Street struggled on Thursday, heading toward a rare three-day losing streak as investors digested stronger-than-expected US economic data and corporate results.The S&P 500 fell 0.7% in early trading, marking a deeper decline than the previous two days, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 107 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite slid 1%. All three indexes remained close to the record highs set earlier this week, AP reported.Economic reports showed fewer US workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, suggesting layoffs may be slowing. The US economy also grew faster in the spring than previously estimated, and orders for manufactured goods with a relatively long life span exceeded forecasts, adding pressure on expectations for future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields ticked higher, with the 10-year note rising to 4.17% and the two-year yield climbing more sharply.CarMax tumbled 19.1%, the largest loss in the S&P 500, after reporting weaker quarterly profits and fewer vehicle sales compared with last year. Loss projections from past loans also weighed on the stock.Big Tech stocks, which have driven recent market gains, also fell. Nvidia declined 1.8%, Broadcom lost 2.9%, and Alphabet dropped 2.2%, reflecting investor caution about high valuations amid artificial intelligence enthusiasm.Starbucks fluctuated between modest gains and losses after announcing a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes store closures and cutting 900 non-retail jobs, most recently down 0.7%.European markets followed a weaker trend, with Germany’s DAX falling 1% and France’s CAC 0 down 0.7%, after Asia saw a more muted finish.","The S&P 500 fell 0.7% in early trading, marking a deeper decline than the previous two days.

The US economy grew at an unexpected 3.8 per cent annualised pace in the second quarter, significantly higher than the previously estimated 3.3 per cent, government data showed Thursday. The revision highlights a strong rebound from a first-quarter contraction of 0.6 per cent and underscores the influence of shifting trade patterns on the country’s economic performance.Imports, which surged earlier in the year as businesses rushed to beat tariff deadlines, fell by 29.3% in the second quarter, AP reported. The drop added more than five percentage points to GDP, the department noted. Consumer spending also accelerated, rising at a 2.5% pace compared with 0.6% in the first quarter.The Trump administration has imposed double-digit tariffs on imports ranging from steel and aluminum to autos, a move the president argues protects US industry and offsets the cost of his sweeping tax cuts. “With tariffs, we are bringing factories back and making America strong again,” Trump has repeatedly said.But mainstream economists caution the protectionist strategy risks slowing growth and fuelling inflation.They argue tariffs are paid by US importers, who often pass costs to consumers. While inflationary effects have so far been modest, economists warn the unpredictable tariff rollouts have unsettled businesses and dampened hiring.Labour Department data revisions this month showed that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the year ending March than first reported, pulling the monthly average down to 71,000. Since March, job growth has slowed further, averaging just 53,000 a month.The Fed, seeking to support the labour market, cut its benchmark interest rate last week for the first time since December. The Commerce Department will release its initial July-September GDP estimate on October 30, with economists surveyed by FactSet forecasting growth to slow to 1.5%.","The US economy grew at an unexpected 3.8% annualised pace in the second quarter, significantly higher than the previously estimated 3.3%.

Starbucks is laying off around 900 non-retail employees and shutting some stores in the US and Canada as part of a broader turnaround strategy, the company announced on Thursday. Employees who are being eliminated will be informed early Friday, while the closures will be rolled out in the coming days.The Seattle-based coffee chain said a review of its North American locations showed many outlets were underperforming financially or not meeting customer expectations. “Each year, we open and close coffeehouses for a variety of reasons, from financial performance to lease expirations. This is a more significant action that we understand will impact partners and customers. Our coffeehouses are centers of the community, and closing any location is difficult,” Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol wrote in a letter to staff, as quoted by AP.Following the move, Starbucks expects to end its fiscal year with 18,300 stores in North America, down 124 from last year. It is unusual for the company to reduce its store count within a fiscal year.Niccol, a turnaround specialist brought in a year ago to revive Starbucks, previously led Chipotle through a dramatic recovery. During his six-year tenure there, the brand doubled its revenue and profit while its stock price soared.Starbucks said it will offer severance and support packages to employees affected by the layoffs.","Starbucks is laying off around 900 non-retail employees and shutting some stores in the US and Canada.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

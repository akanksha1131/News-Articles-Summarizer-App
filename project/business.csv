Top stock market recommendations:Nifty has hit its initial target of 25050 – 25250 from the point it reversed after closing above 24600. With index closing near to its 4 week highs, tailwind momentum is likely to push it to the next target of 25250 on the upside while dips below 24985 are set to get bought into with support seen at 24850.After dropping over 5% from its recent highs, Bank Nifty has shown some short covering since the start of this week after the gap up opening on Monday. Any closing above 55800 is likely to set the toner for further bullishness on the index while a retest of 55500 – 55550 is likely to act as buy on dip for the index for a 3-4% rally unfolding from current levels.The stock of Godawari Power and Ispat Limited had been trading in a range since last few months and has given a highest close in calendar year 2025 yesterday with very strong volumes. Breakout after such long consolidation often leads to explosive move.A quick 12-15% move can be seen on the stock to reclaim its all time high.The stock of Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Ltd has been forming base since last few months and some initial signs of momentum has started to show up with stock giving positive close with strong volumes. Auto stocks have been gaining traction and we expect the ancillary stock to also perform well going forward.

A close above 800 will lead to rise in momentum for a quick 6-8% move.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Godawari Power and Ispat Limited, Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Ltd, and HDFC Life are the top buy calls for today.

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold has declined by 1.60% this week, indicating a continuation of the ongoing correction phase. The metal has faced sustained selling pressure amid global uncertainties and strength in the US dollar, leading to weakness in bullion prices. Currently, gold is approaching a key support level at ₹97,000. This level has previously acted as a strong demand zone, and a short-term bounce from this point is expected. However, the overall sentiment remains cautious.If gold manages to hold above ₹97,000, a temporary recovery toward ₹97,500–₹97,800 could be seen. Traders may look for opportunities to buy on dips around this level with a tight stop-loss. On the other hand, if the ₹97,000 support is broken decisively with strong volume and momentum, it could trigger further downside, with the next immediate support seen near ₹96,500. A break below this level would confirm a deeper correction, potentially opening the door for further bearish price action.Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD are showing weakness, reinforcing the corrective outlook. Overall, while a short-term rebound is possible near support, traders should remain cautious and watch for a confirmed break below ₹97,000 to assess further downside potential.MCX Silver has witnessed renewed selling pressure after breaking key support levels recently, signaling weakness in the short term.This breakdown has shifted market sentiment to bearish, as traders react to a lack of bullish momentum and a stronger dollar environment. The breach of previous support zones has opened the path for further downside, with prices now likely to test the crucial support level at ₹1,09,000.This support zone is considered significant as it has held firm in past corrections, and market participants will be closely watching price action around this level. A sustained move below ₹1,09,000 could accelerate the selling, potentially dragging prices even lower in the near term. However, if this level holds, a short-term rebound could materialize, offering intraday buying opportunities with strict risk management.On the upside, resistance is now seen at ₹1,11,970. Any recovery in prices will likely face selling pressure near this resistance zone, which previously acted as a support. Bulls would need to push prices above this level decisively to regain control and signal a possible trend reversal.Until then, the bias remains negative. Traders are advised to follow a sell-on-rise approach, keeping a close watch on support at ₹1,09,000 for directional cues.","Gold prices have been dipping and a key support level is seen to be Rs 97,000.

Nayara Energy navigates EU sanctions: Dark-fleet tankers keep operations flowing; government steps in to protect India’s oil supply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nayara-energy-navigates-eu-sanctions-dark-fleet-tankers-keep-operations-flowing-government-steps-in-to-protect-indias-oil-supply/articleshow/123422336.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

India Matters Very Much: Russia's Shoutout To 'Friend' Amid Tariff War, Moscow Slams US Sanctions

About Nayara Energy

India's Nayara Energy Ltd., facing EU sanctions, has adapted by utilizing dark-fleet tankers for transport and limiting its crude import options to maintain operations.Indian government has expressed concern about potential disruptions to oil flows affecting national energy security. They have authorised at least one coastal tanker recently to assist the company with domestic cargo movement, according to informed sources, cited by Bloomberg.The Rosneft PJSC-affiliated refiner plays a crucial role in India's market, operating 8% of the country's refining capacity with its 400,000 barrels-a-day facility and managing 7% of fuel stations. Operating capacity has decreased after business partners withdrew following EU measures against Moscow's oil revenues.In a relief measure, the government has approved several sanctioned vessels for Nayara's operations. The Leruo, a dark-fleet vessel, has conducted at least three domestic operations for Nayara with governmental approval, as confirmed by shipping data and an unnamed shipowner.The EU blacklisted the medium-range tanker Leruo on July 18 as part of broader Russian oil export sanctions affecting Nayara. Key Marvel Ltd.appears as the vessel's owner in S&P Global Inc.'s maritime records.The Next, another EU and UK-sanctioned long-range tanker, is scheduled to collect diesel from Nayara's Vadinar terminal on Wednesday, according to port records and tracking data. Next Maritime & Trading Ltd. in Istanbul is listed as the owner.These vessels are replacing local shipowners who have ceased operations with Nayara to protect their European port access and insurance arrangements. Vessels with Russian or Iranian insurance, approved by New Delhi, can service Nayara.Currently, Nayara has refined products exceeding 1.2 million barrels stored on four sanctioned vessels near Vadinar, according to shipping records.The Tempest Dream, after transferring Nayara-produced gasoline via ship-to-ship transfer, has returned to Vadinar for additional cargo. The recipient vessel, Wu Tai, remains holding its cargo.Since late July, Nayara has exclusively imported Urals oil from Russia. Two Aframax tankers, Mars 6 and Tiger 6, are expected to deliver approximately 1.4 million barrels of Urals this week.Meanwhile, the Greek-owned supertanker Evgenia I, intended to deliver Middle Eastern crude to Nayara last week, remains in the Persian Gulf.Evgeny Griva, Moscow's deputy trade representative in India, confirmed stable Russian crude supply to Nayara during a New Delhi briefing on Wednesday. He indicated that Indian imports of Russian oil should maintain current levels, citing limited alternatives despite geopolitical challenges.""There are special mechanisms to get around sanctions and tariffs,"" Griva said, quoted by Bloomberg.In August 2017, Essar Oil's 20-million-ton-per-annum Vadinar refinery in Gujarat underwent a significant transformation when it was acquired by a consortium led by Rosneft. This acquisition led to the rebranding of the entity as Nayara Energy, a name that signifies a ""new era"" in Hindi, reflecting the consortium's vision for the refinery's future growth and development.The launch of Nayara Energy coincided with pivotal changes in India's petroleum sector, particularly the government's decision to deregulate fuel retail prices. This move leveled the playing field, allowing private retailers like Nayara to expand their networks, as reported by the Economic Times.The liberalization of the market stirred concerns among state-run oil marketing companies, which had long dominated fuel retailing. They feared losing market share to private competitors such as Nayara and Reliance Industries.Nayara Energy experienced steady growth until it faced challenges due to sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. These sanctions targeted Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine, making Nayara's oil and energy revenue particularly susceptible to geopolitical tensions.The acquisition of the Essar facility by Rosneft, along with international investors Trafigura and UCP Investment Group, was valued at $12.9 billion. This marked Rosneft's largest overseas investment in India's refining sector, granting it access to one of the world's fastest-growing markets.","Rosneft PJSC-affiliated refiner plays a crucial role in India's market, operating 8% of the country's refining capacity.

Air Canada strike: Restart plan suspended as union defies return-to-work order; prolonged standoff deepens travel chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/air-canada-strike-government-ends-flight-attendants-walkout-services-to-resume-but-cancellations-linger/articleshow/123345627.cms,"Air Canada suspended its planned restart of operations on Sunday after flight attendants refused to comply with a government back-to-work order that they called “unconstitutional. ” The order had required them to return to duty by 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but the union vowed to continue its strike, prolonging widespread cancellations and travel disruptions.Earlier today, Air Canada announced that it will restart flights on Sunday evening after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants that left more than 100,000 travellers stranded during the peak summer season.The airline, Canada’s largest, said it will take several days before operations return to normal and warned that some flights would remain cancelled over the next seven to 10 days until schedules stabilise.Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered attendants back to work less than 12 hours after they walked off the job at 1 a.m. on Saturday, citing the broader economic impact, AP reported.“Now is not the time to take risks with the economy,” Hajdu said, pointing to the unprecedented tariffs the US has imposed on Canada.The dispute has been referred to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which extended the current collective agreement until a new one is decided by arbitration.The walkout had paralysed operations of the carrier, which runs nearly 700 flights daily. The shutdown was affecting about 130,000 passengers a day. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said Air Canada had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, following 199 cancellations on Friday. Another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.The union had rejected Air Canada’s earlier request for government-directed arbitration, escalating the conflict. The government previously forced two major railroads into arbitration during a strike last year, a move unions challenged in court, arguing it weakened labour’s bargaining power. In this case, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed Ottawa’s intervention, and the Business Council of Canada had also urged binding arbitration.Hajdu stressed that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government is “not anti-union,” but added it was clear both sides were at an impasse.Air Canada announced that passengers affected by cancellations would be eligible for full refunds through its website or mobile app. It also promised to arrange alternative travel with other Canadian and foreign airlines “where possible,” but cautioned that immediate rebooking could not be guaranteed as flights on other carriers were already full during the busy summer season.The airline and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) have been negotiating for nearly eight months without success. Pay remains the most contentious issue. Air Canada said its latest proposal offered a 38% increase in overall compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, a package that “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.”The union disagreed, arguing that the proposed 8% raise in the first year fell short of addressing inflation and raised concerns about the unpaid work flight attendants perform when aircraft are not in the air.","Air Canada flight attendants refused to comply with a government back-to-work order that they called “unconstitutional” The order had required them to return to duty by 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but the union vowed to continue its strike, prolonging widespread cancellations and travel disruptions.

RBI seeks debate on inflation targets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-seeks-debate-on-inflation-targets/articleshow/123442857.cms,"RBI

Mumbai: The RBI is re-examining how it targets inflation in its monetary policy. It has however made a strong case for continuing with existing targets. In a discussion paper released on Thursday, the RBI sought public feedback on four questions: should headline or core inflation guide policy; is 4% still the right target; should the +/-2% band be adjusted; and should the fixed 4% midpoint be replaced by a simple range of 3-6%. Responses are due by Sept 18th.The review, due to conclude by March 2026, marks the second formal assessment of the flexible inflation-targeting (FIT) framework since its adoption in 2016, and follows a global trend of central banks consulting more openly on policy.The RBI's verdict so far is that FIT has worked. Since 2016, average inflation has dropped to 4.9% from 6.8% in the pre-FIT years, while volatility has fallen from 2.3% to 1.5%. The framework proved resilient during the pandemic and again during the Ukraine war, when inflation breached the 6% ceiling. In both cases the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was able to shift priorities, first supporting growth, then moving quickly to rein in prices.But new uncertainties ranging from climate change to volatile commodities, shifting global finance and innovations in payments are straining the framework.The case for retaining headline inflation is strong. Food and fuel make up more than half of India's consumption basket; ignoring them would make the index less representative. RBI also argues that excluding food inflation would overlook the welfare of the poor, for whom food dominates household budgets. Persistently high food prices influence public expectations and can spill into core inflation. Raghuram Rajan, a former RBI governor, has warned that excluding food would risk eroding public trust. Empirical evidence shows that food and fuel prices tend to converge with core inflation over time, making them too important to ignore.The paper reaffirms the logic of India's 4% inflation target and the +/-2% tolerance band. The 4% midpoint is supported by evidence that fast-growing economies, due to the Balassa-Samuelson effect, can sustain slightly higher inflation. The wide band is justified by India's unusually high share of food in its price index.",RBI seeks public feedback on four questions: should headline or core inflation guide policy; is 4% still the right target; should the +/-2% band be adjusted; and should the fixed 4% midpoint be replaced by a simple range of 3-6%.

Investor sentiment hit

Models to be reworked

MUMBAI: For venture capital (VC) investors who have infused several million dollars into gaming startups, the sweeping ban on online real-money gaming (RMG) has put their investments at risk. Some investments could be written off and valuation markdowns look certain. ""The real money gaming segment faces complete elimination, forcing investors to reassess their entire portfolios in the space. Investors may consider marking down valuations across the gaming sector,"" Aaron Kamath, leader, tech and digital media practice at Nishith Desai Associates told TOI. Initially, most investors will give companies room to adapt but if that proves unviable, write-downs and exits will be inevitable, said Pearl Agarwal, founder and managing partner at Eximius Ventures.Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia India and Southeast Asia), Kalaari Capital, RTP Global and Alpha Wave Global are among investors who have backed RMG firms. Gaming companies like Nazara Technologies also have picked up some stakes in RMG startups. Nitish Mittersain, CEO at Nazara whose stock crashed post the development said that it was too early to take a call on writing off its investment in PokerBaazi but the firm will do ""whatever accounting standards apply.Between 2020-2024, investors have collectively pumped in $696 million into RMG startups, data sourced from Tracxn showed.The ban which is a step closer to being implemented after Parliament cleared the Online Gaming Bill, has set off a series of legal consultations and deliberations in the broader VC and startup ecosystem. In fact, legal challenges are already underway with industry bodies representing major platforms preparing coordinated constitutional challenges before the judiciary, arguing ""the blanket ban is arbitrary and disproportionate"", Kamath said.Considering the Bill has flagged that online gaming services are linked to serious unlawful activities such as financing of terrorism and posing threat to national security, it will be tricky to see how the Supreme Court views this development, said Surbhi Kejriwal, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The broader investment has taken a hit with some experts saying that the move doesn't align with the govt's push for ease of doing business. ""Sudden blanket bans don't inspire a lot of confidence amongst global technology investors who are otherwise bullish on India but struggle to factor in regulatory risk in their investments....ironically, we also have a $30 billion lottery market, a state subject,"" said Nitin Sharma, partner at Singapore-based VC firm Antler India. It unsettles domestic and international investors to have the policy changed on the fly, added Ranjeet Shetye, venture partner at YourNest. Such a drastic shift signals to investors that the Govt can arbitrarily dismantle a thriving sector, creating significant regulatory risk, said Probir Roy Chowdhury, partner at JSA Advocates & Solicitors.RMG startups will have to pivot to e-sports and social gaming, relocating operations to jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks, said experts. ""Some large-scale gaming companies are considering diversifying and exploring alternative revenue channels such as offline or casino businesses in permitted territories,"" said Kejriwal.","The sweeping ban on online real-money gaming has put investments at risk.

MUMBAI: Will Mediclaim and life covers get cheaper by 18% if GST is waived on health and life insurance? Not quite, say industry and researchers.The 18% that customers currently pay helps insurers use the input tax credit (ITC) they receive on various goods and services they utilise. With zero GST tax, an inverted structure is created ,with unutilised ITC eating into insurers' margins.Broadly, insurers have welcomed the move to make health insurance cheaper. ""Lower taxation will directly make health insurance more affordable, particularly for middle-class households, rural populations and small enterprises that often perceive premiums as a financial burden,"" said Rakesh Jain, CEO, Reliance General Insurance. He, however, pointed to the inverted duty structure.""This mismatch increases operational costs and creates financial inefficiencies, limiting the overall benefit of a GST reduction. Unless this anomaly is addressed, insurers may continue to face pressure on margins even as customers gain from lower premiums. For sustainable growth, tax reforms must be complemented with rationalisation of processes and policies that ease working capital management,"" he said.Research houses are unclear on the impact of the GST waiver on the insurance industry. ""If ITC can't be availed when GST is scrapped, insurance companies will have to hike prices by 6-10%. That will defeat the purpose of reducing GST, which is to lower eventual prices for the end consumer, spur demand, and improve penetration,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, a managing director with Macquarie Capital. According to Ganapathy, the revenue-neutral rate for insurance companies is around 12% - a slab the govt proposes to eliminate. The other option was to move to 5%, which GoM has decided against.","The 18% that customers currently pay helps insurers use the input tax credit (ITC) They receive on various goods and services they utilise.

He stated that large companies failed to self-regulate and take ""good and effective steps to prevent harm"" to society, even as the common public lost money, prompting individuals and families to commit suicides.""We observed instances of money laundering as well as terror support. And that's why we kept it. Also, the way this (real-money) addiction was growing, this would have caused serious harm to society... Many suicides happened practically across every part of the country. We saw news of families committing suicides because of losses they made in online money games. This was clearly visible to the industry also. If they took good and effective steps to prevent the harm, obviously things would have been different,"" the minister told TOI on a day Parliament cleared 'The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025' that bans money games in India.On statements given by the industry that their operations would collapse, Vaishnaw said there will be orderly growth after a clear regulatory mandate.""The gaming industry will continue to grow... E-sports and online social gaming will be promoted as a part of this bill. The online money game is what is getting regulated. The game makers will get new opportunities and the gaming industry will continue to grow for the parts, which are beneficial to society. The social games include Sudoku and the online social games include chess. There are so many games which are part of our life, and promoting those is part of this.""The minister said there was unanimity across party lines to take action against money games. ""Practically every MP from every party or every society, every state has been asking for strict action on this. People from across the spectrum, whichever party, whichever state, whichever language, have been asking for action on it because it's visible in society today.""Asked whether it was a political decision then, he said, ""The harm to society is very real. Vaishnaw said the industry was clearly aware of the issues but did not take remedial measures. ""We engaged with the industry for more than three years. Attempts were made to make the industry understand the harms. And, the industry is certainly getting the feedback from society also.""Asked about loss of investments and FDI in a sector, which was seen as a sunrise industry till just a few years back, he said money will continue to come in. ""Gaming as an activity, which is part of e-sports and part of online social games will continue to grow. Investments will come in those segments. The bill also has a provision for creating an authority to promote online social games and e-sports.""He said the IT ministry will keep a tab on potential job losses in the industry, even as they expect employment to grow. ""Game makers will get many more opportunities to create new games in e-sports and online social game segments. They will get newer opportunities because we are actively promoting that.""Regarding the menace of offshore illegal games, the minister said the new law will tackle their growth. ""We are continuously taking enforcement action against illegal offshore apps and are continuously blocking them.

Gold prices may scale another record by the end of this year, with Comex futures projected to hit $3,600 per ounce, according to Ventura Securities. The brokerage attributed the rally to global economic headwinds, geopolitical risks and robust investment demand, as reported by PTI.“With inflationary pressures, a softening US dollar, and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, we see sustained upside potential in gold prices through the remainder of 2025. … indicates Comex gold could test the USD 3,600 mark by year-end, supported by strong ETF inflows, steady central bank buying, and robust retail participation in India’s gold investment market,"" said NS Ramaswamy, Head of Commodities at Ventura.Comex gold futures recently touched an all-time high of $3,534.10 on August 7. Domestically, October gold futures hit a record Rs 1,02,250 per 10 grams on the Multi Commodity Exchange a day later.“Gold retains upside potential with pronounced volatility, supported by weaker US growth, sustained pressure on the US dollar index, trade frictions and heightened geopolitical risks,” Ventura noted in its outlook.Global gold demand rose 3 per cent year-on-year to 1,249 tonnes in the second quarter, valued at $132 billion, marking a 45 per cent surge in value terms.Investment flows via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been particularly strong, with global ETF holdings up 16 per cent to 3,616 tonnes by June 30. Assets under management jumped 64 per cent year-on-year to USD 383 billion.India is following this trend, with domestic gold ETFs seeing a 42 per cent increase in holdings to 66.68 tonnes by June 30. Assets under management nearly doubled to Rs 64,777 crore, while investor accounts surged 41 per cent to 76.54 lakh, marking a 317 per cent rise over four years.Ventura highlighted a shift in investor preferences: younger buyers are increasingly opting for ETFs, fractional ownership, and digital gold platforms. “Over the past 20 years, gold has delivered positive annual returns in 14 calendar years, reinforcing its status as a proven store of value and a hedge against inflation,” the firm said. “Recent performance underscores its resilience, with average annual returns of 23 per cent over the last three years compared to 11 per cent for the Nifty 50 index,"" it added.Central banks remain steady buyers of gold, Ventura added. With the Reserve Bank of India halting new issuances of Sovereign Gold Bonds since February 2024, ETFs and digital instruments are expected to capture a bigger share of investment demand.","Comex gold futures recently touched an all-time high of $3,534.10 on August 7.

They are dealing with the vast range of goods traded between the two economies in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, involving $2 trillion in annual trans-Atlantic business.The 3 1/2-page text represents a political commitment and is not legally binding. It contrasts with the typical format for trade agreements, which can be hundreds of pages long and carry legal force.The key provisions are the 15% tariff on most EU goods, a zero rate on U.S. cars and other industrial goods exported to the 27-member EU, and a range of exceptions to the 15% rate for aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, with other sectors to be added for goods crucial to each other's economies. Those goods would face lower tariffs from before President Donald Trump's tariff onslaught.""The EU has agreed to open its $20 Trillion market,"" Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said on X. ""The second largest in the world behind the great USA.""He said the deal was ""a major win for American workers, US industries, and our national security. Tariffs should be one of America's favorite words.""European officials have had to defend the deal against dismay from businesses and member governments at the higher tariffs and criticism that the EU gave away too much. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sold the deal as granting quick relief from the even higher U.S. tariff on EU cars of 27.5% and as opening the way for further negotiations that could exclude more goods from the 15% tariffs. The deal provides that the lower tariff on cars would apply retroactively from Aug. 1 if the EU can introduce legislation to implement its part of the deal by then, which EU officials say they will do.""Faced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our member states and industry and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is not the end of the process.""The chief EU trade negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, echoed those sentiments. ""The alternative was a trade war with sky high tariffs ... it builds confidence. It brings stability,"" he said.Economists say higher tariffs slow economic growth and will be reflected in higher consumer prices.One category of goods not excluded from tariffs on EU goods was wine and spirits, which had enjoyed zero tariffs on both ends since a 1997 trade deal. Sefcovic, said EU officials had not won an exemption ""yet"" but hoped to in future talks and that ""doors are not closed forever"" on that issue.That means American distillers face zero tariffs in Europe the short term, but also the possibility of EU retaliation down the line, said Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. ""Without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits, American distillers do not have the certainty to plan for future export and job growth without the fear of retaliatory tariffs returning,"" Swonger said in a statement.The EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs on US goods including wine and spirits until Feb. 5, 2026.Proposals to exempt a certain amount of EU steel imports, known as a tariff rate quota, have been left unresolved pending more talks.The 15% tariff is much higher than tariff levels on both sides from before Trump began imposing his tariffs, when they averaged in the low single digits. The tariffs are paid on the U.S. end, either absorbed by American businesses importing the goods, lowering their profits, or passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices at the cash register.The deal also includes nonbinding EU commitments to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and for EU companies to invest $600 billion in the U.S. In both cases, the money would come from private companies and is based on assessment by the European Commission on what companies were planning to spend.",The deal imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States.

Tariffs aren't keeping Walmart from attracting shoppers and outpacing Target,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariffs-arent-keeping-walmart-from-attracting-shoppers-and-outpacing-target/articleshow/123437135.cms,"FILE - Shoppers walk from the Walmart store, Aug. 14, 2025, in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, file)

NEW YORK: Walmart Inc. powered through an uncertain economic environment and tariff concerns to deliver solid second-quarter financial results Thursday, showing it keeps pulling in shoppers and outpacing peers like Target.The nation's largest retailer reported a 4.6% quarterly increase in comparable sales - those coming from established stores and online channels. Company executives said Walmart was attracting customers, particularly higher-income shoppers who may have avoided its stores in the past, with fast deliveries, grocery discounts and trendier clothes.The company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, also raised its annual profit and sales outlook.Walmart's results differed notably from those of rival Target, which on Wednesday reported another quarter of comparable sales declines. The Minneapolis-based company has struggled to find its footing as customers defect to Walmart and other stores where they think they will find greater bargains and increasingly, the same or better merchandise.Target's board of directors named a 20-year company veteran on Wednesday to succeed CEO Brian Cornell when he steps down after 11 years in early 2026.Walmart said its profitable e-commerce operations, advertising revenue and selection of products with high profit margins have given it flexibility to absorb extra costs from the range of tariffs President Donald Trump has put on foreign products.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors Thursday that the impact of tariffs also has been gradual enough to mute changes in consumer spending behavior. When the discounter raised prices on certain items, it's observed lower- and middle-income customers trading down to lower-priced options or foregoing purchases, he said.The company will continue to see its costs increase as it replenishes inventory at post-tariff price levels, McMillion said.""We're doing what we said we would do,"" he said. ""We're keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.""A growing list of companies, including Procter & Gamble, E.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren, told investors in recent weeks that they planned to or already had raised prices because of tariffs, though modestly.None of that has derailed consumer spending. Shoppers spent at a healthy pace in July, particularly at the nation's auto dealerships, as signs emerged that President Donald Trump's trade policies were taking a toll on jobs.Some of that spending may have been shoppers buying furniture and other imported items to get ahead of expected price increases, analysts said.On Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement retailer, reported improved sales during its latest quarter as consumers remained focused on smaller projects. Like Walmart, Home Depot's performance missed Wall Street's expectations.The Atlanta-based company also said shoppers should expect modest price increases in some categories as a result of additional costs from tariffs, which are taxes on imports. Home Depot reported comparable sales increase of 1.4% in line with what home improvement rival Lowe's reported on Wednesday.But it's Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in American retailing. The company maintains that 90% of US households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.Walmart said in May that prices had started to increase in late April and got higher in May. But it said Thursday that it had introduced 7,400 price rollbacks, or temporary discounts, across the aisles in the latest quarter.The company said it earned $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended July 31. That compares with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago.Sales rose nearly 5% to $177.4 billion. Walmart's 4.6% growth in US comparable sales during the second quarter was slightly higher than its first-quarter gain of 4.5%. Groceries and health and wellness items fueled the growth, the company said.Global e-commerce sales rose 25%, above the 22% growth in the first quarter.The retailer said roughly one-third of deliveries from its US stores in recent weeks were orders requesting delivery in three hours or less, and 20% of those orders made it to customers in a half-hour or under.Despite Walmart's solid quarter, its stock price was down close to 5% late Thursday morning as its earnings per share came in below what analysts had expected. Analysts were expecting 73 cents per share on sales of $175.93 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet.Per share results, excluding effects of charges related to certain legal matters and from business restructuring, was 68 cents, Walmart said.One $450 million expense was tied to settlements over worker and shopper injury claims, Walmart said. A company spokesperson said the cost per claim was increasing but not the total number.For the year, Walmart raised its per-share estimates to a range of $2.52 to $2.62, up from a previous estimate of $2.50 to $2.60. It said 2025 sales are anticipated to increase 3.75% to 4.75%, more than it projected in May.","The nation's largest retailer reported a 4.6% quarterly increase in comparable sales - those coming from established stores and online channels.

Markets watch as Powell holds ground

Why

Fed independence

matters

Trump’s pressure campaign

How much control presidents really have

Powell’s balancing act

The battle over the independence of the US Federal Reserve has intensified, with President Donald Trump openly calling for the resignation of a governor, threatening to fire Chair Jerome Powell, and repeatedly pressuring the central bank to cut interest rates. The escalating confrontation has revived a long-running debate over why the Fed has historically been insulated from direct White House influence — and why markets, economists, and past experience suggest that independence is critical.This week, Trump demanded that Fed governor Lisa Cook step down after a mortgage fraud allegation, which she has flatly denied, saying she would not be “bullied” into leaving her post. The move came just ahead of Powell’s much-watched speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, his last as chair before his term ends in May 2026.The Fed, which sets interest rates and manages the world’s largest economy’s monetary policy, has long been one of Washington’s few independent power centers, AP reported. But Trump has repeatedly railed against Powell for refusing to cut borrowing costs, arguing that high interest rates are slowing growth and raising the government’s debt-servicing bill.At one point, the president even accused Powell of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters, an allegation that economists dismissed as political theatre.For Wall Street, Powell’s stance matters. The Fed has kept its benchmark rate at 4.3% for five straight meetings, a level meant to tame inflation but one that also keeps mortgages, auto loans, and business borrowing expensive. Powell has said the central bank needs more time to assess the impact of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on inflation and growth.But the economic picture has grown murkier. July’s jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring, casting doubt on Powell’s earlier description of the labour market as “solid.” Inflation, meanwhile, ticked higher in July, with core prices rising 3.1% from a year ago — above the Fed’s 2% target. That leaves Powell trapped between sluggish employment that argues for a rate cut and stubborn inflation that argues against it.Most economists expect Powell to hint at a possible cut later this year without committing to one in September, disappointing investors who have priced in an earlier move. “The dilemma that the Fed is in has become, if anything, more intense,” said David Wilcox, former Fed economist and now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.The stakes go beyond one rate decision. Economists warn that allowing a president to dictate monetary policy could undermine confidence in US markets, push up government borrowing costs, and stoke inflation. The Fed’s credibility rests on its ability to make unpopular decisions when necessary, such as raising rates even when politicians want easy money.That lesson was seared into economic memory in the 1970s, when then-Fed Chair Arthur Burns, under pressure from President Richard Nixon, kept rates low heading into the 1972 election. Inflation spiralled, and the US endured years of economic pain. It took Paul Volcker, appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, to impose brutally high rates of nearly 20% — triggering a deep recession but ultimately taming runaway prices. Volcker’s defiance is now seen as a defining example of why central banks must stand apart from day-to-day politics.Trump has made little secret of his frustration with Powell. He has accused him of mishandling inflation, mismanaging Fed operations, and blocking growth. At a recent tour of the Fed’s renovation project, Trump tried to publicly embarrass Powell by claiming costs had soared to $3.1 trillion, a figure Powell calmly dismissed as including unrelated expenses.The president’s attacks are unusual in their intensity, though not unprecedented. Past presidents, from Lyndon Johnson to Ronald Reagan, have privately leaned on Fed chiefs. What sets Trump apart is his willingness to air those grievances in public and to threaten removal of officials whose terms are protected by law.Legal experts say the president cannot fire a Fed chair simply for policy disagreements. The Supreme Court has signaled that removal would require “cause” — such as misconduct or negligence. That may explain why Trump has focused on the renovation controversy as a potential pretext. Still, any attempt to oust Powell would likely spark a court battle and roil global markets.Despite its independence, the Fed is not unaccountable. The president appoints all seven members of its governing board, subject to Senate confirmation, and over time can reshape policy direction. Trump will get his chance when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.Congress also has a role: in 1977, it gave the Fed its “dual mandate” to pursue stable prices and maximum employment. The chair must testify before lawmakers twice a year, offering public explanations of the Fed’s decisions.For now, however, Powell and his colleagues retain their votes on interest-rate policy. Even if Trump replaced Powell tomorrow, the 12-member rate-setting committee could still resist political pressure. That is precisely why markets prize Fed independence: it makes decisions more predictable, less politicized, and more credible.As Powell prepares to deliver his Jackson Hole speech, he faces one of the most delicate balancing acts of his career. The Fed must decide whether to prioritize cooling inflation, which risks choking growth, or cutting rates to cushion a slowing economy, which risks igniting prices.Either way, his words will be parsed by investors, politicians, and global markets alike. For Trump, the stakes are political; for Powell, institutional. For the Fed, it is about preserving a legacy of independence that, economists say, has safeguarded US stability for decades.","Trump has repeatedly railed against Powell for refusing to cut borrowing costs.

"US housing market trend: Home sales rise in July as mortgage rates ease, inventory hits 5-year high",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-housing-market-trend-home-sales-rise-in-july-as-mortgage-rates-ease-inventory-hits-five-year-high/articleshow/123434937.cms,"Sales of previously occupied US homes registered an uptick in July, aided by a modest decline in mortgage rates, slower home price growth and the largest supply of properties on the market in five years.According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing home sales rose 2% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. That figure also represented a 0.8% increase compared with July last year, surpassing economists’ expectations of a 3.92 million pace, data from FactSet showed, reported AP.Home prices continued their upward run for the 25th straight month, but the rate of growth slowed considerably. The national median sales price inched up just 0.2% year-on-year to $422,400. “The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices.”The US housing market has struggled since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows, leading to the lowest sales level in nearly three decades last year.The 2024 spring homebuying season, traditionally the busiest for real estate, failed to pick up momentum as high mortgage rates deterred many prospective buyers.The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained high this year, though it dropped to a 10-month low of 6.58% last week. Many of July’s purchases were likely contracted in May and June, when rates ranged from 6.76% to 6.89%. In July, mortgage rates eased further, briefly touching 6.67%.The slowdown in sales has coincided with an increase in unsold homes. NAR data showed 1.55 million unsold properties at the end of July, up 0.6% from June and 15.7% from July last year — the highest in five years, though still short of the pre-pandemic norm of around 2 million homes. “Now, with more inventory buyers (are) in a much better position to negotiate for better prices,” Yun noted.At the current sales pace, July’s inventory represents a 4.6-month supply, down slightly from 4.7 months in June but above the 4-month supply recorded last year. A balanced market between buyers and sellers is typically seen at 5-6 months of supply.Properties are also taking longer to close. Homes remained on the market for an average of 28 days in July, compared with 24 days in the same month a year ago, NAR said.","Existing home sales rose 2% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units.

The report said Chinese officials have already begun assessing the aircraft requirements of domestic carriers.Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has used tariffs as leverage against key US trading partners, arguing that deficits reflect unfair practices. Purchases from Boeing, the nation’s largest manufacturing exporter, have often featured in Trump’s trade negotiations to balance imbalances.In July, the White House announced that Japan had committed to buy 100 Boeing aircraft and Indonesia 50 as part of broader trade understandings aimed at avoiding higher tariffs.China, however, has been the main target of Trump’s trade overhaul. Both countries imposed steep tariffs on each other’s products this year, including restrictions that temporarily halted Boeing deliveries. The two sides agreed in May to roll back duties temporarily, later extending the suspension by 90 days as talks continue.China’s last large Boeing order came in November 2017 during Trump’s state visit, when Beijing agreed to purchase 300 planes worth more than $37 billion.Boeing, meanwhile, is trying to regain footing after years of setbacks. In July, the company reported a narrower second-quarter loss and its highest delivery tally since 2018. But its reputation remains clouded by safety and quality control concerns, including a near-catastrophic fuselage blowout on a 737 MAX in January 2024, which came after two fatal crashes of the same aircraft type in 2018 and 2019.",Boeing shares rose as much as 3.7% in pre-market trading before settling with gains of less than 1% about 15 minutes into Tuesday’s session.

The retail giant reported solid revenue growth and raised its full-year profit guidance, but expectations had been high going into the earnings release. The Arkansas-based company’s stock had already gained 13.5% this year, well above the broader market.Investors continued to scrutinise Big Tech valuations, questioning whether stock prices had risen too far on artificial intelligence excitement.

On the upside, Nordson rose 7.4% after both profit and revenue for the quarter topped forecasts.In the bond market, Treasury yields edged higher even as fresh data pointed to economic softness. Weekly jobless claims rose, hinting at potential layoffs, while a mid-Atlantic manufacturing survey showed contraction. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up to 4.30% from 4.29%, and the two-year yield rose to 3.75% from 3.74%.Wall Street continues to expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates in September, which would be its first move this year. A rate cut could support growth by lowering borrowing costs for homes, cars, and business investment, though it risks fuelling inflation.

"US-EU transatlantic trade deal: 15% tariff imposed on most EU goods, pharma and aircraft exempted while wine and spirits remain in limbo",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-eu-transatlantic-trade-deal-15-tariff-imposed-on-most-eu-goods-pharma-and-aircraft-exempted-while-wine-and-spirits-remain-in-limbo/articleshow/123434157.cms,"File photo (AP)

The US and European Union officials on Thursday announced a written framework for their long-discussed trade deal, laying down a 15% tariff on 70% of EU exports to the US while leaving several critical sectors unresolved.The agreement, made public as a 3½-page text, was described by both sides as a political commitment rather than a legally binding treaty, AP reported.The document, far shorter than typical trade accords that often run into hundreds of pages, sets out limited but significant provisions. These include a 15% import tax on most European goods, a zero tariff on US cars and other industrial exports to Europe, and exemptions for aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients. Exemptions for other sectors deemed essential to both economies are expected in later stages.Wine and spirits, which had enjoyed zero tariffs since 1997, were left out of the exemptions and remain subject to the new levy. EU chief trade negotiator Maros Sefcovic admitted the bloc had not yet secured relief in that area but stressed that “doors are not closed forever” and that further talks would continue. Proposals to carve out tariff rate quotas for EU steel were also left pending.The Associated Press reported that European officials described the pact as only a “first step in a process that can be further expanded.”The 15% tariff marks a sharp increase from pre-Trump trade levels, when duties averaged in the low single digits. The costs, collected on the US side, could either be absorbed by American importers or passed on to consumers through higher prices. Some EU businesses and member governments have voiced unease, warning that Brussels conceded too much.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the agreement, framing it as a safeguard against Trump’s threatened 27.5% tariff on EU car exports. She said the deal provides “quick relief” and opens a path for exemptions in additional sectors. “Faced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our member states and industry and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade,” she said. “This is not the end of the process.”Sefcovic echoed her view, noting that the alternative was “a trade war with sky high tariffs.” He added, “It builds confidence. It brings stability.”Beyond tariffs, the pact also includes nonbinding EU commitments to purchase $750 billion worth of US energy and for EU companies to invest $600 billion in the American economy, based on projections compiled by the European Commission. Both sides acknowledged that implementation would hinge on follow-up negotiations in the months ahead.",US and European Union officials announce written framework for their long- discussed trade deal.

China stablecoin shift: Beijing mulls yuan-backed tokens to push global adoption; plans major policy reversal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-stablecoin-shift-beijing-mulls-yuan-backed-tokens-to-push-global-adoption-plans-major-policy-reversal/articleshow/123430235.cms,"China is considering allowing the usage of yuan-backed stablecoins for the first time in a move aimed at boosting the global adoption of its currency, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. If approved, the plan would mark a significant reversal of China’s earlier hardline stance against digital assets.According to the sources, the State Council — China’s cabinet — will review and possibly approve a roadmap later this month to expand the yuan’s international role, including measures to compete with the US push on stablecoins. The plan is expected to set targets for wider usage of the Chinese currency in global markets, define the responsibilities of regulators, and establish guidelines for risk prevention.The country’s top leadership is also expected to convene for a study session as early as the end of this month, focusing on yuan internationalisation and stablecoins. At the meeting, senior leaders are likely to outline remarks that will set the tone for stablecoin adoption and define the boundaries of its development in business, one source said.Stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency pegged to fiat currencies like the dollar, are widely used to move funds between tokens and for cross-border transactions.China banned cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021, citing risks to financial stability, but officials now see yuan-backed stablecoins as a tool for promoting financial innovation and strengthening the yuan’s global role.China has long aspired for the yuan to achieve global currency status on par with the dollar or euro, but tight capital controls and its large trade surpluses have held back progress. Market participants say those restrictions will remain a hurdle for the development of stablecoins as well.The yuan’s share in global payments fell to 2.88% in June, its lowest in two years, according to SWIFT data, while the US dollar accounted for 47.19%. In contrast, US President Donald Trump has backed stablecoins since January and is establishing a regulatory framework to legitimise dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies.Sources told Reuters China’s roadmap will assign implementation duties to regulators, including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). Hong Kong and Shanghai are expected to fast-track local rollouts, with Hong Kong’s new stablecoin ordinance, effective August 1, already positioning the territory as one of the first jurisdictions to regulate fiat-backed issuers. Shanghai is also building an international operations hub for the digital yuan.China’s next steps could be unveiled at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin from Aug. 31-Sep. 1, where Beijing may discuss expanding the use of yuan and stablecoins for cross-border trade and payments, said the sources.Globally, stablecoins backed by the dollar dominate the market, making up more than 99% of supply, according to the Bank for International Settlements. South Korea and Japan are also advancing plans for won- and yen-based stablecoins. The global stablecoin market is valued at $247 billion, but Standard Chartered Bank estimates it could reach $2 trillion by 2028.","If approved, the plan would mark a significant reversal of China’s earlier hardline stance against digital assets.

Donald Trump’s investments: Where is the US President putting over $100 million? Family not 'directly involved',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-investments-where-is-the-us-president-putting-over-100-million-family-not-directly-involved-bonds/articleshow/123429585.cms,"Since returning to the White House in January 2025, US President Donald Trump’s financial choices have drawn attention, with many questioning how he is investing his money. New disclosures released by the US Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday (local time) reveal that Trump has put more than $100 million into bonds.The filings, reported by Al Jazeera, offer a look into how the businessman-turned-president is managing his wealth while in office.The documents, covering the period from Trump’s inauguration on January 21 to August 1, reveal nearly 700 separate bond purchases. These include stakes in major financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, alongside investments in corporate giants including Meta, T-Mobile, UnitedHealth and The Home Depot.Trump has also channelled money into a wide range of municipal bonds across several US states, among them New York, Florida and Texas. These bonds help fund public infrastructure projects ranging from hospitals and schools to airports, ports and gas development schemes, ANI stated citing reports.While the disclosures do not specify exact amounts for each transaction, they categorise the investments into broad ranges, from $100,001 to $250,000, and in some cases as high as $1 million to $5 million.The filings, however, did not list any asset sales during the corresponding period.Bonds are a type of fixed-income investment, effectively loans to corporations or public authorities in return for interest payments over time.Under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, introduced in the wake of the Watergate scandal, American presidents are required to make their finances public, though they are not legally obliged to sell assets that could create conflicts of interest.Most presidents since then have chosen to either put their assets in blind trusts or restrict investments to diversified mutual funds, steps aimed at avoiding ethical controversies.Trump, however, opted to transfer his business interests into a trust run by his children, a decision that has drawn criticism from ethics experts. US media reports, cited by Al Jazeera, showed that Trump and his family were not directly involved in the transactions.As for his salary as the POTUS, Trump may earn more than $600,000, which he said would be donated entirely, repeating the pledge he had made during his first term.","New disclosures released by the US Office of Government Ethics reveal that Trump has put more than $100 million into bonds.

'Looking for a fresh pair of eyes': Target CEO Brian Cornell to step down; COO Michael Fiddelke named successor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/looking-for-a-fresh-pair-of-eyes-target-ceo-brian-cornell-to-step-down-coo-michael-fiddelke-named-successor/articleshow/123427905.cms,"US retail giant Target said on Wednesday that chief executive officer Brian Cornell will step down on February 1, ending his nearly decade-long tenure at the retailer. The board has named chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke, who has spent 20 years with the company, as his successor.The leadership change comes as the Minneapolis-based chain struggles with declining sales and pressure to restore its reputation for offering affordable yet stylish merchandise. Target operates around 1,980 stores across the United States.Fiddelke, who joined Target in 2004 and has held roles in finance, merchandising and operations, was elevated to COO in 2023. His promotion to CEO surprised some industry analysts, who expected the board to bring in an external candidate to tackle the company’s prolonged challenges.“The Street was looking for a fresh pair of eyes that might bring a solution to two years of stumbles,” Stacey Widlitz, president of investment research firm SW Retail Advisors adding that investors should give Fiddelke a chance.Target’s shares dropped more than 8 per cent in early trading after the announcement, alongside another disappointing quarterly sales report. Additionally, it recorded flat or declining comparable sales in nine of the past 11 quarters.On Wednesday, the retailer reported a 1.9 per cent drop in comparable sales for its latest three-month period, with net income falling 21 per cent.In March, company executives told investors they aimed to revive Target’s reputation for affordable yet stylish merchandise by expanding its portfolio of private-label brands and speeding up the process of bringing new products from concept to shelves.The retailer has struggled since inflation pushed consumers to cut back on discretionary spending, while shoppers have also complained about cluttered stores and merchandise that fell short of the “Tarzhay” image of chic but affordable products.The situation was compounded earlier this year by consumer boycotts after Target, along with Walmart and other major US companies, scaled back diversity, equity and inclusion programmes.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Fiddelke acknowledged missteps during the pandemic when the company overemphasised essential household goods while demand for home furnishings peaked, as quoted by Associated Press. He outlined three immediate priorities as incoming CEO: re-establishing Target’s leadership in merchandise selection and presentation; improving the in-store experience through cleaner environments and consistent stock; and boosting investment in technology.“When we’re leading with swagger in our merchandising authority, when we have swagger in our marketing and we’re setting the trend for retail, those are some of the moments I think that Target has been at its highest in my 20 years,” Fiddelke said.","US retail giant Target said on Wednesday that chief executive officer Brian Cornell will step down on February 1.

'Greater of the two risks': Inflation overshadows employment at Fed policy meeting; minutes reveal divisions over Trump’s tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/greater-of-the-two-risks-inflation-overshadows-employment-at-fed-policy-meeting-minutes-reveal-divisions-over-trumps-tariffs/articleshow/123421041.cms,"Federal Reserve building

Minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s late July policy meeting revealed that a majority of officials viewed upside inflation risks as more significant than employment concerns, highlighting internal disagreements over the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs.""A majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two,"" the report said, as quoted by the Associated Press, adding that, "" a couple of participants considered downside risk to employment the more salient"" one.The minutes reflected divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee, with dissenting votes from Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in July. Despite Trump’s repeated calls for rate cuts, policymakers kept interest rates at 4.25–4.50 percent. Waller and Bowman supported a 25 basis point reduction, with Bowman citing concerns about economic weakening and ""the risk of damage to the labor market. ""Wednesday’s released minutes noted that while two officials preferred lower rates, the dissenters appeared isolated. They believed tariffs would not have a persistent effect on prices but remained concerned about labor market conditions.Economic activity growth slowed during the first half of 2023, with tariff impacts ""becoming more apparent in the data, as indicated by recent increases in goods price inflation.""Several officials warned that inflation has persistently exceeded the Fed’s two-percent target, raising concerns about long-term expectations, particularly if tariffs continue to affect prices. Participants also noted that the full impact of higher duties on consumer costs could take time to show.Oxford Economics economist Ryan Sweet said, ""The labour market will be the swing factor on whether the Fed cuts interest rates in September or not."" He added, ""It's likely the August employment report and revisions will be the determining factor."" Sweet noted that ""odds are rising that the Fed cuts sooner than we anticipate.""In another development, the ongoing tensions escalated between Trump and the Federal Reserve, with the US President publicly demanding the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This call comes amid his persistent criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates.Trump took to his Truth Social platform to express his demand, citing a Bloomberg report that highlighted concerns raised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency's director regarding Cook's mortgage dealings. The director, Bill Pulte, a known Trump supporter, reportedly urged the US attorney general to investigate Cook, suggesting potential criminal activity.Cook responded to the allegations, stating she first learned of them through social media. She clarified that the mortgage in question was obtained before her tenure at the Federal Reserve. In a statement to AFP, Cook said, ""I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,"" However, she acknowledged the importance of addressing questions about her financial history and is working to provide accurate information.The Trump administration has a history of pursuing mortgage fraud allegations against prominent Democrats, often seen as political rivals. It remains uncertain whether an official investigation into Cook will be initiated, as she is the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve's board.The president's power to remove central bank officials is limited. A recent Supreme Court ruling indicates that Fed officials cannot be dismissed over policy disagreements, requiring a ""cause"" for removal, which typically involves evidence of wrongdoing.","Minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s late July policy meeting revealed that a majority of officials viewed upside inflation risks as more significant than employment concerns.

Palantir Technologies tumbled 4.7% to add to its 9.4% loss from the previous day. Both stocks have soared this year but are now facing investor concerns that valuations ran too high too quickly. Nvidia shares are up 35.5% year-to-date, while Palantir has more than doubled.Analysts pointed to mounting caution around AI bets. A study by MIT’s Nanda Initiative suggested most corporations are not yet seeing measurable returns from generative AI investments. Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the report may have added to the selling pressure.“Companies like Nvidia are still seen as the backbone of the AI revolution, but investors are asking whether the near-term payoff justifies the surge in valuations,” Hoffmann-Burchardi noted.Mixed earnings from retailers added to the uneven sentiment. TJX, the operator of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, gained 3.4% after beating Wall Street’s profit and revenue forecasts and raising its full-year outlook. CEO Ernie Herrman said the company is seeing “strong demand at each of our U.S. and international businesses” and reported a strong start to the current quarter.Lowe’s rose 0.2% after reporting better-than-expected profit and announcing an $8.8 billion deal to acquire Foundation Building Materials, a drywall and ceiling systems distributor. Target, however, slumped 8% after announcing CEO Brian Cornell would step down on February 1, with longtime executive Michael Fiddelke set to succeed him. Estee Lauder shed 5.2% on a weaker-than-expected profit forecast, citing tariffs that could shave about $100 million off annual earnings. La-Z-Boy plunged 13.2% after missing profit and revenue estimates.Investors are now turning their focus to Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, a forum that has historically hosted major Fed policy signals. Wall Street is hoping for hints of interest-rate cuts as the central bank holds rates steady amid concerns that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could stoke inflation. A weak jobs report earlier this month has shifted expectations toward rate easing.Treasury yields continued to fall, with the 10-year yield easing to 4.28% from 4.30% late Tuesday.Overseas, markets were mixed. London’s FTSE 100 rose 1.2% despite data showing UK inflation rose faster than expected in July, driven by higher airfares and food prices. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.5% after exports slipped more than expected under the weight of US tariffs.

China had tightened export approvals as retaliation against US tariffs, a move that disrupted global supply chains.Exports slumped sharply in April and May due to long approval processes for securing licences, a bottleneck that left some automakers outside China facing production halts amid shortages of rare earths.Germany retained its position as the top export destination in July, with shipments rising 46% from the previous month to 1,116 tons.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

'Pharma companies need to look beyond US market',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pharma-companies-need-to-look-beyond-us-market/articleshow/120187344.cms,"HYDERABAD: With the Trump administration's flip-flops on tariffs giving the Indian pharma industry a headache, experts feel it's time the sector looked at an 'America plus' strategy to reduce heavy dependence on US consumers and explore other markets to derisk business.The US market dominates India's pharma exports, accounting for over 30% ($9 billion) of the total $28 billion in FY24, while the European Union stands as the second-largest market at around $4 billion. ""The industry was relieved when Trump did not announce any tariff earlier and put a 90-day pause on tariffs after earlier stating his intention to impose tariffs on pharma, but the situation is still very dicey,"" said an industry source.Many major Indian pharmaceutical companies , including Dr Reddy's, Sun Pharma, and Aurobindo, derive 40-45% of their revenues from the US market, making them particularly vulnerable to any adverse policy changes. Prescribing an 'America Plus' strategy for the Indian pharma sector, former Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil) Director General Ravi Uday Bhaskar said there are significant opportunities in the global generic drug market , which is projected to grow from $430 billion currently to $790 billion by 2030.He advocated market diversification for the Indian pharma sector while maintaining their US presence.""We can't leave the US as 31% of our products go there, but we also need to look at expanding to other geographies. There is a huge opportunity we can tap in Latin America, Africa, and Asean,"" said Bhaskar.

Trump tariffs put pause on startups' IPO plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-tariffs-put-pause-on-startups-ipo-plans/articleshow/120186751.cms,"MUMBAI: The market downturn triggered by Trump tariffs have not only upset startups' IPO plans - pushing timelines by at least one to two quarters - the subdued sentiment has also spilled over to private markets where deals are stuck over valuation concerns.Investors are sitting on enough capital and big private equity (PE) funds are scouting for startup investments, but the correction in public markets have led them to renegotiate valuations, delaying closure of sizable deals, fund managers, investment bankers and consultants told TOI. This means that startups in need of funding will have to settle for lower valuations and those who are raising pre-IPO capital will have to make peace with flat valuations. Even as the US has announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for countries barring China, uncertainty about the global macro environment persists, leading to investor caution.""On an average, funds are yet to deploy 25%-30% of the capital they have raised earlier and also new funds are being raised. But valuations are being negotiated for deals that are in the works. If public markets continue to remain subdued, the first leg of discussions will keep getting delayed.Companies that are in need of urgent capital will have to compromise on valuation multiples,"" said Mehekka Oberoi, fund manager at IIFL Fintech Fund. Investors are back on the table but pricing is a concern, said Amit Ramchandani, CEO and head of investment banking at Motilal Oswal Financial.Had valuations not been an issue, the flow of big funding deals ($100 million and beyond) would have been higher given that private markets are more attractive at this juncture, said Amit Nawka, partner at PwC. ""The market is ripe for growth deals but the question is when will public markets recover? Because public markets have taken a beating, valuations to enter large private deals will be questioned,"" Nawka said. Over the past few months, PE players like KKR and Kedaara Capital have become active in the startup space-earlier this week fintech Juspay bagged $60 million in funding led by Kedaara Capital while KKR bought stake in Rebel Foods through a secondary transaction in Dec. ""While overall India remains attractive for investors and startups, some tempering of valuations could be expected in select mid to growth stage deals and the stringent evaluation by investors will continue,"" said Aditya Shukla, partner at Bain & Company.From a broader perspective, the private markets currently look better and overall funding (including big deals) should pick up pace in the months to come, investors said. ""The IPO window is shut for now and listing activity is poised to be significantly lower this year. Rational valuations in private markets should fuel funding in the unlisted space,"" said Shapath Parikh, co-founder at White Whale Partners.","Investors are sitting on enough capital and big private equity (PE) funds are scouting for startup investments. But the correction in public markets have led them to renegotiate valuations, delaying closure of sizable deals. This means that startups in need of funding will have to settle for lower valuations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120186826,imgsize-655817,width-400,resizemode-4/120186826.jpg"

This is because the pace of policy changes by Trump and the wide range of areas he covered in less than three months, has left most business leaders doubting the stability of decisions by Trump.""Beneath the current euphoria lies a more stubborn truth: Markets may breathe easier in the short term, but the long-term damage to trust is real,"" said Nigel Green, CEO, deVere Group, a London-based global financial advisory. The US markets' trading pattern in Thursday's early trades gave credence to what experts were thinking. In opening trades, rather than building on Wednesday's record-breaking rally, the US market was deep in the red (down 4%).US markets which on Wednesday broke several records - S& jumped 9.5%, the biggest single-day gain since the global financial crisis in 2008-09; Dow Jones Index shot up by 2,900 points, the single-biggest one-day gain ever for one of the world's most tracked indices; and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 12.2%, its biggest single-session jump in nearly a quarter of a century - reversed gains a day later.By mid-session Thursday, Dow was down nearly 1,800 points (4.4%), Nasdaq was down over 1,000 points (6.1%) and S& was trading 280 points (5.2%) in the red.Earlier, during Wednesday's rally, the magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks added $1.5 trillion in just one session, of which $440 billion was by the chip giant Nvidia alone.

Economists, however, warned that the inflation data reflects only the past and provides little reassurance for what lies ahead. There are also growing fears that inflation could accelerate again if tariffs continue to weigh on consumer and business costs.President Donald Trump’s sudden decision to pause a number of tariffs globally triggered Wednesday’s surge, but markets remain cautious. Trump is still pressing ahead with steeper tariffs on Chinese goods—raising them to a punishing 125 per cent. Even a potential negotiation that reduced them to 50 per cent would still pose a major threat to US corporate earnings, UBS strategist Bhanu Baweja cautioned.In response, China has been quietly building alliances with other global players to push back against Washington’s trade stance. The European Union, meanwhile, said on Thursday that it would delay its retaliatory measures for 90 days, signalling hope for a diplomatic resolution.Trump and treasury secretary Scott Bessent issued a pointed message following the tariff pause , “Do not retaliate, and you will be rewarded.”Despite that, market watchers remain on edge. The S&P 500 is still trading below levels seen before Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs last week, and investors are bracing for further volatility.There was a glimmer of relief in the bond market, where conditions appeared to stabilise after days of turbulence. Earlier in the week, a sharp rise in US Treasury yields had unnerved investors. At one point, the 10-year Treasury yield surged to nearly 4.50 per cent, up from 4.01 per cent just days earlier, amid speculation that hedge funds and overseas investors were dumping US debt.Overseas, markets surged in their first session since the tariff pause.

"US inflation cools down despite Trump's trade war, aided by falling gas prices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-cools-down-despite-trumps-trade-war-aided-by-falling-gas-prices/articleshow/120166340.cms,"Inflation in the United States cooled last month as falling petrol, air travel and hotel stay costs, helped ease the financial strain on consumers amid growing concerns over Trump’s tariff war.According to the US labor department, consumer prices rose by 2.4 per cent in March as compared to a year earlier, marking a major drop from February’s 2.8 per cent and the slowest rate of inflation since September.Excluding volatile categories like food and energy costs, core inflation also slowed. Core prices climbed 2.8 per cent year-on-year, down from 3.1 per cent in February, marking the weakest annual gain in nearly four years. Economists consider core inflation a more reliable indicator of long-term price trends.On a monthly basis, overall prices dipped 0.1 per cent, the first monthly decline in almost five years. Core prices edged up just 0.1 per cent from February to March.However, experts were quick to caution against reading too much into the latest figures and said that President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies could soon reverse the trend.“We got a huge tariff increase,” said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth Management.“There was an extreme tariff increase for less than 24 hours, and we’re back to a huge tariff increase, relative to where we were a month ago. This is increasing taxes on US consumers. And they’re going to have to find the money to pay these taxes.”Last week, Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly 60 countries, sparking market volatility and widespread economic uncertainty. Although he announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs this Wednesday, except China. Trump increased the tariff from 84 per cent to 125 per cent on Chinese goods.Economists expect these measures to push inflation higher over the next few months, with elevated prices possibly persisting through the end of the year.Travel-related costs were a major driver behind March’s inflation slowdown. Airfares dropped 5.3 per cent month-on-month, while hotel prices slid 3.5 per cent, reflecting a steep fall in international tourism. Government data showed a 12 per cent decline in overseas visitors to the US last month, which analysts have linked to Trump’s hardline trade approach.Used car prices also dipped by 0.7 per cent, and the cost of car insurance fell 0.8 per cent, offering some relief for motorists. However, insurance premiums remained 7.5 per cent higher than a year ago.Groceries, on the other hand, became more expensive. Food prices jumped 0.5 per cent in March, with eggs surging 5.9 per cent to a record $6.23 per dozen. Clothing costs rose 0.4 per cent, though annual gains remain modest.The uncertainty around trade policy continues to weigh heavily on businesses. Many firms are bracing for higher costs, particularly those reliant on Chinese imports like mobile phones, clothes, shoes, and toys. The US imports over $60 billion worth of mobile phones annually from China alone.While some American companies have begun shifting production away from China, these transitions take time and could drive up costs further.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the fragile outlook, stating last week that interest rates would likely remain steady at around 4.3 per cent as the central bank monitors the situation.“There’s a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us,” Powell said. “And that just seems like the right thing to do in this period of uncertainty.”President Trump, meanwhile, called on the Fed to cut interest rates on Friday, adding to the ongoing tension between the White House and the central bank.","Consumer prices rose by 2.4 per cent in March as compared to a year earlier.

Contrasting worlds collide

Aiming for a renaissance

Turning the tables on France

NEW DELHI: Italian powerhouse Prada announced Thursday it will acquire flamboyant rival Versace from US-based Capri Holdings in a €1.25 billion (over Rs 12,000 crore) deal, a move poised to reshape the balance of power in high fashion.The deal, set to close in the second half of 2025, creates an Italian luxury giant with revenues exceeding €6 billion — a bold challenge to French behemoths like LVMH and Kering, amid a global slowdown in luxury spending.“We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group,” said Patrizio Bertelli, Prada’s executive director and long-time helmsperson of the brand. “We share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship, and heritage.”The acquisition comes at a discount. Capri Holdings, which acquired Versace for €1.83 billion in 2018, had to accept a reduced offer from Prada due to weakened sales and Trump-era tariffs that dented valuations.Adding to the intrigue, Donatella Versace — who took over the house after the tragic murder of her brother Gianni in 1997 — stepped down as creative director on April 1, paving the way for the deal.Donatella, now 69, will serve as the label’s chief brand ambassador.Her replacement, Dario Vitale, is the force behind the rise of Prada’s edgy younger sibling, Miu Miu — signaling a potential pivot for Versace from glitz to Gen Z.The merger brings together two distinct worlds: Versace’s opulent, baroque aesthetic and Prada’s cerebral minimalism. Prada insists it won’t erase Versace’s DNA but will instead enhance it with “industrial capabilities and operational expertise.”Yet analysts warn of a delicate balancing act.“This is a risky move,” said Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Bernstein. “Prada may become distracted from its core business, as happened with earlier acquisitions like Jil Sander and Helmut Lang.”Versace’s third-quarter revenue in fiscal 2025 fell 15 percent to $193 million, a far cry from Prada’s soaring performance. Under the guidance of creative director Miuccia Prada and CEO Andrea Guerra, Prada posted a 25 percent jump in net profit in 2024, reaching €839 million, with revenue climbing to €5.4 billion.Guerra acknowledged the task ahead: “The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution. Versace has huge potential — but evolution takes time.”The acquisition is more than a financial move — it’s a statement of intent. In recent years, French conglomerates have scooped up Italy’s brightest stars: Gucci, Fendi, Bottega Veneta. With this deal, Prada flips the script.“Prada will be able to bring light back into a brand that was dying and infuse it with new life,” said design consultant Antonio Bandini Conti.W hether the strategy pays off remains to be seen. But in a world where fashion loves a comeback, Prada is betting that Versace’s next chapter — wrapped in minimalist luxury and turbocharged by Milanese precision — could be its boldest yet.","Italian powerhouse Prada announced Thursday it will acquire flamboyant rival Versace from US-based Capri Holdings in a €1.25 billion (over Rs 12,000 crore) deal.

Why it matters

Here's what's at stake

Global supply chains: China is the world’s manufacturing hub, and US tariffs on its exports are already forcing multinationals to rethink sourcing. That means years of volatility, higher costs, and slower transitions for industries from tech and autos to apparel and pharmaceuticals.

The unpredictability of Trump’s tariff moves—escalating one day, pausing the next—has rattled markets. Companies, particularly in tech and finance, face a high-risk environment with no clear policy roadmap. Geopolitical decoupling: Beyond the economy, the tariff war is accelerating a broader strategic decoupling between the US and China. That includes technology, defense, academia, and even diplomacy—threatening decades of interdependence that have defined the post-Cold War era.

The big picture: A long game, not a quick resolution

1. Xi’s strategy: Strength at all costs

Xi has been very clear for a very long time that he expects China will enter a period of protracted struggle with the United States and its allies, that China needed to prepare for that, and they have quite extensively,” said Jacob Gunter, lead economy analyst at Berlin-based think tank MERICS. Xi Jinping has accepted that the gauntlet is thrown down, and they are ready to put up a fight. An article in CNN

2. Built for the long haul: Strategic endurance

US-bound exports have dropped from 20% of China's total in 2018 to under 15% today.

Manufacturers moved operations to third countries like Vietnam and Cambodia to sidestep tariffs.

China’s rare earth and advanced tech sectors have been strategically fortified.

Domestic innovation in AI, robotics, and semiconductors—especially via firms like Huawei and DeepSeek—has surged.

“The Chinese government has been preparing for this day for six years,” Victor Shih, of UC San Diego, told CNN.

China’s new posture signals that it’s not just surviving the trade war—it’s trying to use it to pivot away from economic dependence on the US.

3. Xi is 'president-for-life'; Trump is not

4. Economic costs: A two-way street

5. Diplomatic recalibration: Beijing’s global hedge

Trump thrives on disorder, keeping adversaries off-balance and sharpening his leverage. China, by contrast, is trapped in the art of the delay, waiting for clarity that never comes. The longer Xi stalls, the greater the peril, as Trump fills the vacuum with new tariffs and sidelines Beijing in a game that keeps accelerating. An article in Foreign Policy

Zoom in: 'Xi will not be forced into a call'

Bottom line

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday paused sweeping tariffs on most nations—but pointedly excluded China, jacking up levies on Beijing to a punishing 125%. China, in turn, hit back with retaliatory tariffs of 84% and vowed to “fight to the end.”China on Thursday called on the United States to meet it “halfway” in the escalating trade war. “The door to dialogue is open, but it must be based on mutual respect and conducted in an equal manner,” said commerce ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian.“The US tariffs seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system, and seriously impact the stability of the global economic order,” said foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian. “This is a blatant act that goes against the will of the world and goes against the whole world.” China will not sit back and let the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be deprived, Lin added.The US-China trade war has entered uncharted territory, threatening to fracture the world’s most important bilateral economic relationship and disrupt the global trading system.This isn't just another tariff spat—it’s a geopolitical showdown with ripple effects far beyond Washington and Beijing.The two countries represent nearly 40% of global GDP and account for over a quarter of global trade. A rupture between them isn't just bilateral pain—it’s systemic shock. Xi Jinping is not seeking a face-saving way out of Trump’s tariff spiral. He’s preparing for long-term confrontation. Xi's messaging is clear: China will not buckle under pressure. State media has leaned hard into nationalist rhetoric, framing the trade war as a patriotic struggle. The People’s Daily declared China had “rich experience” in managing economic conflict with the US and “ample plans” to support domestic industries.But this isn’t just about appearances. For Xi, giving in to Trump’s demands would weaken his image at home and abroad. As China’s most powerful leader since Mao, he can’t afford to be seen capitulating to a US president who boasts of ""winning"" every escalation. “China wants to make a deal, they just don’t know how quite to go about it,” Trump said. Beijing's response? Silence and defiance.Beijing has spent years preparing for this moment. After enduring Trump’s first trade war, Chinese officials launched a quiet but sweeping effort to reduce their economy’s exposure to the US.The results are now surfacing:Thousands marched in Washington and cities nationwide over the weekend, voicing opposition to President Trump. He's also drawing heat from Wall Street, where investors blame his tariffs for rattling global markets and triggering economic uncertainty.In contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping faces no such public backlash. With tight control over media and dissent, he can roll out monetary and fiscal support as needed to soften the social fallout.""Ultimately, it becomes a game of which country can actually manage its own population more effectively to manage the subsequent economic consequences from this trade war. Trump has to face, or at least Republican politicians have to face a lot of electoral pressure, and the American media are still pretty much free. So I think Trump's ability to fight politically with China is not that great,"" Zhiwu Chen, professor of finance at HKU Business School, told Reuters.B oth sides are feeling the pain. For China, the latest wave of tariffs could wipe out entire industries. Victor Shih, director at UCSD’s 21st Century China Center, warns of “millions of people becoming unemployed” and “a wave of bankruptcy” across Chinese exporters, according to a CNN report. Yet he also notes: “China can sustain that much more so than American politicians can.”In the US, JP Morgan analysts estimate that tariffs on China could cost American consumers and businesses up to $860 billion. Many Chinese goods—especially electronics, appliances, and industrial inputs—are hard to replace quickly. That means higher prices, supply chain disruptions, and delayed reshoring.What’s more, some of America’s biggest multinationals—like Tesla and Apple—have massive exposure in China. Chinese officials know this and have suggested they might target US firms, restrict services, or even ban entertainment content as part of the response.Even as Trump isolates China, Xi is deepening ties with Europe and Southeast Asia, offering incentives like lowered tariffs and increased export subsidies to sidestep US markets—and woo America’s frustrated allies.One of the most dangerous dynamics is the absence of credible negotiators. Trump has centralized trade decisions around himself, leaving cabinet officials and envoys unable to act with authority. China, watching the chaos, no longer knows who to talk to. Meanwhile, Xi has gutted China’s diplomatic flexibility—only he can decide to soften or escalate, and he has little incentive to back down, a Foreign Policy article said.“Xi will not be forced into a call,” Sun Yun, director of the China programme at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Centre, told AP. Craig Singleton, the senior China fellow at another Washington-based think tank, told AP that a phone call from Beijing is “unlikely in this climate.”“Each side believes time is on its side, which raises the risk that neither moves to de-escalate until real damage is done,” he said. “This is no longer about tariffs alone. It's a test of wills.”Trump and Xi are now trapped—each by their own strategy. Trump has framed the trade war as a crusade for economic justice and can’t afford to appear soft on China. Xi has stoked nationalist pride and positioned himself as the leader who will never bow to Western pressure. The result is a deadlock with no clear exit, no trusted interlocutors, and no incentive—political or economic—to fold.(With inputs from agencies)","China responded quickly to Trump’s tariffs, but its countermeasures were limited in scope.

Several countries have restricted importing these products for decades because they don't meet their food safety regulations In an announcement on April 2, Trump called out Australian restrictions on US beef, saying: ""We imported $3 billion [€2.7 billion] of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won't take any of our beef.""His administration also singled out the UK and EU for ""non-science-based"" restrictions on importing US beef, and Argentina for its ban of live US cattle exports.Trump has used these import bans as part of his rationale to impose new trade tariffs.There are different reasons why Australia, Argentina, the European Union and the United Kingdom don't import some American beef products.For Australia and Argentina, the restrictions date back to 2003 when bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was detected in US cattle. BSE is a disease which affects the nervous system of cattle caused by misfolded proteins known as prions.It's also known as Mad Cow Disease.Humans can become infected with the disease when they eat meat contaminated with BSE. It is known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Globally, a total of 233 people have died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after eating BSE-infected meat.US health authorities reduced the spread of BSE among US cattle sufficiently to see the ban on beef exports to Australia lifted in 2019.""There may be a feeling from some producers or companies in the US that Australia is banning US beef, but there's no ban in place,"" said Robyn Alders, a veterinary scientist at the Australian National University.But US imports are still restricted if they don't meet Australia's strict biosecurity laws. For US beef to be allowed into Australia, US cattle farmers must prove their cattle are entirely bred, grown and slaughtered in the US.""To do that [tracing] in a way that would still make their product a cost-efficient thing to ship that product across to Australia, there are very few companies — virtually none at the moment — that are willing to take that on,"" Alders said.Argentina lifted its BSE ban on American beef products in 2018 but has maintained the restriction on live cattle imports until the two countries finalize a new ""sanitary certificate"".The EU and UK have restricted US beef imports since 1989 because the US cattle industry sometimes uses growth hormones to increase meat and milk yields. The EU does import non-hormone-treated beef from the US.US dairy and cattle farmers routinely use hormones like estradiol 17ß and testosterone to promote faster growth and improve feed efficiency.The EU's ban rationale, which is also maintained by the UK post-Brexit, is based on its own scientific evaluation showing that daily intake of growth hormones can have negative health impacts, including evidence that estradiol 17ß can cause cancerous tumor growth.The US cattle industry has argued against the EU's restrictions, saying food safety testing in the US shows no risk to adult health.""[However], the European perspective is that the entire population does not consist only of health adults, but [also] of infants, children, the elderly, the immunologically compromised,” said Erik Millstone, an expert in food and science policy at the University of Sussex, UK.""EU authorities have done a much more comprehensive assessment of the risk of consuming hormone-treated beef [compared to US authorities],"" Millstone said.The US has also criticized EU bans on importing US poultry that has been cleaned in chlorine.US poultry farmers wash poultry meat in chlorine solutions to kill harmful bacteria such as campylobacter, which commonly causes food poisoning.The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has said that chemical substances in poultry meat are unlikely to pose a health risk for consumers.However, European authorities are concerned that rinsing chicken in chlorine at the end of the food production process allows lower standards of hygiene and animal welfare in earlier stages.EU regulations legislate animal welfare at all stages of the ""farm to fork"" process.Millstone adds that some research shows that chlorine rinsing may not actually have the intended effect of decontaminating meat.""The chlorinated water was not an effective disinfectant. The bacteria remained in place, remained pathogenic, remained dangerous, infectious, but were just not detected,"" Millstone said.As a result, rates of bacterial food poisoning in the US are substantially higher than they are in the European Union or UK, Millstone said.For the time being, US animal farming practices are either incompatible or too impractical to meet the food safety demands of export markets.Australia and Argentina are open to importing US beef, but US producers must meet their regulatory standards.For the UK and EU, it's a more difficult path, which would require US producers to cease using growth hormones in beef production and end the practice of chlorine washing in poultry.Polling data suggest Europeans are against allowing US meat products in — a 2020 poll found 80% of the British public are against allowing imports of chlorinated chicken.","US President Donald Trump wants other countries to import more American beef and poultry. Several countries have restricted importing these products for decades because they don't meet their food safety regulations.

Tariffs dim festive cheer

'US orders will come down'

‘We’re a happy, joyful business’

Chinese producers of plastic Christmas trees and other holiday items say they’ve yet to receive any orders from their US clients – and they fear they may not get any at all, reports news agency Reuters.The delay comes amid soaring US import tariffs, with US President Donald Trump ramping up levies on Chinese goods by 104% this year alone.Manufacturers across China have expressed concerns as international clients lower, pause, or even cancel orders.“By mid-April all the orders are normally finalised,” said Qun Ying , who runs a Christmas tree factory in Jinhua, eastern China. He was quoted as saying to Reuters, “But right now ... it's hard to know if any orders are coming. Maybe American customers won’t buy anything this year.”Across the festive supply chain, manufacturers are reporting a standstill. Jessica Guo , also based in Jinhua, said one of her major American buyers has just paused a 3 million yuan ($408,191) order after spending 400,000 yuan on materials.“I expect that order will soon be cancelled,” she told Reuters. “My peers and I rely on U.S. orders to survive. This will inevitably affect a lot of people.No one can escape.”Guo noted that domestic demand for Christmas decorations in China is negligible. “Losing the U.S. market will definitely impact many people’s jobs,” she said.Her 10,800-square metre factory usually employs 140 people, with the workforce swelling to 200 during the summer peak. This year, she doesn’t expect to hire extra staff.US retailers source 87% of their Christmas decorations from China, amounting to roughly $4 billion annually. Meanwhile, Chinese factories sell about half of their stock to the US market. This dependency on each other is now being tested by the escalating trade war.Now that tariffs have been slapped on countries like Cambodia — which supplies just 5.5% of America's Christmas decorations — shoppers in the US could be left with emptier shelves and higher prices.“If Americans want new Christmas decorations this year, they will have to pay a lot more for them — if they can find them on the shelves at all,” one exporter told Reuters.In the Chinese city of Shaoxing, factory owner Liu Song is attempting to adapt by shifting his focus away from the US.“We are worried that U.S. orders will come down,” he said. “But we will definitely win this trade war.” Song is now targeting markets in Russia, Europe and Southeast Asia , which already take in 75% of his products.Economists predict the trade war will shave 1–2 percentage points off China’s economic growth this year. As Chinese exporters lose US orders, they’re likely to slash prices to stay competitive elsewhere — squeezing already-thin profit margins and threatening jobs at home.Jami Warner , head of the American Christmas Tree Association, says the country lacks the labour, skills, and technology to make it happen.“They certainly can't be made in the United States,” she said. “There's no manufacturing, the technology isn't here, the labour market isn't here.”Warner estimates price hikes are inevitable and warns the whole sector has become “collateral damage” in a geopolitical battle.“What our members make and sell are not strategic products,” she added. “We’re not threatening. We’re a happy, joyful business. We’d like to stay in that joyful business.”","Manufacturers across China have expressed concerns as international clients lower, pause, or even cancel orders.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

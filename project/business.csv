Gold price prediction today: Gold rates expected to maintain positive trend in coming months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-september-23-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-outlook/articleshow/124060479.cms,"Gold price outlook: The yellow metal may rise to $3800/$3850 in the coming months. Long-term target is $4000. (AI image)

Gold rates are likely to maintain their long-term positive bias, with dips and corrections serving as buying opportunity for investors, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

The analyst shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

Spot gold closed with a hefty gain of 1.1% at $3685 on Friday as the US Fed rate cuts helped the metal regain its bullish momentum. The yellow metal recorded its fifth straight weekly gain as it was up 1.1% in the week ending September 19.

On September 22, the metal extended its rally in the expectations of further rate cuts. The rally gathered pace ahead of the newly appointed Fed Governor Miran's speech, as following his vote for a 50-bps rate cut at the FOMC meeting concluded on September 17, markets have been hopeful that he would again press for outsized rate cuts. He was the only dissenter in the September 17 monetary policy decision meeting as he also wanted to cut rates by another 1.25 percentage points at the two remaining FOMC meetings this year, as compared to the Fed's median view of lowering rates by another 50-bps.

As widely expected, on Monday, he called the Fed's rate regime too restrictive and pushed for aggressive rate cuts.

The shiny metal was changing hands at $3743, up by 1.57%, at the time of writing this report, while the MCX gold October contract at Rs 112,200 was up by nearly 2%.

Stephen Miran' speech:

Speaking on 'economic outlook' at Economic Club of New York on September 22, Miran, President Trump's appointee to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, said that due to sharp declines in immigration, rising tariff revenue and aging population, Fed's rate should be closer to 2.5% rather than the current 4%-4.25%. He said that series of 50-bps cuts will recalibrate policy and it is better to move to neutral more quickly than less quickly. He sees CPI rent inflation falling below 1.5% in 2027 from 3.5%. Miran estimates neutral real rate, level of rate that neither boosts nor constrains economy, to be close to zero as immigration restrictions, higher saving rates because of tariffs and the raft of tax cuts passed earlier this year have significantly lowered estimates.

Other Fed speakers are cautious though:

St Louis Fed President Musalem said on Monday that he sees limited room for more reductions, and only under certain circumstances.

Atlanta Fed President Bostic in an interview published Monday in the WSJ said that he was hesitant to declare his support for another rate cut in October meeting as he finds that inflation has been too high for too long.

Upcoming data and events:

President Donald Trump will address on the first day of high-level General Debate at the 80th UN General Assembly (UNGA) beginning on September 22 in New York. The debate runs through Sept. 29.

Ukrainian President Zelenskiy will meet Trump on the sidelines of UNGA to persuade him to join a security guarantees framework.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak on the economic outlook at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce in Rhode Island on Sept 23.

Major upcoming US data on tap this week include S&P global US PMIs (Sep. 23), new home sales (Sep. 24), Q2 GDP tertiary (Sep. 25), PCE Price Index (September 26), real personal spending (Sept. 26) and University of Michigan inflation expectations and consumer sentiment (Sept. 26).

The Eurozone's PMIs will be out on September 23.

Gold ETF holdings:

As of September 19, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 95.83 Moz, a fresh cycle high, and now at the highest level since May 2022.

ETF holdings have risen for four straight weeks and are up 15.66% YTD.

Fiscal turmoil in Argentina:

Argentina, which must meet about $9.50 billion in debt payments next year, is witnessing a slump in its currency Peso. The Peso has declined around 4% since September 19 as investors started pulling out of Argentina after he suffered a local election defeat on September 7, which in turn raised the stakes of for midterm congressional election in October. The US as offered all the possible help to Argentina.

US Dollar Index and US yields:

Following a 3-day winning streak, the US Dollar Index declined on September 22 and at the time of writing was seen at 97.39, down nearly .3% for the day.

Ten-year US yields at 4.13% were up by 0.14%, while 2-year yields rose by 1.5 bps to 3.586%.

Geopolitical watch:

France and other countries were set to join Australia, Britain, Portugal, and Canada in recognizing a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly in New York.

France's rating downgrade:

France's credit rating was downgraded again within a week as following a downgrade by Fitch, Morningstar DBRS, on September 20, downgraded the rating to AA from AA (high) due to a deterioration in the outlook for its public finances amid challenges posed by growing domestic political fragmentation and reduced policy consensus in recent years.

Indian Rupee under pressure:

The Indian Rupee is under pressure on concerns over H1 visa fees hike, which supports domestic gold prices per se.

Gold Price Outlook:

Gold supported by a confluence of bullish factors like Fed rate cut expectations, geopolitical concerns, and political and fiscal worries is likely to trade with a positive bias. Healthy ETF inflows also support the bullish bias.

The yellow metal may rise to $3800/$3850 in the coming months. Long-term target is $4000.

The Fed Chair Powell’s speech on September 23 could be somewhat hawkish so that constitutes a possible downside risk to gold prices.

Nonetheless, overall outlook remains positive and buy the dips remains the preferred strategy.

Support is at $3700 (MCX gold October contract Rs 110,900)/$3650 (Rs 109,400). Resistance is at $3775 (Rs 113,200)/$3800 (Rs 113,900)/$3850 (Rs 115,400).

MCX gold rates at USDINR rate of Rs 88.29.

H-1B Crackdown! Trump Imposes $100k Fee; Indians & Tech Giants Face Major Hit; Know All About It

H-1B Visas: Wall Street Banks May Increase India Talent Dependence





US President Donald Trump ’s move to steeply hike the H-1B visa fees to $100,000 in a bid to create more jobs for Americans may actually end up backfiring! Major Wall Street banks are actually expected to increase their dependence on business support centres in India after Trump’s fee hike for new H-1B visa applications.Despite Trump's intention to safeguard American employment through immigration restrictions, analysts suggest these new regulations might encourage banks to strengthen their presence in Indian technology centres like Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which currently provide employment to over 1.9 million individuals.H-1B visas, extensively utilised by technology sectors in India and the US for skilled foreign workers, also see significant usage from financial and consulting organisations. During the US fiscal year ending September 2023, Indian nationals constituted 72.3% of total H-1B recipients, which includes both new and renewed employment.Also Read | The $100,000 H-1B gamble: Why Donald Trump’s visa tax won’t save American jobs - winners and losers According to a Bloomberg report, leading American banks, including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are significant employers at India's global capability centres, which handle various functions from trading assistance and risk assessment to technical support.These centres, employing software engineers, quantitative analysts and accounting professionals, provide cost-effective services whilst offering access to qualified professionals who are scarce in their domestic markets.US banks maintain substantial presence in this sector, enabling potential work relocation to India to navigate new visa regulations. The workforce numbers are significant: Citigroup maintains 33,000 personnel in India, Bank of America Corp. employs over 27,000, whilst JPMorgan has 10,000 staff.""Unless new restrictions are placed on offshoring, foreign banks will lean even more on their Indian capability centers,"" Umesh Chhazzed, founder of recruitment firm Anlage Infotech, who has worked with US lenders for more than two decades was quoted as saying in the Bloomberg report.According to EY data quoted in the report, Global Capability Centres have evolved into a $64 billion industry, showing 9.8% annual growth from 2019 to 2024. These centres are expected to increase from the current 1,700 to approximately 2,500 by 2030, with projected market value reaching $110 billion.""Banks would be calibrating a new strategy for the global capability centers. It appears, there will be onshoring of jobs to India adding new job functions,"" said Abizer Diwanji, founder of NeoStart Advisors LLP, a financial advisory firm. ""However, none will jump the gun amid evolving situations. They will wait for more clarity,” he was quoted as saying.Also Read | Alternatives to H-1B visas: After fee hike by Trump to $100,000, O1 & L1 visas gain traction; check cost, approval rates Research published in the Management Science journal indicates that companies typically respond to skilled immigration restrictions by increasing overseas recruitment. The 2023 study reveals that highly internationalised companies typically employ one overseas worker for each visa application rejection.According to the report, JPMorgan has welcomed the exemption of current H-1B visa holders from the new fee. Sjoerd Leenart, the bank's Asia-Pacific executive, during a Bloomberg Television interview on Monday indicated that an evaluation of the proposed modifications was premature.According to Parvathy Tharamel, partner at Trilegal law firm, India has established itself as the foundation of global capability centres for international banks, managing essential business, compliance, technology and innovation operations.""The new H-1B restrictions will only accelerate this trend, pushing more cross-border technology and high-value roles into India hubs,"" she was quoted as saying.Nevertheless, growth initiatives might be constrained by the possibility of additional US measures affecting banks' international strategies.","H-1B visas extensively utilised by technology sectors in India and US for skilled foreign workers.

"Lenders seek safety, young borrowers hold back: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lenders-seek-safety-young-borrowers-hold-back-report/articleshow/124103120.cms,"



MUMBAI: Lenders are playing it safe, borrowers are being cautious, and fewer youngsters are seeking credit going by trends in Q1FY26, a report by credit bureau TransUnion Cibil showed.The report, which analyses credit trends for the June quarter, said portfolios are tilting towards secured lending, with collateral-backed loans growing faster than consumption-led credit. In the three months to June 2025, disbursals rose 16% for property loans, 34% for gold loans, and 6% for home loans. In contrast, personal loans rose 9%, auto loans 4%, and two-wheeler loans 3%, underscoring the weaker appetite for unsecured borrowing.The Credit Market Indicator (CMI) for the quarter stood at 98, down from 102 a year earlier, showing a moderation in the retail credit market as portfolios shift and demand from younger consumers slows.TransUnion Cibil’s CMI measures the health of the retail credit market by aggregating several data points across four main pillars: credit demand, credit supply, consumer behavior, and credit performance New-to-credit consumers accounted for a smaller share of loan originations.Their contribution fell to 16% in the quarter, two percentage points lower than last year. Origination volumes also fell sharply for some products, with credit cards declining 20% and twowheeler loans slipping 1%.Portfolio quality has broadly held up, but the report flagged emerging signs of strain. Among prime borrowers, 25% saw their scores downgraded over a 12-month period, compared with 23% a year earlier, pointing to mild repayment stress. Young consumers are showing less interest in credit. The demand CMI fell to 92 in June from 95 a year earlier and 98 in June 2023. Enquiry volumes from those under 25 years dropped from 19% of the total in June 2023 to 18% this year, while those from the 26–35 age group declined from 40% to 38% in the same period. .","The report said portfolios are tilting towards secured lending.

GST Appellate Tribunal must address litigation delays: FM Sitharaman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-appellate-tribunal-must-address-litigation-delays-fm-sitharaman/articleshow/124103092.cms,"‘GST Bachat Utsav’ Kicks Off: Modi Unveils Reforms for Middle Class, Farmers





NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said that outcome of GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) must be straightforward with reduced legal frictions, greater simplicity, and should be proactively addressing delays in litigations to ensure better cash flow.“Until now, taxpayers had to navigate different product clarifications on various state interpretations, leading to delays and locked-up capital, especially for MSMEs. With GSTAT, disputes will converge at one forum. This is one nation, one tax, and now one adjudicating body,” FM said while launching the tribunal, which she described as a milestone reform.The tribunal, with principal bench in the Capital and 31 state benches across 45 locations, will hear appeals against orders from the First Appellate Authority (FAA) of GST. It is also tasked with acting as the National Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling from April 2026, to bring consistency in rulings across states.The minister said GSTAT will focus on clear, jargon free rulings, digital filings, virtual hearings, and strict timelines. A digital portal for e-courts has been rolled out, allowing taxpayers and advisors to file and track appeals online. Hearings are expected to begin by Dec and the limitation period for pending appeals has been extended up to June 30, 2026.The finance minister also stated that the move comes after years of delay. Although benches were notified in 2019, legal hurdles stalled progress until the appointment of Justice Sanjay Mishra as GSTAT President in 2024. The Supreme Court has overseen the selection of judicial and technical members to ensure transparency.“It will be a pillar of trust for businesses and a catalyst for India’s growth,” Sitharaman said. She also spoke on the increase in domestic consumption after the GST rate cut, stating, “Every early report in the media pointed to the unprecedented sales and bookings in the first two days of this ‘Bachat Utsav’.”","The tribunal will hear appeals against orders from the First Appellate Authority (FAA) of GST.

Goldman Sachs upgraded Maruti Suzuki to buy with the target price raised to Rs 18,900. Analysts said the stock price upgrade was to factor in a potential pickup in market for entry level cars post GST cuts and price changes, resumption of new model launches after a gap of 2.5 years with Victoris SUV and eVitara, favorable exposure to pay commission in upcoming auto demand cycle, and a relatively low CO2 risk versus peers heading into CAFE 3 regime in FY28.Nuvama upgraded CESC to buy with the target price at Rs 200. Analysts said CESC’s renewable energy (RE) growth plans have solidified and the company aims to double profit after tax (PAT) to Rs 2,800 over FY25–FY30. This would be led by substantial addition to its RE capacity, and new solar manufacturing initiative by FY28. They said while the current market price captures recent tariff hikes/resource adequacy (RA) recovery, valuations underplay strong RE pipeline and solar manufacturing initiative while a potential UP discom win could add a new growth optionality.Antique Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on UPL with a target price of Rs 760, up from Rs 730. Analysts feel deleveraging remains the key re-rating catalyst for the stock, while divestments, if any, could provide some upside. The company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margin is expected to gradually scale up to 22%-23% in the medium term.The company management expects FY26 revenue/EBITDA growth of 4%-8%/10%-14% on an annualised basis.The company’s projected net debt for FY26 is at Rs 13,000 crore and Rs 10,500 crore by FY27, leading to reduction in debt-equity and net debt/EBITDA ratios.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Swiggy with the target price at Rs 450. Analysts said Swiggy's board approved sale in Rapido for Rs 2,400 crore, strengthening its balance sheet and in line with management commentary.The company’s board also approved Swiggy transferring its Instamart business into a wholly owned step-down subsidiary on a slump sale basis. As per the company, this proposed transfer would help create an efficient and more focused entity for the quick commerce business.Citigroup has a sell on IndusInd Bank with the target price at Rs 765. Analysts said after a new CEO and a new CFO coming on board, the bank is now focusing on filling ED positions. They also feel that forward flows (particularly in the MFI sector) would keep slippages elevated, while a stabilization/normalization is expected in the second half of FY26.They also feel the bank’s credit costs are contingent on accelerated write-off timing (amortized through the fiscal or one-time impairment). They expect a weak vehicle finance demand, run-down in MFI to be offset by the growth in other retail segments, and a resumption in corporate growth. Analysts also feel rebuilding fee income will be key post-reset to low base in the first quarter. There are efforts underway to curtail opex growth.","Goldman Sachs upgraded Maruti Suzuki to buy with the target price raised to Rs 18,900.

MUMBAI: GST reforms, coupled with a five-quarter high GDP growth, have positioned the Indian economy for a sustained period of expansion, RBI ’s ‘State of the Economy’ report released on Wednesday showed. The report presents an optimistic outlook for second half (H2) of the fiscal year, suggesting that robust domestic drivers are set to overcome global uncertainties, including new US trade tariffs.According to the report, the stage is set for sustained pick up in consumption demand in H2, and potentially for a virtuous cycle of higher investment and stronger growth impulses, overcoming persistent global uncertainties. The drivers for this virtuous cycle are the ‘robust’ pass through of the 100 basis point rate cut between February and August. This, coupled with cut in income tax and simplification of GST are expected to revive growth impulses.The report highlights that the recently-implemented GST reforms are a key catalyst for future growth. “The landmark GST reforms should progressively result in a sustained positive impact through significant gains in ease of doing business, lower retail prices and strengthening of consumption growth drivers”.This aligns with the report’s overall positive projections for the coming months.According to the report, the Indian economy’s current strength is fundamentally domestic. In Q1 2025-26, the economy achieved a five-quarter high in growth, propelled by strong consumption and fixed investment. The report notes a remarkable resilience in domestic demand, with rural consumption remaining robust and a broad-based expansion across sectors. The manufacturing and services sectors, in particular, saw significant growth, with their respective PMIs reaching an 18-year and a decade high. Going ahead, favourable monsoon conditions and robust kharif sowing are expected to support the agriculture sector and help contain food prices.Despite this internal strength, the report acknowledges significant external risks. “Global uncertainty remained elevated in the wake of imposition of US trade tariffs on major trading partners and renewed concerns over fiscal health of advanced economies”. The imposition of a 50% US import tariff on Indian exports led to a temporary decline in equity markets and contributed to a depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar. However, robust domestic institutional buying successfully offset foreign portfolio investor outflows, showcasing the economy’s ability to absorb external shocks.","GST reforms, coupled with a five-quarter high GDP growth, have positioned the Indian economy for a sustained period of expansion.

NEW DELHI : With Trump’s tariff fears looming large, export of smartphones to the US — primarily comprising Apple’s iPhone — grew 190% in April-Aug 2025 at $8.4 billion against $2.9 billion in the year-ago period.Such had been the rush in export of India-made devices that the five-month figures had already reached nearly 80% of the entire FY25 smartphone exports of $10.6 billion to the US, figures compiled by Indian Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) showed. With concerns over Trump tariffs growing in the early months of the year, companies such as Apple gave a major push to exports from India.With factories of Taiwanese Foxconn and the Tata Group expanding production aggressively, most of the demand in the American markets is currently being met by Indian manufacturing. This was also announced by Apple’s Global CEO Tim Cook in his analyst call after the last quarter results. “In terms of the country of origin, it’s the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn’t been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the US or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India,” the Apple CEO said on July 31.Led by the US, overall smartphone exports in the first five months of FY26 reached a record $11.7 billion (around Rs 1 lakh crore), a 55% increase over the $7.6 billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. Smartphones have emerged as one of the best performing categories in the country’s export kitty over the last five years since the launch of the production-linked incentive scheme.",Export of smartphones to the US grew 190% in April-Aug 2025 at $8.4 billion.

China’s move ‘to safeguard WTO’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-move-to-safeguard-wto/articleshow/124102771.cms,"



China will no longer claim benefits available to developing nations at the World Trade Organization, announced Chinese Premier Li Qiang. He is currently in the US to attend the United Nations General Assembly. WTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala welcomed the decision on X, calling it “a culmination of many years of hard work” and thanking China’s leadership. The gesture is significant at a time when higher US tariffs are forcing China to divert ever more of its exports to rising economic powers from Latin America to Africa and Southeast Asia, a push that’s starting to meet resistance around the world.And as Beijing looks to negotiate a more lasting trade deal with the US, it’s also likely an effort to curry favour with President Donald Trump, who has long bristled at the designation he’d said was unfairly applied to the world’s second-biggest economy.While no longer eligible for the special treatment, China’s status as a developing nation won’t change, Han Yong, a ministry of commerce official in charge of relations with WTO, said in Beijing on Wednesday. Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and veteran US trade negotiator, said the announcement is “years too late”.“In light of the absence of a WTO negotiating agenda and the slow pace of its reform efforts, the announcement — while welcome — will have little practical effect,” said Cutler.But it “will help Beijing make the case of its enduring commitment to the multilateral trading system, in sharp contrast to Washington which is holding up its dues to the organisation.”China’s move not to claim the benefits “is an important measure to safeguard and strengthen the multilateral trading system”. The US Trade Representative and the White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information on the announcement.","China will no longer claim benefits available to developing nations at the World Trade Organization, announced Chinese Premier Li Qiang.

Argentina-US swap line talks: Washington proposes $20 billion support; peso rises 2.4% ahead of elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/argentina-us-swap-line-talks-washington-proposes-20-billion-support-peso-rises-2-4-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/124094625.cms,"File photo (AP)





The US Treasury is in discussions with Argentina to provide a $20 billion swap line to the South American country’s central bank, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday, as right-wing President Javier Milei seeks to stabilise markets ahead of upcoming midterm elections. Following the announcement, the Argentine peso gained 2.4 percent to 1,333.90 per dollar.“The Treasury is currently in negotiations with Argentine officials for a $20 billion swap line with the Central Bank,” Bessent said in a social media post, a day after he and US President Donald Trump spoke with Milei, AFP reported. He added that the US is also prepared to purchase Argentina’s dollar-denominated bonds as needed.Milei, an ally of Trump in Latin America, thanked the US leadership for their “support and confidence.” Swap lines allow central banks to exchange currencies at predetermined rates for a specified period, helping stabilise markets during periods of financial stress.Trump, speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, said the US would assist Argentina but added, “I don’t think they need a bailout.” Argentina’s currency had weakened sharply after Milei’s party lost the Buenos Aires provincial election on September 7, a key indicator ahead of national legislative elections on October 26.Bessent emphasised that Argentina “has the tools to defeat speculators, including those who seek to destabilise Argentina’s markets for political objectives.” However, domestic criticism emerged, with Senator Elizabeth Warren calling a potential US intervention “deeply troubling” and questioning the use of emergency funds to bolster a foreign government’s financial markets.The announcement comes as Milei faces declining support following two years of austerity measures and a corruption scandal involving his sister, after initially being cheered by investors upon his 2023 election.","The US Treasury is in discussions with Argentina to provide a $20 billion swap line.

The Nasdaq composite was up 0.1%, with all three indexes hovering close to all-time peaks set on Monday.The market’s recent surge, which began after April lows, has been driven by hopes that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will not disrupt global trade and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to support economic growth.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Wednesday welcomed China’s decision not to seek new special treatment in future WTO negotiations, calling it a step toward a more equitable global trading system.“This is a pivotal moment for the WTO,” said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, WTO Director-General, news agency AFP reported. “China's decision reflects a commitment to a more balanced and equitable global trading system.”Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced on Tuesday, during a high-level meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, that Beijing would no longer pursue special and differential treatment — privileges granted to developing nations — in upcoming WTO talks, according to China’s official Xinhua news agency.Li described China as “a responsible major developing country,” emphasizing the announcement was aimed at addressing challenges to the multilateral trading system.Li Yihong, China’s charge d’affaires at its WTO mission, told reporters that the decision does not change China’s classification as a developing country. “This is a concrete measure to proactively assume responsibility and demonstrate the commitment of a major developing country,” she said.Special and differential treatment under WTO agreements allows developing countries longer timeframes for implementing commitments and measures to expand trading opportunities.

'Both India, US-Based Firms Have Raised Concerns': Dhruva Jaishankar On H-1B Fee Hike

Firms will cut H-1B workers



Impact on startups







The Trump administration’s sharp increase in visa fees for H-1B workers has triggered concern among US technology companies, with many considering moving more jobs overseas — the very outcome the policy aimed to prevent.US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants, a visa program long used by tech firms to recruit skilled workers and by international students seeking US employment after postgraduate studies.While the fee applies only to new applicants and not current visa holders, confusion around its rollout and cost has prompted companies to pause hiring and adjust workforce plans.“I have had several conversations with corporate clients … where they have said this new fee is simply unworkable in the US, and it's time for us to start looking for other countries where we can have highly skilled talent,” said Chris Thomas, immigration attorney at Colorado-based law firm Holland & Hart, as quoted by Reuters.“And these are large companies, some of them household names, Fortune 100 type companies, that are saying, we just simply cannot continue.”Previously costing employers only a few thousand dollars, the new $100,000 fee flips the equation, making hiring talent in countries like India, where wages are lower and Big Tech increasingly builds innovation hubs, more attractive.“We probably have to reduce the number of H-1B visa workers we can hire,” said Sam Liang, co-founder and CEO of AI meeting assistant startup Otter.ai.“Some companies may have to outsource some of their workforce — hire maybe in India or other countries just to walk around this H-1B problem,” he added.“Blanket rulings like this are rarely good for immigration,” said Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, which has invested in startups including AI firm Anthropic.“For larger companies, the cost is not material. For smaller companies, those with fewer than 25 employees, it's much more significant. Big tech CEOs expected this and will pay. For them, fewer small competitors is even an advantage. It’s the smaller startups that suffer most,” he added, as reported by Reuters.Analysts warn the policy could reduce the number of talented immigrants who often go on to launch new firms. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of US startups valued at $1 billion or more had at least one immigrant founder.","US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants.

Despite Trump 'Economic Sanctions', India's Russian Oil Flow Ramped Up As U.S Trade Talks Resume





Russia’s crude oil exports have climbed to a 16-month high at a time when its own refineries are reeling under drone attacks from Ukraine. Vessel-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg shows that the four-week average exports from Russian ports reached 3.62 million barrels daily during the period ending September 21.This marks the highest level since May 5, 2024. The four-week average provides more reliable trend indicators compared to weekly statistics.Russia's oil production is increasing as part of an OPEC+ agreement, which has allowed Moscow to raise its output by over 400,000 barrels daily since March. Recent drone attacks on refineries have compelled companies to redirect crude to export terminals, further increasing the export volume.JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates indicate that Russian refining operations have declined to under 5 million barrels daily, the lowest since April 2022, due to Ukrainian drone attacks.Typically, Russia's downstream sector processed approximately 5.4 million barrels of crude daily during August and September, suggesting these strikes have impacted at least 7% of Russia's fuel production capacity, according to Bloomberg calculations.The strikes on pipeline-connected pumping stations have not significantly disrupted supplies to export terminals along Russia's Baltic and Black Sea shores. The Baltic port of Primorsk achieved a milestone by loading 12 crude cargoes in the previous week. Whilst pump station damage may reduce flow rates, it hasn't caused complete stoppages, and port storage facilities enable continuous shipments during repair work.The prospect of additional sanctions to compel Russia towards peace negotiations regarding Ukraine appears distant.US President Donald Trump has stated that further American measures depend on European Union nations completely stopping Russian oil purchases, which seems unlikely in the near term as Hungary and Slovakia remain resistant.The EU is considering implementing trade measures, such as tariffs, to address remaining crude volumes instead of sanctions. Trade measures require only majority support, whilst sanctions need unanimous approval from member states.Vessel-tracking data and port-agent reports indicate that between September 15-21, 31 tankers loaded 23.69 million barrels of Russian crude, an increase from the previous week's 22.26 million barrels carried by 29 vessels.The total value of Moscow's exports showed a modest increase, rising by approximately $50 million to reach $1.33 billion in the week to September 21.","Russia's oil production is increasing as part of an OPEC+ agreement, which has allowed Moscow to raise its output by over 400,000 barrels daily since March.

Kenvue stock rebounds: Tylenol maker rises 6% after Donald Trump’s autism claims; analysts see limited legal impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/kenvue-stock-rebounds-tylenol-maker-rises-6-after-donald-trumps-autism-claims-analysts-see-limited-legal-impact/articleshow/124074082.cms,"Trump Stirs Panic On Tylenol Use, Warns Of Autism Link; Sparks Uproar | Make America Healthy Again





Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a steep fall triggered by President Donald Trump’s unfounded remarks linking the drug to autism.At the opening bell, Kenvue shares climbed more than 6 per cent, a day after plunging 7.5 per cent, AP reported. Trump had repeatedly instructed pregnant women to avoid Tylenol during a White House press conference on Monday, also cautioning mothers against giving the drug—known as acetaminophen in the US and paracetamol in many other countries—to infants.“Don’t take Tylenol,” Trump told pregnant women around a dozen times, despite relying on older studies rather than significant new research. His comments coincided with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, promoting the “Make America Healthy Again” campaign, which has focused on potential causes of autism.Kenvue strongly rejected the claim, saying there is no proven link between acetaminophen and autism. The company warned that pregnant women could face “a dangerous choice” if they avoid Tylenol, potentially exposing themselves to untreated fevers or riskier alternatives.Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni told AP “limited risk of new lawsuits after Trump’s announcement” but cautioned that “there could be risk to Tylenol consumption given the negative headlines.”He expected a positive market reaction given the absence of new scientific evidence.Kenvue, spun off from Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical and medical device divisions in 2023, makes Band-Aids, Listerine and other well-known brands in addition to Tylenol. The company has already faced hundreds of lawsuits over alleged ties between Tylenol and autism, but most have been dismissed.The consumer health firm’s recovery also comes in the shadow of Tylenol’s troubled history. In the 1980s, seven people in the Chicago area died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules, an incident that sparked nationwide panic and led to sweeping reforms in over-the-counter medicine packaging. No one was ever charged.","Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a steep fall triggered by President Donald Trump’s unfounded remarks linking the drug to autism.

The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 69 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.7% as of 1:30 p.m. Eastern time, AP reported.After surging from a bottom in April, the broad US stock market is facing criticism for rapid gains, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noting that stock prices “broadly look fairly highly valued.”Tech heavyweight Nvidia weighed on the market, giving back 2.7% of its previous day’s gains after announcing a partnership with OpenAI to expand data centers.

Fed officials have signaled potential additional rate cuts, but caution that lower rates may exacerbate inflation.US Treasury yields ticked lower, with the 10-year yield easing to 4.12% from 4.15% late Monday.

China’s internet watchdog has moved against two major platforms, Bytedance owned news app Jinri Toutiao and Alibaba’s internet browser company UCWeb, accusing them of spreading harmful material. The move was announced on Tuesday, a day after Beijing launched a two-month campaign to tighten control over online content.The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said on Monday it would crack down on material that fuels “malicious incitement of conflict” or encourages “negative outlooks on life such as world-weariness”.Authorities in Beijing already require social media firms to heavily police their platforms, keeping out anything they judge subversive, pornographic, vulgar or otherwise damaging.This month, the CAC had already penalised three well-known sites, Weibo, Kuaishou and Xiaohongshu, for what it called poor oversight of content. The regulator has not disclosed what punishment they faced.Toutiao, the news app came under fire for allowing “harmful content” to appear on the main page of its trending searches. The CAC said the company had failed in its duty to manage information properly and in doing so had “damaged the online ecosystem”.Actions taken against the firm include “summoning the company for a meeting, ordering rectification within a specified time limit, issuing a warning, and strictly dealing with those responsible”. No further details were released.“Internet regulators will continue to focus on prominent illegal and non-compliant activities that undermine the online ecosystem,” the CAC said in its statement cited by AFP.Alibaba’s UCWeb also faces sanctions. The CAC accused the browser service of posting entries linked to “extremely sensitive and malicious” issues, citing subjects such as “online violence and the privacy of minors”.The two-month campaign, launched on Monday, will target a wide range of online behaviour. The regulator said the drive is designed “to regulate the malicious incitement of conflict and the promotion of violence and vicious currents”.It also wants to stamp out attempts to exploit trending events by “forcibly associate identity, region or gender with other information, stigmatising and hyping them.”","Bytedance owned news app Jinri Toutiao and Alibaba’s internet browser company UCWeb accused of spreading harmful material.

Low oil prices pose challenges



Renewable energy outlook







US President Donald Trump’s tariffs are creating uncertainty into the global economy, impacting investment decisions more than supply chain costs, said Shell India’s Robin Mooldijk, president of projects and technology.“The primary effect is on our supply chain. It becomes more expensive and for a company like Shell it's something that we could actually deal with,” Mooldijk said.“But the bigger (effect) is even on the investments. Does it change the business climate and the supply-demand balance to the extent that—a little bit cheaper or a little bit more expensive project, doesn't really matter—do we want to do it or not,” he added, as quoted by ET.He noted that Shell’s global chemicals business has seen demand impacts, with the speed of recovery remaining uncertain.Shell continues to face low oil prices, with crude trading below $70 per barrel and forecasts predicting sub-$60 levels next year due to a supply glut.“We have an incredibly resilient upstream portfolio,” Mooldijk said. “So, while (low oil price) hurts, it doesn't hurt fundamentally at that level where we have to disappoint shareholders.”In India, Shell operates an LNG terminal in Gujarat, a small fuel retail chain, and the renewable energy platform Sprng Energy. Most of its 13,000 Indian employees work in Global Capability Centres (GCC) in Chennai and Bengaluru.Chennai hosts Shell’s global monitoring centre for assets worldwide.“(It) allows us to optimize across different assets. Because typically if assets are on a different continent, they don't really talk to each other. But now you see that there's similar work done by people sitting next to each other for different assets,” Mooldijk said.Bengaluru houses one of Shell’s three key global R&D hubs. “Bangalore for me is probably the key to commercialisation of technology,” he added, highlighting Shell’s Changemakers of Tomorrow initiative, which brings together startups, academics, suppliers, and industry executives to foster energy innovation.Mooldijk emphasised that Shell’s India presence is no longer just about cost efficiency.“It may have started off a long time ago as cost efficiency. We're so way beyond that. We reached the point that we cannot do without our presence in India and the same applies to our IT organisation,” he said, as quoted by ET.Shell is collaborating with Indian universities and suppliers to develop frugal technologies that enhance competitiveness.While some global oil companies have scaled back renewable ambitions due to market challenges, Shell continues to develop technology for sustainable energy.“It's the market that drives how fast we go. The will is there and especially on technology development, we will continue to develop, but we still need to have a market,” Mooldijk said. “If nobody buys it, what are you going to do with it?”On green hydrogen, he cautioned that price parity with conventional hydrogen is unlikely this decade.“It currently costs about five times more and would require fundamental technological breakthroughs to achieve a steep cost reduction,” Mooldijk added.","US President Donald Trump’s tariffs are creating uncertainty into the global economy. “The primary effect is on our supply chain.

Mixed signals from Federal Reserve



Currency and commodity markets







Asian share markets looked set to extend recent gains on Tuesday, driven by strong investor optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and tech stocks, while bets on further US interest rate cuts pushed gold to fresh record levels.Wall Street had reached another record after Nvidia announced it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the first data centre equipment expected in the second half of 2026.""With US tech/AI currently in red-hot form, we'd need to see something leftfield to derail the upbeat flows that are the driving force of Oracle, Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, and some of the US hardware plays,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone, as quoted by Reuters.Weston noted that the seemingly inexorable rise in tech has been attracting money from momentum funds and options traders, becoming almost self-fulfilling. Investors are also hedging their exposure to equities by buying gold, which hit a fresh record of $3,755.47 per ounce, up nearly 9% so far this month.The tech rally has boosted chip sectors across Asia. South Korean stocks rose 0.2%, having surged almost 9% this month, while Taiwan climbed nearly 7%.Japan’s Nikkei was closed for a holiday but has risen 6.5% in September. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3%, up 5.5% for the month. Chinese blue chips edged up 0.1%.European equities have generally lagged behind the tech surge. EUROSTOXX 50 futures gained 0.1%, FTSE futures rose 0.1%, and DAX futures added 0.2%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were largely unchanged after reaching new peaks overnight.Equities globally have been underpinned by expectations of further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve following last week's easing. Futures indicate roughly a 90% chance of a quarter-point cut in October and a 75% probability of another cut in December.Markets remain dovish despite mixed messaging from the Fed. Speaking on Monday, new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, handpicked by US President Donald Trump, argued for sharply lower rates, while three colleagues stressed the need for caution on inflation. Fed chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later Tuesday on the economic outlook and policy.Treasuries have also been supported by expectations of lower short-term rates, even as markets brace for a large government and corporate debt issuance this week: $69 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday, followed by $70 billion in five-year notes and $44 billion in seven-year paper. Investors are also watching the September 30 US government funding deadline.In currencies, the dollar eased after three consecutive sessions of gains. The euro remained steady at $1.1809, rebounding from a $1.1726 low on Monday, while the dollar slipped to 147.68 yen from a high of 148.37. Sweden’s crown held at 9.3497 per dollar ahead of a central bank meeting, where futures imply about a one-in-three chance of a rate cut.Oil prices were restrained as concerns of oversupply outweighed geopolitical tensions in Russia and the Middle East. Brent crude eased 0.2% to $66.46 a barrel, while US crude dipped 0.1% to $62.21 per barrel.","Asian share markets look set to extend recent gains, driven by strong investor optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and tech stocks.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

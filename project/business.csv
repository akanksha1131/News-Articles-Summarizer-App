Global submarine fibre cable projects

Global tech giants Google and Meta are making substantial investments in submarine fibre cables connecting to India. This strategic move positions them in direct competition with established domestic data providers Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel and Tata Communications during a period of significant data centre expansion.Industry experts indicate that neutral infrastructure providers like Sify Technologies and Lightstorm are gaining prominence by offering more cost-effective landing facilities compared to established telecom operators Airtel and Tata Communications.Sources familiar with the project told ET that Google plans to launch its Blue-Raman Submarine Cable System in Mumbai during the first quarter of 2025.The Blue and Raman project, valued at $400 million with 218-Tbps capacity, includes investment from Italian firm Sparkle. This addition brings Google's global subsea cable investments to 18.Meta's plans include developing a substantial subsea cable with 500-Tbps capacity, requiring $10 billion in investment over three years. India, being a crucial market for consumer and enterprise AI, features prominently in Meta's cable routing strategy.Also Read | High-speed 280 kmph trains soon!

""India clearly stands at a vantage point to seize those opportunities.""Sources close to the matter indicate Meta's cable might connect either in Gujarat, where its partner Reliance Industries is constructing India's largest AI data centre at 1 Gigawatt, or in Chennai, where Reliance's joint venture already operates a data centre.A landing station serves as a compact data centre facility linking submarine cable networks to land-based infrastructure.Between October and March next year, Jio and Airtel plan to launch three major submarine cable initiatives - 2Africa Pearls, India-Asia-Express (IAX) and India-Europe-Express (IEX) - which will increase current capacity by more than fourfold.The competition centres on India's profitable market for undersea optical fibre pairs that enable global high-speed data transmission. Whilst Airtel and Tata Communications currently lead this sector, Jio, despite being relatively new, is actively pursuing opportunities amidst growing data demands.Also Read | This billionaire American CEO thinks you may work just 3.5 days a week in future Trai reports indicate the global submarine communications cables market is projected to grow from $27.57 billion in 2023 to $40.58 billion by 2028, with a 7.2% annual increase. Within Asia Pacific, India's market shows the strongest growth trajectory, expected to reach $78.6 million by 2030. This growth is driven by rising data sovereignty requirements, security considerations, and increasing data centre operations within India.Government regulations restrict submarine cable operations in India to specific entities. Only those holding international long distance (ILD) and internet service provider (ISP)-A telecom licences are authorised to manage and operate cable landing stations (CLS).","Google plans to launch its Blue-Raman Submarine Cable System in Mumbai during the first quarter of 2025.

SBI customers take note of new scam! Imposters extorting money with these 7 steps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-customers-take-note-of-new-scam-imposters-extorting-money-with-these-7-steps/articleshow/115962047.cms,"Always authenticate the identity of the caller or sender. Legitimate organizations generally do not request sensitive information.

How the CBI, I-T imposter scam operates:

The first step to prevent falling prey to such frauds is to understand the modus operandi of scamsters. Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services told ET explains how the fraud works:

Initiating the contact: The whole process begins with an imposter identifying any exploitable customer and contacting him/her through voice or video call, usually over messenger apps. The key element of the fraud is the bait that tricks the victim into believing the official has some critical information about them. This bait may include personal information like KYC number, address or any other information like assets etc.

Convincing the victim: The imposter then uses this information in such a way that the victim gets easily convinced. For example telling them about any property they bought and not paying the required tax for it. The fraudster may obtain this information from property websites where you have listed details, from a property broker’s website, or even from a data breach at the property registrar's office.

Narrating a fake story: Once the victim is convinced that the imposter is a genuine CBI or income tax official, the fraudster fabricates a story, claiming that the victim has evaded taxes or missed an important legal process, and therefore faces the possibility of arrest.

Falling into the trap: Hearing words like ""jail,"" ""arrest,"" and ""legal proceedings"" naturally triggers a sense of panic in people. The fraudster exploits this fear and panic to manipulate the victim into compliance.

Staging fake evidence: Meanwhile, the fraudster further ""stages"" the situation by scrutinizing fake documents and, in some cases, even simulating a police interrogation, pressurizing the victim into providing additional personal information, such as Aadhaar details, bank account numbers, and other sensitive data. This is then used by the scammers to easily access the victim’s bank account and other details.

Last nail in the coffin: The fraudster sets a well-planned trap that deceives numerous victims and once the victim believes the investigation will be lengthy, the fraudsters offer an escape route to the victim claiming that their innocence can only be confirmed after thorough verification. The victim is assured that the ‘official’ will take care of all legal, tax, and other issues, provided that the victim pays them a bribe and directs them to transfer money to multiple bank accounts throughout the investigation, with the promise that the funds will be refunded once the inquiry is completed.

How to avoid these frauds

Social engineering

Steps to prevent online frauds

Always authenticate the identity of the caller or sender. Legitimate organizations generally do not request sensitive information through phone calls, SMS, or video calls. Be cautious if someone threatens you with legal action or fines as genuine organizations typically communicate through official channels, allowing sufficient time for the victim to respond. Never share personal or financial information with anyone who contacts you unexpectedly. Report any suspicious messages to your bank and local law enforcement authorities. Enable security features such as two-factor authentication on your bank accounts and use strong, unique passwords for each service.

Various studies indicate that billions of dollars are lost annually worldwide due to different types of financial fraud, and the problem is escalating as technology evolves and more people conduct transactions online,” she said.“If it's a genuine call then the other person will agree to meet you at the police station or government office.”Another tip she suggested was for consumers to disconnect the call and then dial the same number to return the call.""This is because, in our experience, we have seen these impostors use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) or other internet-based calling software, which typically doesn't allow incoming calls.""Also Read | Aadhaar card update: Deadline to update your Aadhaar details for free is approaching - here’s what you need to know Bharadwaj also shared some essential tips to safeguard and avoid this fraud",The State Bank of India has warned its customers about a new series of scams where imposters posing as CBI or Income Tax Department officials threaten people with a made up supposed legal action.

Billionaire Poonawalla’s lender to double staff in growth blitz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/billionaire-poonawallas-lender-to-double-staff-in-growth-blitz/articleshow/115990165.cms,"Poonawalla Fincorp Ltd aims to double its headcount as the Indian shadow bank expands into new product lines to increase assets to 1.5 trillion rupees ($17.7 billion) in the next five years.The non-bank finance company controlled by billionaire Adar Poonawalla , plans to add six retail-focused lending businesses in the next four to six quarters, on top of its existing portfolio, according to Chief Executive Officer Arvind Kapil.The new businesses include loans for gold purchases, used cars, shopkeepers and education, according to Kapil, who took over the top job in June. The company plans to add nearly 400 branches by next year, up from roughly 100. It will tap into the demand for loans against gold, in smaller cities through a mix of digital offerings and physical branches, Kapil said.Poonawalla Fincorp is expanding even as credit growth slows and the Reserve Bank of India steps up scrutiny of the shadow bank sector by raising provisions to reduce risk. Poonawalla’s stock tumbled in October after it reported higher provisions for bad loans and saw an increase in operating costs in the latest quarter.Credit Growth has slowed sharply in India this year |Kapil expects operating costs will come down by the end of the fiscal year, especially relative to assets, as the lender expands into new markets. The wider array of business lines will also reduce risk, he added.“If you want to create a solid franchise with very strong foundation, I think it’s important to have nine to 10 retail-focused products which target diversified customer segments so you can actually lower the risk,” Kapil said. The firm will focus on lending to salaried employees at India’s top 300 companies.Kapil, who most recently led the mortgages business at HDFC Bank Ltd., has spent the last six months setting up his core management team, which includes unit heads from his former bank, along with Yes Bank Ltd. and others.“The seasoned team has experience of building out large businesses and running them,” Kapil said, adding that he expects headcount to double from 2,500 employees over the next three quarters as the lender implements the new strategy.Shadow lender stocks have underperformed index this yearPoonawalla’s stock has largely recovered from the earnings hit, which Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. called a “kitchen sink” quarter under the new management team.The analysts called the pace of change “too fast and furious,” and the lender could see a compression in margins and elevated operating costs for the next few quarters. Still, the steps were “in the right direction to make the franchise stronger,” Motilal Oswal said, maintaining its buy rating on the stock.The shadow lender is also evaluating setting up a wealth business, Kapil said. Poonawalla will first look at distributing third-party investment products through its network and then explore producing its own, Kapil added.The firm, rebranded from Magma Fincorp Ltd. after Poonawalla bought it in 2021, is open to more acquisitions, he added. “In the short and medium term however, we plan to grow this business organically,” he said.The Poonawalla group became a household name in India during the pandemic. Their company, Serum Institute of India, is the largest vaccine maker in the world and became one of the top manufacturers of the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine and a supplier to Covax, the World Health Organization-backed initiative to ensure an equitable global roll-out.“The Poonawalla name is probably synonymous with trust in saving lives in almost every home today,” Kapil said. “As a finance company, we’ve got a great opportunity to build on that trust and capitalize on it on a granular scale, especially on the retail lending side.”","Poonawalla Fincorp Ltd aims to double its headcount as the Indian shadow bank expands into new product lines.

Arguing against the proposal, EEPC India chairman Pankaj Chadha said the duty, which can be imposed in emergency situations, was unjustified as it will push up prices by 20-25% as domestic prices are always linked to the landed price.He said that due to freight and port handling charges, imports from Asean countries are suffering a 12.5% price disadvantage, which goes up to 20% in case of Chinese steel as they also face import duty.

However, fraudsters exploited this feature by picking up some of the cash, causing the machine logs to record a cash retraction. Disabling this feature put an end to such frauds.However, in the past year, a different fraud has emerged. The fake shutter overlay fraud involves criminals attaching a fake cover over the ATM's cash dispensing slot, which traps the dispensed cash. Fraudsters then retrieve the cash after the customer leaves thinking the transaction has failed. By re-enabling cash retraction, customers have a better chance of retrieving their cash if the machine is targeted by fraudsters.NPCI, in a letter to all members of the National Financial Switch , which manages India's ATM network, stated that after discussing solutions to the fake shutter overlay fraud, industry members, banks and ATM companies, submitted their recommendations, which were passed on to RBI.Bankers said that the retraction facility will be introduced only in those ATMs that are susceptible to fraud.",Cash retraction facility refers to the built-in feature in ATMs where the machine pulls back currency notes if the customer does not collect them from the dispenser in time.

Climate risks have hit financial system: RBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/climate-risks-have-hit-financial-system-rbi/articleshow/115984070.cms,"MUMBAI: Climate risks have started to impact the financial system and could pose systemic problems in future, according to RBI.Besides damage to assets, risks include business disruption, increase in loan losses, and transition risks arising from the shift to a low-carbon economy, which create uncertainty for firms and investors.Speaking at a conference organised by the National University of Singapore in New Delhi, RBI deputy governor Rajeshwar Rao said there are two main types of climate-related risks - physical risks from climate events and transition risks associated with shifting to a low-carbon economy. He highlighted data challenges in assessing climate risks, including a lack of uniform methodologies, fragmented accessibility, and absence of historical loan loss data. ""We are yet to comprehensively assess climate risks due to data issues. These include fragmented accessibility, differing metrics, and a lack of historical loan loss data and hazard forecasts.""Rao said that tapping into the global pool of private funds for climate finance was a challenge for India because of data gaps, technical limitations and institutional constraints in setting projects that help cope with the impact of climate change. ""While transitioning is crucial, we cannot overlook the immediate impact of climate events. We also need to look at adaptation measures, which currently appear to be a missing link in climate strategies,"" Rao said.Unlike mitigation projects - which focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow climate change - adaptation projects aim to minimise the risks and damages caused by climate-related events such as extreme weather, rising sea levels, and changing rainfall patterns. Rao added that there was an urgent need for the financial system to address climate risks and play a catalytic role in overcoming related challenges. He stressed on taking collective action to mitigate increasing climate risks, highlighting their significant impact on the economy, society, and financial stability.","RBI deputy governor Rajeshwar Rao said there are two main types of climate- related risks.

The company drove in the next-gen version of Amaze entry sedan, priced between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 10.9 lakh (ex-showroom), to take onMaruti’s newly-upgraded Dzire.Honda, which has been working to revive its fortunes in India after it got moderate response to its Elevate mid-sized SUV due to stiff competition from the formidable Korean duo of Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos, plans to drive in pure electrics and hybrids from 2026-27 onwards, company president & CEO Takuya Tsumura said.With the new-designed Amaze, which is in its third-generation now, the company is hoping to grab customers of hatchbacks as well as mini SUVs within its fold. “We sold 5.8 lakh units of the previous generations of Amaze, and are confident that the new version will help us grow our numbers and market share further,” Tsumura said.The company is banking on the Amaze and old warhorse, the City premium sedan, to keep up the momentum in the market till it begins to introduce all-new products from 2026-27 when it drives in its first fully-electric SUV, apart from two additional ‘electrified’ models which are likely to be strong hybrids. “Our future line-up will be mainly of hybrids and pure electrics,” the company CEO said.Honda’s domestic sales are likely to be flat in 2024 at around 87,000 units as the company suffers from lack of options in SUVs, or other premium flagship models. The company had decided to phase out models such as the Civic sedan and the CR-V bigger SUV after an unsatisfactory performance in the domestic market.Tsumura said the govt should look at providing benefits to hybrids which – at around 43% -- are currently taxed much higher than the 5% GST fixed for electrics. “The taxation should come down. If we get something between pure ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles and electrics, it will be good.”The company has also been exporting cars to maintain economies of scale at its India factory which is located in Rajasthan.","The company drove in the next-gen version of Amaze entry sedan, priced between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 10.9 lakh (ex-showroom) The company is banking on the Amaze and old warhorse, the City premium sedan, to keep up the momentum in the market.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115980641,imgsize-1216195,width-400,resizemode-4/115980641.jpg"

The Department of Telecom has sought recommendations of Trai on terms and conditions of spectrum assignment including spectrum pricing in respect of licensees intending to provide satellite-based communication services while accounting for level playing field with terrestrial access services,” Minister of State for Telecom Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar said in Lok Sabha.Sekhar also said that security-related restrictions and checks are in place to ensure that satcom services are not used by non-state actors or hostile nations against India. “DoT grants authorisations under Unified License (UL) for providing satellite-based commercial communication services. Satellite-based communication licenses are granted to any applicant, subject to acceptance and in compliance of the applicable licensing terms and conditions, including security conditions of India.”Terrestrial network providers have been demanding that govt provide spectrum to satcom players only through auctions, a route which is mandated for them. This when the govt had decided to do away with auctions for satellite players with the new telecom law providing for administrative allocation, but at a pre-announced pricing.Starlink’s application has been pending with govt for over two years, and the key concerns are around security-related issues. Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said last month that the govt is “more than happy” to see Starlink enter India, but after complying with the mandated procedures and conditions, including addressing “security concerns” raised by the authorities.“They have to comply with all the conditions. So, you have to look at it from a security perspective, from making sure that all the security concerns are addressed. So, when they do that, then we'll be more than happy to give it (approval),” the Minister — who has also emphasised that satcom companies don’t need to go through spectrum auctions — had said.On whether govt has any specific concerns regarding the application filed by the American company, he said, “Let me repeat. There is a specific format. You need to check all the boxes, right? When you've checked all the boxes, you'll get the license. There's no if, but, why, when, and right.”",Starlink’s application has been pending with govt for over two years. The key concerns are around security-related issues.

Israeli response and ongoing negotiations

Devastating toll of war

President-elect Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas on Monday, demanding the immediate release of hostages held in Gaza.Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump stated that if the hostages were not freed before his inauguration on January 20, 2025, there would be ""all hell to pay"" in the Middle East.“Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it’s all talk, and no action! Please let this Truth serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be all hell to pay in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity”, he wrote.""Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied history of the United States of America. Release the hostages now!,"" he added, calling for the immediate release of those still in captivity.This marks Trump’s most direct comments on the issue since his election in November.According to Israeli officials, over 250 hostages were taken during Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023. Of these, approximately 100 remain in captivity, with some confirmed dead, reported the news agency Reuters.The assault, which left 1,200 dead, is considered the deadliest in Israel's history.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or his office has not commented on Trump’s statement as of now. However, President Isaac Herzog expressed gratitude, posting on X, ""Thank you and bless you, Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump. We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!""Hamas has reportedly linked any release of hostages to an end to Israel’s military operations in Gaza and a complete withdrawal from the territory.The Biden administration has engaged in extensive diplomacy, brokering a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but Hamas has shown little willingness to negotiate for a broader peace deal, according to US officials cited by news agency AP.The conflict, which began with Hamas’ surprise attack, has devastated Gaza.As per Reuters, Israeli airstrikes have killed over 44,400 Palestinians, with nearly 90 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents displaced, as per the territory’s health ministry. The war has also levelled significant portions of the enclave.Trump’s threats came just hours after Israel confirmed the death of Omer Neutra, a dual US-Israeli citizen, whose remains are believed to still be in Gaza.Meanwhile, Hamas released a video of Edan Alexander, an Israeli soldier held hostage, urging Trump to secure the freedom of those captured.Trump’s allies hope for a hostage release deal before his return to office, but the situation remains tense, with both Israel and Hamas showing no signs of compromise.","US President-elect Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas on Monday, demanding the immediate release of hostages held in Gaza.

As crypto is firmly in bull market territory, now is the time to stack up on altcoins. A new project, Cutoshi, currently in presale, is gaining a lot of traction.Bitcoin has essentially been adopted by mainstream finance, meaning that it will not go to 0, despite the 477 ‘Bitcoin obituaries’ in the past. Many ‘experts’ are now publishing articles about why they were wrong about BTC.As long as the bull market continues, BTC should keep going up, but it will be outperformed by many smaller-cap coins.Considering that Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has had a Spot ETF, the price action this year has been disappointing. As Bitcoin makes all-time highs, ETH is struggling to get close to its ATH of $4,878, and is currently trading at around $3,451.According to DeFiLlama, over 63% of all decentralized finance and money locked (TVL) is stored on Ethereum. Many Layer 2 blockchains are built upon it that use ETH as a gas token, such as Arbitrum.With the new pro-crypto administration coming in, it looks as though the issue of ETH being a potential security is over. Another benefit is that ETH staking rewards can potentially be integrated into the ETF returns, making Ethereum Spot ETFs more attractive for institutional investors.Known as the Ethereum killer, Solana is considered to be Etheruem’s rival. It’s built with a different coding language and offers fast speeds and low fees. Solana became the chain of choice for many meme coins since the launch of the easy-to-use meme coin deployer Pump.fun.Solana is likely to be the next coin to receive a Spot ETF, with applications from asset managers Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital.If Solana can grow as big as ETH is now, then that's room for 3.74x growth, as we can see from the picture below:Image from MarketCapOf If Solana grows as big as ETH did in the last bull run, that's a SOL price of $1,205.26 (5.15x).While the previous coins are the three biggest in all crypto, in terms of market cap and overall adoption, every portfolio, especially a crypto one, needs a small-cap coin with a lot of potential.Cutoshi is a cat-based meme coin with a devoted community. Cutoshi is also a DeFi ecosystem in the making, giving it long-term use cases and functionality. Currently building a P2P and cross-chain DEX to make DeFi more simple, teaching people how to use DeFi through a fun learning space and offering people the ability to do yield farming and more.Cutoshi is in the third stage of its presale, soon to move to stage four, with over $1.1 million raised already.To put the opportunity in context, let's compare it to one of the most successful memecoins that also does DeFi - Shiba Inu.Image from MarketCapOf As we can see, if CUTO can reach the size of SHIB, that’s an amazing 1271.35x. CUTO, which is currently on sale for $0.0259, could be worth close to $33 dollars in the long term.For more information on the Cutoshi (CUTO) Presale:Email: alex@cutoshi.com Join and become a community member:","As crypto is firmly in bull market territory, now is the time to stack up on altcoins.

After the U.S. Election Day on November 5, Ripple's XRP has been causing waves in the crypto market with an amazing price rise. At $1.89 right now, XRP has tripled from its pre-election value. Today's major question– how high can XRP go before Trump's inauguration in January? The market is responding favorably to the political and legal changes linked to his presidency.The cryptocurrency market depends on sentiment, speculation, and legislative changes– all of which have driven XRP's recent price surge. Since November 5, the coin has profited from growing investor confidence, most likely inspired by Donald Trump's triumph and the expected legislative change supporting digital assets. XRP has tripled its value in less than a month, providing strong upward momentum. The announced departure of Gary Gensler, the SEC Chair, set for Trump's inauguration day, is a major component driving this surge. Particularly for currencies like XRP that have been under regulatory scrutiny in the past, Gensler's leaving is a positive development for the cryptocurrency scene. Gensler's resignation has market players looking forward to a softer regulatory environment under the next government.Market experts are positive regarding XRP's future for even more expansion before Trump's inauguration. Some forecasts indicate XRP might surpass the $5 level, particularly if the present positive attitude continues. Strong technical indications, past trends, and rising trade volumes are our estimate's foundation. More speculative predictions, though, have XRP rising to $15 following the inauguration. Although these forecasts are interesting, they are somewhat speculative and depend on several elements, including regulation changes, more general market trends, and Ripple's capacity to find new alliances or increase its usage. Rexas Finance (RXS) is another coin quietly taking the front stage as XRP rides the wave of optimistic feelings. With its real-world asset tokenizing features, RXS is emerging as a revolutionary force in the crypto sector. It is primed to soar even bigger than XRP before Trump's inauguration.With just one click, Rexas Finance lets consumers purchase, sell, and fractionalize real-world assets, including real estate, artwork, and intellectual property. This special use case makes RXS a game-changer since it provides countless options for investors looking for exposure to real assets in the digital environment. As of writing, Rexas Finance (RXS) is priced at $0.10 and has already raised an outstanding $19.95 million. It is currently in its eighth presale round. The coin's presale has shown amazing enthusiasm; its price has tripled from the first stage. This path reflects the recent performance of XRP, but with a major difference: RXS is still in its presale phase, so it has great growth capacity.With a stunning 19,900% return from its present price, top market analysts estimate RXS might surge to $20 before Trump takes office. With this expansion far higher than XRP's possible returns, RXS appeals to investors trying to profit from the continuous crypto surge. Rexas Finance represents a revolution and is not only a symbol. With unparalleled access and flexibility, the platform lets consumers tokenize almost any real-world asset. From anywhere globally, RXS lets everyone engage in the tokenized economy, whether their participation is full ownership or fractional investment.Although the recent price surge of XRP has made news, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a convincing substitute with better profits. Although XRP gains from market mood and regulatory confidence, its rise is mostly related to macroeconomic events and Ripple's continuous legal conflicts. By merging blockchain technology with actual asset tokenization, RXS offers a fresh horizon in cryptocurrencies. Its ambitious roadmap and presale success suggest that it may outpace XRP in terms of acceptance and expansion. With forecasts of a 19,900% increase before Trump's inauguration, RXS offers early investors potentially life-changing rewards.In conclusion, XRP and Rexas Finance (RXS) are among the best candidates as the crypto market moves into a new phase of hope and possibilities. XRP’s price surge reflects renewed investor confidence and regulatory optimism, while RXS offers a groundbreaking use case with unparalleled growth potential. XRP provides a relatively stable option with strong market momentum, while RXS offers the chance to get in on the ground floor of a revolutionary project poised for exponential growth.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Win $1 Million Giveaway: https://bit.ly/Rexas1M Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance","Ripple's XRP has been causing waves in the crypto market with an amazing price rise.

Worst airlines in the world

Best airlines in the world

The Sunday after Thanksgiving weekend marked a fresh record for US air travel with the Transportation Security Administration screening more than 3 million passengers in a single day. That doesn’t mean everything went smoothly, of course.AirHelp Inc., which facilitates compensation for passengers by processing customer service claims for flight disruptions and lost luggage, has released its annual analysis of the best and worst performing airlines. The 2024 AirHelp Score report , published on Tuesday, comes just in time for the holiday season.The airline rankings methodology takes into account customer claims processed worldwide, as well as outside data tracking on-time arrival and departure performance for every plane, plus feedback from passengers from over 54 countries on the quality of food, comfort and crew service on their most recent flight. The aim is to give a snapshot of airline performance, says AirHelp Chief Executive Officer Tomasz Pawliszyn, with hope that the analysis “encourages airlines to continuously listen to passenger feedback.” Data analyzed for this round spanned from January through October.The worst performing airline in the world? That’s Tunisair, coming in last at No. 109. Keeping it company in the bottom 10 are a handful of national and low-cost carriers, including Buzz, a Polish airline that is a subsidiary of Ryanair Holdings PLC, Bulgaria Air, Turkish carrier Pegasus Airlines and Air Mauritius. But ranking in the bottom 50, too, are North American carriers JetBlue and Air Canada.Sort the results based solely on customer opinion and Tunisair keeps the title of the worst performing, followed closely by Ryanair and Aer Lingus, a subsidiary of IAG SA, which also owns British Airways and Iberia.As for the best all-around airline globally: It’s Brussels Airlines, part of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, bumping Qatar Airways to No. 2 after holding the top spot since 2018. That’s a marked improvement for the Belgian national airline that was rated No. 12 last year.Both United Airlines and American Airlines ranked in the top five, in third and fourth place respectively, which might come as a surprise to US travelers given the flight disruptions which plagued domestic airlines this past year. Both have consistently ranked in AirHelp’s top 10 since at least 2022.“We also had a new North American nominee come through this year, Air Transat, the Canadian airline was ranked in position 36,” notes Pawliszyn. Delta Air Lines dropped to No. 17 from No. 11 in 2023, which Pawliszyn explains is due to a reduction in its claim processing score, while its on-time performance and customer opinion rankings haven’t shifted much. The airline’s July tech outage led to more than 3,000 complaints being filed about Delta with the Department of Transportation.Alaska Airlines, due to merge with Hawaiian Holdings Inc., also dropped more than 30 spots to No. 88 this year.100.

Retailers have been strategizing to pull in US shoppers with notifications, mails and other heavily touted ads.With a little more than three weeks before Christmas, experts say this year's discounts have been steeper, as shoppers are holding out for days packed with promotions. Retail chain Target, announced a ""two-day Cyber Monday"" starting on Sunday, offering 50 per cent discount off thousands of items that included video games, home decor and other technology.According to preliminary estimates from payments processor Mastercard, sales at brick-and-mortar stores on Friday increased by only 0.7 per cent compared to last year. Meanwhile, data firm Facteus reported that sales were actually down.In order to make it easier to help shoppers find their products on websites and mobile apps, Amazon, Walmart and other online retailers relied on generative AI customer service and search features. Cheyenne Berens, a 29-year-old resident of Pittsburgh, also used Amazon’s generative AI chatbot services to track price of merchandise, as quoted by Reuters.""I have found that using Rufus on Amazon has been extremely helpful in determining whether a 'deal' is actually a 'deal',"" Berens said.Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce which is a cloud computing company that monitors global shopping data from over 1.5 billion consumers, explained that GenAI tools, like chatbots that handle basic queries from online shoppers about products, have helped retailers safeguard their profit margins despite increasing costs.He also noted that, according to Salesforce estimates, retailers who utilized GenAI tools for customer service experienced a 15 per cent higher purchase rate among users on Saturday. Schwartz said that the higher conversion rate acted as “a game changer.”According to preliminary estimates from Adobe Inc., online spending in the United States on Monday is projected to hit $13.2 billion, a 6 per cent increase from Cyber Monday last year. This follows the approximately $10.8 billion Americans spent online on Black Friday, as reported by Adobe.Adobe reported that traffic to retail sites from chatbots or shoppers clicking on website links increased by 1,800 per cent from Black Friday through the weekendWith many Americans taking on more debt, most are turning to third-party 'buy now, pay later' services, and spending on these services is expected to reach $1 billion, according to Adobe projections. Adobe tracks devices using its software, which powers over 1 trillion visits to US retail sites.","Retailers have been strategizing to pull in US shoppers with notifications, mails and other heavily touted ads.

Rupee falls to record low on Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on BRICS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rupee-falls-to-record-low-on-trumps-threat-of-100-tariffs-on-brics/articleshow/115913935.cms,".

MUMBAI: The rupee fell to a record low of 84.73 against the dollar on Monday, weakening 0.2% for its worst single-day decline since June 4. It touched an intraday low of 84.73 before closing at 84.70 - 14 paise weaker than Friday's close. This was driven by strong dollar demand in the non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets after weaker-than-expected Q2 growth numbers. RBI intervention , however, has helped limit further losses.Recently, global factors have compounded the rupee's woes. The dollar's strong performance also follows US President-elect Donald Trump's recent warnings to BRICS nations against creating an alternative to the dollar, and threatening 100% tariffs. This geopolitical tension - coupled with potential Chinese retaliation by devaluing the yuan - has intensified market uncertainty. Analysts predict continued FII outflows amid these challenges.""It is no longer just macroeconomic factors that are determining the value of the rupee... it is more of geopolitics and the new US administration's stance on trade. Trump's warning to BRICS to impose 100% tariff if an alternative arrangement to the dollar if pursued may have an impact on the rupee,"" Ashhish Vaidya, head of treasury at DBS Bank, said.Traders foresee the rupee trading between 84.50 and 84.95 in the near term, with crude oil recovery posing additional risks. However, positive domestic market trends may provide some support. ""It is difficult to forecast a level for the rupee. It is not a long way from 85. The question is how far can it go? The double whammy for India would be a stronger dollar and a reduction in govt spending in the US, which could create pressure on most other currencies. Once the new administration in the US is in place and announces some of its policies, it will give the market some sense of direction,"" Vaidya added.","The rupee fell to a record low of 84.73 against the dollar on Monday, weakening 0.2% for its worst single-day decline since June 4.

Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares on Sunday resigned ""with immediate effect"", the auto giant announced, signalling differences over how to confront the group's profit slump.The Italian-US-French company, whose 14 brands include Fiat, Peugeot-Citroen, Opel, Maserati, Chrysler, Ram and Jeep, said in a statement that the board had accepted the resignation of the 66-year-old Portuguese executive.""In recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the CEO coming to today's decision,"" independent director Henri de Castries said in the statement, without giving details.The group said in September that it had started looking for a successor for Tavares, who had been due to stand down when his current five-year contract ends in early 2026.""The process to appoint the new permanent chief executive officer is well under way, managed by a special committee of the board, and will be concluded within the first half of 2025,"" said the statement.It added that an ""interim executive committee"" led by chairman John Elkann will run the company until then.Stellantis has reported growing difficulties in recent months that Tavares had acknowledged as stormy. Several model launches were delayed because of electrical problems.Elkann has dismissed any further merger with another group, while Tavares had hinted that the door was open for a deal.A Stellantis earnings report in July said sales in North America, the main profit source, were down 18 percent in the first six months.It later cut its profit forecast and said third-quarter sales in North America were down 20 percent on the 2023 figure.Like other auto groups, Stellantis has blamed competition from China and the difficult transition to electric cars for much of its troubles.Tavares started his career in the car industry with Renault before becoming chief executive of the old Peugeot-Citroen (PSA) group in 2014, where he made his name as a cost-cutter and guided the French group's merger with Germany's Opel.A collector of vintage racing cars, Tavares was made chief executive of Stellantis when PSA and Fiat-Chrysler merged in 2021 to form the new group.At the start it made impressive profits and invested quickly in electric and hybrid vehicles. A shortage of computer chips meant there were shortages that allowed carmakers to charge high prices.The market has since stabilised at lower prices and the storm clouds started gathering with this year's profit figures.In September Tavares had to abandon his aim of double-digit profit margins for the year that had partly been used to justify his 36.5 million euro ($38.6 million) salary for 2023.The Stellantis statement confirmed the forecast made in October of profit margins between 5.5% and 7.0% of turnover.Production cuts in several factories have worried workers and governments. In October, thousands staged demonstrations against reduced Fiat production in Italy. The group has shifted production from Western Europe to lower-cost factories in countries like Turkey, Brazil, and Morocco.Tavares has since assured that the situation is improving in the United States and that Stellantis is not alone in facing challenges in Europe.Last week, the group announced the closure of a factory in Luton, England, resulting in the loss of 1,100 jobs. While production has been reduced in France, the company has pledged not to shut down any factories there.","Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares resigns ""with immediate effect"" Tavares made his name as a cost-cutter and guided PSA's merger with Opel.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

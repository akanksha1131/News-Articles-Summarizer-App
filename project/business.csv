US Aviation Explodes: 1400+ Flights GROUNDED, Americans TRAPPED At Airports Amid Shutdown Crisis





Air travel across the United States could soon “slow to a trickle”, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Sunday, as the prolonged government shutdown continues to paralyse operations and disrupt flight schedules nationwide, AFP reported.Thousands of flights were cancelled or delayed through the weekend as the Trump administration ordered capacity cuts at 40 airports to ease pressure on air traffic controllers, many of whom have been working without pay since federal funding lapsed on October 1.“Air travel is going to slow to a trickle as everyone wants to travel to see their families,” Duffy told Fox News Sunday, cautioning that the impact will worsen as the Thanksgiving holiday season approaches.The shutdown — now stretching into its sixth week — has forced federal agencies to a near standstill, with many government employees, including airport security and traffic control staff, either furloughed or working unpaid while the political standoff between Republicans and Democrats drags on.“We’re going to see very few air traffic controllers coming to work, which means only a handful of flights will take off and land,” Duffy said.“You’re going to have massive disruption and a lot of angry Americans.”Appearing later on CNN’s “State of the Union”, Duffy warned that the situation could deteriorate further if the budget impasse is not resolved soon.“It’s only going to get worse,” he said. “Many people are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights if this thing doesn’t open back up.”The continued shutdown has raised concerns among airlines and unions about passenger safety, scheduling bottlenecks, and economic losses, with analysts estimating billions of dollars in lost productivity across the aviation and tourism sectors.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said it is prioritising essential services, but widespread absenteeism among staff has already led to longer wait times, route delays, and reduced capacity.","Air travel across the United States could soon ‘slow to a trickle’, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Sunday.

Donald Trump tariffs hit Indian restaurants in New York,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariffs-hit-indian-restaurants-in-new-york-heres-whats-causing-misery/articleshow/125180372.cms,"AI image

Justice Thomas Throws Curveball At Dem Lawyer On Trump Tariffs: 'What About Embargoes?'





Indian restaurants in New York City, which have recently outshone their London counterparts and become favourites among Wall Street executives, are now facing mounting pressure from higher import costs after US President Donald Trump’s tariff moves.On July 31, Trump doubled tariffs on most Indian exports to 50%, a measure that took effect on August 27. Though the legality of the decision is currently being reviewed by the Supreme Court, the impact has already hit restaurants, grocers, and food manufacturers relying on Indian ingredients.Prices of essentials such as spices, basmati rice, pulses, and tea have surged, squeezing already thin profit margins.Chef Salil Mehta, who runs Kebab aur Sharab and other eateries under the Fungi Hospitality Group, was quoted by ET as saying that the price of a 40-pound basmati rice bag jumped from $30 to $45, while chilli powder now costs $10.50, up from $7.“People don’t mind paying $35 for pasta, but Indian food still carries the perception that it should be cheap,” he said.Mehta has raised entree prices by about $5 but admits that margins remain lower than before.At Lungi, chef-owner Albin Vincent is dealing with similar challenges. He said his ingredient costs have risen by around 25%, forcing him to reassess prices for dosas and biryanis, which currently remain under $28.“If we raise prices, we risk driving away customers who may already be sensitive to price increases,” Vincent said, as per ET.Passerine owner Maneesh Goyal said the cost of imported daal and ghee has climbed steeply, with a case of ghee rising from $150 to $220, a 46% increase.“As a new Indian restaurant, we don’t yet have the flexibility to increase prices,” he said.While JKS Restaurants’ CEO Pavan Pardasani said their new US outlets haven’t yet been affected, others, such as Chef Mohammad Tarique Khan of Hyderabadi Zaiqa, are struggling.“Rice costs have gone from $45 to $69 for a 25-lb bag,” Khan said, adding that he hasn’t raised menu prices since most of his customers are local residents and students.The problem isn’t limited to restaurants. As per ET, snack makers like Doosra’s founder Kartik Das have faced supply delays and inventory shortages. Das, who previously sourced ingredients such as boondi and amchur from India, said uncertainty over tariff rates has pushed him to find US suppliers.Similarly, Keya Wingfield, who runs Keya’s Snacks in Virginia, said tariffs on imported spices have been “astronomical.”A recent 200-pound air shipment incurred a $1,700 freight tariff, drastically inflating costs.“Money we could have used for advertising or deliveries has gone to tariffs,” she said.As Mehta summed up, “Margins are getting slimmer. The market will adjust eventually, but it’s going to be survival of the fittest.”","US President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on most Indian exports to 50%.

Asian equities climbed on Monday, supported by optimism that a US government shutdown may be avoided and recovering from last week’s concerns over AI valuations.Hong Kong's HSI climbed to 26,409, up 167 points or 0.64%. Kospi traded up 112 points or 2.8%, reaching 4,065. In Japan, Nikkei gained 490 points or 0.98% to stand at 50,766.Shanghai traded marginally higher, adding 2 points.Meanwhile, Shenzhen dipped 31 points to 13,372 at 8:40 AM IST.The US Senate moved closer to a vote on reopening the federal government on Sunday, following Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s remarks that bipartisan talks in the chamber have taken a positive turn.The shutdown has placed considerable strain on the US economy, with federal workers across airports, law enforcement, and the military going unpaid, while government reporting has been limited, leaving the central bank to operate with less visibility. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett warned that the nation’s fourth-quarter GDP could turn negative if the shutdown persists.Consumer sentiment data released on Friday highlighted growing concerns, showing a decline to near a three-and-a-half-year low in early November as households weighed the economic impact.Despite these challenges, overall risk appetite remained positive on Monday. European futures were notably higher, with EUROSTOXX 50 and DAX futures up 1.3% each, while South Korea’s Kospi surged 2%.US treasury yields edged upward, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising 3.5 basis points to 4.1278%, and the two-year yield increasing roughly 3 basis points to 3.5886%.In currency markets, the dollar recovered some ground from last week as investors weighed the economic outlook against expectations of a more hawkish Federal Reserve.","Hong Kong's HSI climbed to 26,409, up 167 points or 0.64%.

Nuvama maintained its buy rating on UPL with the target price upped to Rs 823 from Rs 808 earlier. Analysts said the company reported strong numbers for July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26) that led to higher outlook for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), with revenue guidance unchanged. They also said that inventory overhang has eased, and the company reported 10% volume growth in Q2FY26. UPL Corp and Advanta drove strong performance across growth engines. The company’s balance sheet has improved. Analysts also expect the company to outpace industry growth.Citigroup has a buy rating on Apollo Hospitals with the target price at Rs 9,330. Analysts said the company’s Q2FY26 numbers were in line with expectations with HealthCo delivering healthy margin expansion. They pointed out that its hospital business saw slight year-on-year (YoY) margin contraction, due to a high base.Goldman Sachs maintained its buy rating on Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals with the target price slightly lowered at Rs 330 from Rs 340 earlier. Analysts said that during Q2FY26, the company’s revenue was up 1% YOY, EBITDA was 18% below estimates while margin was down to 8.3%. Its lighting and butterfly segments improved, the electrical consumer durables (ECD) segment reported weak numbers due to lower table-pedestal-wall-mounted fans and appliances sales, and higher input costs.During the quarter the company also won two rooftop solar orders worth Rs 500 crore, marking entry into a new growth area, which is expected to be margin-neutral. Despite a soft quarter, risk-reward remains favourable. The stock is seen as one of the cheapest consumer durable plays among the stocks Goldman Sacks covers.Elara maintained its reduce rating on Alkyl Amines with the target price cut to Rs 1,825 from Rs 1,872 earlier. Analysts said the company’s volume growth was marginal in the April-Sept half year (HIFY26). The company also gave a subdued guidance amid weak demand, US sanctions, and Chinese competition. Currently the global methylamines market is in an oversupply zone, particularly in the EU while the domestic segment faces overcapacity. The company’s new product project to be commissioned in Q1FY27, with expected asset turnover of 1.5x. Also, anti-dumping duty on acetonitrile has yet to show full impact.Jefferies has a buy rating on Godrej Properties with the target price at Rs 3,000.

Co-leadership model in focus amid business complexities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/co-leadership-model-in-focus-amid-biz-complexities/articleshow/125212354.cms,"Representative image





NEW DELHI: Amid volatile geopolitics and rapid shifts in markets and technology, certain companies are evaluating the idea of two leaders sharing the corner office.Over the past few weeks, global firms, including Comcast, Oracle and Spotify, have announced transitions to co-CEO structures, while discussions have begun closer home on whether a dual leadership can help companies move faster, HR experts told TOI .A handful of companies in India are already testing the waters, largely in sectors where complexity and speed demand shared leadership — technology-enabled services, diversified groups, consulting, private equity and investment banking.Earlier in July, global PE firm L Catterton appointed Vikram Kumarswamy as India co-head alongside Anjana Sasidharan; Synergy Marine Group named Vikas Trivedi to jointly lead the company with Ajay Chaudhry; and Innotera elevated Avinash Kasinathan as group co-chief.“This trend is likely to grow manifold — perhaps five times over the next five years — because the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. With the CEO role becoming increasingly complex, it is no longer realistic to burden a single leader with everything an unpredictable world demands. A CEO today is expected to be an ace problem-solver, able to navigate disruption on multiple fronts. As a result, CEO tenures globally are shrinking and burnout is becoming more common.Under a co-leadership model, the load can be distributed more evenly, allowing companies to operate with greater resilience and efficiency,” said Ronesh Puri, MD, Executive Access India.Advocates of the model say shared leadership creates a natural system of checks and balances, reducing over-concentration of power and enabling more thoughtful, well-challenged decisions at the top. They add that for this to work smoothly, organisations must draw clear lines of authority and accountability.Meanwhile, Priyanka Gulati, partner, Grant Thornton Bharat, points out, “India doesn’t have a surplus of CEO-ready leaders.” According to Grant Thornton research, less than 10% of senior executives in large Indian companies are “CEO succession ready”.Harsh Goenka, chairman, RPG Enterprises, feels the coCEO model works best in cultures where power sharing and consensus are deeply institutionalised. “India’s corporate DNA, however, remains personality-driven. We look for a single decisive leader, not dual centres of authority. Shared leadership often blurs accountability, slows decisions, and confuses teams... Two leaders at the top can mean divided direction, and divided direction rarely leads to decisive success,” he added.","Global firms, including Comcast, Oracle and Spotify, have announced transitions to co-CEO structures.

NEW DELHI: Adani Enterprises is likely to emerge as the highest bidder to acquire Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) through insolvency process as its offers to pay acquisition amount in two years have been found better than Vedanta’s bid to make payments in five years, sources said.In early September, mining conglomerate Vedanta Group had beaten Adani Group to emerge as the highest bidder, with an offer of Rs 12,505 crore as net present value (NPV), in an auction carried out by lenders to find suitors for JAL, whose interests span real estate, cement, power, hotels, and road.Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd, Jindal Power Ltd, and PNC Infratech Ltd did not bid in the auction process.Later, the lenders held negotiations with these five players to enhance the bid value and maximise realisation.On Oct 14, these five bidders submitted fresh signed resolution plans in sealed envelopes. According to sources, the committee of creditors (CoC) of JAL met last week to deliberate on these comprehensive resolution plans and evaluate them for feasibility and viability.The CoC evaluated the resolution plans on the basis of evaluation matrix and then scored the resolution plan of Adani Enterprise Ltd as the highest, followed by Dalmia Cement (Bharat) and then Vedanta Ltd, they added.Now, the resolution plan could be put to vote by the CoC in the next two weeks, sources said. It is understood that the payments in Dalmia’s plans are contingent upon the Supreme Court’s judgement on the pending matter between the JAL and development authority YEIDA.",Adani Enterprises is likely to emerge as the highest bidder to acquire Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) through insolvency process.

After reviewing the bank, how is IndusInd different from other new-generation banks?

How will you scale up retail business given the distribution requirements?

What is your approach to the mortgage segment, given the competition?





MUMBAI: Two months after taking charge amid a management reshuffle following a derivative loss that took a toll on valuations, IndusInd Bank MD & CEO Rajiv Anand has outlined plans to restore system-level growth by FY27, targeting a 1% RoA within 12–18 months, led by commercial vehicle financing and new ventures in wealth management, acquisition financing, and loans against shares.We have a new CFO, a new internal audit head, a new General Counsel, and a new CRO joining by end-Jan. We are strengthening assurance functions. We are reviewing process architecture to eliminate manual intervention or ensure appropriate controls. The most important change is tone from the top—we want world-class governance, not just industrystandard governance. We are rebuilding teams with highintegrity professionals from within and outside financial services. They will help redefine culture and drive change downwards.Various control gaps were identified. A project team was set up to fix them. Most controls are now in place; a few are work-in-progress. The fixes are being externally validated. We are also auditing other parts of the bank to observe and check if any gaps exist.We are very comfortable on capital. Even after the reorganisation and transformation work, we don’t have to worry about capital.Our overall CRAR is around 17% and CET1 is well over 15% and we should be good for at least two years. I define Year 1 as FY26-27, which is when we start to grow and catch up with the market. By the second half of FY26-27, we’ll get visibility on whether we can accelerate growth. So I would say we are 18–24 months away from needing capital. There is no need for confidence capital. Investors can clearly see we don’t need capital. And considering that stock is trading below book value. Raising money now would be inappropriate. I’d rather raise capital when growth momentum returns.Three large businesses set us apart. First, we are the financier of choice for commercial vehicles, construction equipment and to some extent passenger vehicles. Our market share in these segments is around 6–7%, which is very strong relative to our overall share. The book recently crossed Rs 1 lakh crore. It is diversified, wellrun, profitable, and clean. Second, in the gems & jewellery business we have long-standing relationships with the top 10-15 players in the industry.Yes, the business has been impacted by tariff issues and the US slowdown, but we understand this space well. Third, is microfinance where we have always had a large book. A new CEO has joined Bharat Financial this month. We are strengthening ops and risk controls and will use credit guarantee schemes to buffer volatility. We see 7–8% of our assets remaining in microfinance.We already have about 3,000 branches. The distribution exists, but many branches don’t currently do retail assets. We will enable them through technology. Underwriting will remain centralised with scorecards. We also need to improve collection efficiency, which is work in progress. We are doing a full review of branches.We will add branches where white spaces exist, and relocate under-performing ones where regulations allow. The total branch count will not go down.Our mortgage book is very small, so we can pick and choose. We don’t need to chase the super-prime segment. There is ample opportunity in affordable housing, and cross-selling to commercial vehicle customers.","Rajiv Anand has outlined plans to restore system-level growth by FY27.

Sebi warns on digi-gold investments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-warns-on-digi-gold-investments/articleshow/125212212.cms,"



MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi has warned the general public about investing in digital gold/e-gold products through online platforms since these products are not govt-permitted ‘securities’ and hence not under the regulatory purview of Sebi.The regulator’s warning came at a time when gold prices globally are near their alltime high levels. Recently, there was a phase of frenzied buying of the yellow metal in the country.The regulator also said that in case of any investor complaints, none of the investor protection mechanisms that exist under Sebi’s watch today, would be available to those investing in e-gold/digital gold products.In contrast, Sebi said that it has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various regulated gold products. “These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) offered by mutual funds and electronic gold receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these Sebi-regulated gold products can be made through Sebi registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by Sebi,” a release said.The regulator has taken note of the e-gold and digital gold products being sold by various entities as an alternative to physical gold.“In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from Sebi-regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of Sebi.”“Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.”The regulator also said that investors in such instruments should note that “none of the investor protection mechanisms under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such digital gold/e-gold products.”Digital gold products are sold by some of the biggest names in the jewellery business in India. A PSU in a joint venture with a Swiss company, some online jewellers and e-commerce platforms also sell these products.To buy digital gold, a buyer has to log-in to the website of the seller and can spend as low as Rs 100 to buy the product. The seller gives a receipt of the purchase of the amount invested and the grammage of the gold purchased. When needed, the buyer can surrender the receipt to either get money equivalent to the value of the gold that’s in his possession or exchange a gold jewellery, depending upon the options the seller offers.",Sebi has warned the general public about investing in digital gold/e-gold products. These products are not govt-permitted ‘securities’ and hence not under the regulatory purview of Sebi. The regulator’s warning came at a time when gold prices globally are near their alltime high levels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125212211,imgsize-603738,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-20.jpg"

Government looks to ease burden of quality control orders for cos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-looks-to-ease-burden-of-quality-control-orders-for-cos/articleshow/125212031.cms,".





NEW DELHI: The Centre is set to check proliferation of quality control orders (QCOs) and ease implementation pangs amid widespread criticism by industry, especially from those dependent on imported inputs. Besides, there are multiple complaints of a bunch of ""consultants"" operating to facilitate clearances.Currently, there are 191 QCOs, covering 773 products, ranging from furniture and footwear to door hinges, steel, textiles, petrochemical products & engineering goods with several more in pipeline.Government officials said that there is recognition of some of the concerns at senior levels and there is a need for the norms to be applied on a fewer number of products to ensure that supply chains remain uninterrupted. ""The intention is good, but it has been taken too far and the implementation framework will have to be looked into,"" said an official, adding that the Centre is working to address the concerns. Already, there are checks on the addition of new items. A panel led by Niti Aayog member Rajeev Gauba has recommended scrapping of several QCOs.The idea was to impose minimum quality amid surging imports of sub-standard goods, particularly from China, while aligning domestically-produced products with global standards.There is, however, a backlash from industry who have complained at multiple levels - from ministries concerned to the commerce and industry ministry, the department of consumer affairs, Niti Aayog and the Prime Minister's Office - citing it as an irritant in doing business.One major feedback is that inputs should not be subjected to QCOs and the final product should face the standard. Indian producers, who often rely on Chinese inputs, are particularly peeved as their supplies have been affected.Indian industry itself has a chequered history, first complaining of sub-standard imports, and then opposing any moves to restrict their shipments, officials said, adding that a balance needs to be struck. They added that govt has been extending the implementation deadline while providing carve-outs such as those for MSMEs from compliance to ensure that the QCOs are rolled out without disruption.Besides, some of the administrative ministries have argued that QCOs have resulted in cheap imports being substituted by local production.At the same time, industry players cite the instance of top luxury brands staring at empty footwear shelves due to absence of imports as their facilities were not cleared. Besides, some of the top global players have complained that standards have been devised in a way that even products that are sold in Europe and the US are not compliant with Indian norms.","Currently, there are 191 QCOs, covering 773 products, ranging from furniture and footwear to door hinges.

"US supply chain strain: FAA flight cuts, cargo jet grounding hit US logistics; FedEx and UPS brace for holiday rush",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-supply-chain-strain-faa-flight-cuts-cargo-jet-grounding-hit-us-logistics-fedex-and-ups-brace-for-holiday-rush/articleshow/125205953.cms,"



The US air cargo industry is bracing for fresh turbulence as the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) 10% reduction in flight capacity across 40 major airports collides with the grounding of UPS and FedEx’s McDonnell Douglas MD-11 fleets, deepening pressure on supply chains ahead of the crucial Thanksgiving and holiday shipping season.The FAA ordered airlines to cut domestic flight operations by 10% between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, citing air traffic controller shortages caused by the prolonged government shutdown, AP reported. The decision affects key hubs with major parcel distribution centres — including FedEx’s Memphis and Indianapolis bases and UPS’ Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky, where a deadly cargo plane crash this week killed 14 people, including three crew members.Both companies announced they were grounding their MD-11 aircraft “out of an abundance of caution”, removing a significant chunk of capacity — roughly 9% of UPS’ fleet and 4% of FedEx’s. The double blow has prompted concerns about rising strain on logistics networks just weeks before the peak shopping period.“This is such a stressful time for both companies,” said Patrick Penfield, supply-chain management professor at Syracuse University, quoted AP.“You’ve got a surge in demand, and then you just lost some of your capacity. They’re already scrambling, and now they’re going to scramble even more.” Penfield warned that shoppers could face delivery delays of up to two days in mid-December, urging consumers to order early.While most air freight is international — and thus largely unaffected by the FAA directive — the cutback in domestic passenger flights, which carry about 35% of global trade by value, is expected to cause short-term constraints.FedEx said it had made “operational modifications” to keep shipments moving “safely and swiftly,” while UPS assured customers that its network remains “safe, resilient and reliable.” Both carriers said most of their flights operate outside the restricted hours, reducing immediate impact on overnight deliveries.Still, industry leaders warned of ripple effects. Mike Short, president of global freight forwarder C.H. Robinson, said the reduction in commercial flights could tighten domestic air capacity and extend transit times. “Trucks and expedited ground networks can absorb some displaced volume, but not without challenges,” he said.Smaller high-value goods such as smartphones, chips and consoles rely heavily on air transport, and experts say those shipments may face mild disruption. However, ground transport networks are expected to offset part of the capacity loss for domestic parcels.“Air cargo depends on every part of the aviation ecosystem working in sync,” said Brandon Fried, executive director of the Airforwarders Association. “When capacity is cut and federal employees are stretched thin, the supply chain slows — and the longer this shutdown continues, the worse it will get.”Despite the turbulence, logistics experts say the sector has become more resilient and adaptive after years of pandemic-related shocks. “Airlines have become very good at consolidating loads and rerouting via secondary hubs,” said Eytan Buchman, chief marketing officer of Freightos. “In the near term, space may feel tighter, but this isn’t a one-to-one loss in capacity.”For now, industry watchers expect limited delays — but warn that if the shutdown drags into December, America’s holiday deliveries could face their biggest stress test in years.","FAA ordered airlines to cut domestic flight operations by 10% between 6 a.m and 10 p.m. local time, citing air traffic controller shortages caused by the prolonged government shutdown.

Chip relief: China allows exports of Nexperia chips for civilian use; move to ease global auto supply strain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chip-relief-china-allows-exports-of-nexperia-chips-for-civilian-use-move-to-ease-global-auto-supply-strain/articleshow/125205200.cms,"Big Shock To Trump: Russia, China Declare 'Economic Independence' From U.S. Dollar





China has granted exemptions to export controls on Nexperia chips for civilian applications, its commerce ministry said on Sunday, signalling a potential easing of pressure on the global auto industry hit by supply shortages following earlier curbs, Reuters reported.The announcement marks Beijing’s strongest indication yet that it will relax restrictions imposed after the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, a key supplier of basic chips used in automotive electrical systems.Nexperia, based in the Netherlands but owned by China’s Wingtech Technology, had been at the centre of a trade standoff that disrupted global chip supplies. The Chinese ministry did not define what constitutes “civilian use,” but the move comes after German and Japanese companies said deliveries of Nexperia’s China-made chips had resumed.Despite the exemptions, China–Netherlands relations, and by extension ties with the European Union, are expected to remain strained until the dispute over Nexperia’s ownership and operations is resolved.The Dutch government seized control of the company on September 30, citing concerns that Wingtech’s plans to shift production to China posed a threat to European economic security.In response, China halted exports of Nexperia’s finished chips, which are primarily packaged in China, but last week said it would start accepting applications for export exemptions following a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30.China’s commerce ministry reiterated that it aims to protect global chip supply chains, while accusing the Netherlands of failing to act to resolve the standoff.In its statement Sunday, the ministry urged the European Union to “intensify efforts” to persuade the Netherlands to reverse its decision.“China welcomes the EU to continue leveraging its influence to urge the Netherlands to promptly rectify its erroneous actions,” the ministry said.","China grants exemptions to export controls on Nexperia chips for civilian applications.

US economy strain: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says impact of shutdown getting ‘worse and worse’; warns of deepening fallout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-strain-treasury-secretary-scott-bessent-says-impact-of-shutdown-getting-worse-and-worse-warns-of-deepening-fallout/articleshow/125202747.cms,"U.S Senate Emergency: Chuck Schumer Makes Big Shutdown Offer To Republicans; 'Waiting For Yes'





US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the economic fallout from the prolonged government shutdown is intensifying, saying the situation is getting “worse and worse” as disruptions ripple through key sectors and strain public finances.Air traffic across the United States could “slow to a trickle” if the federal government shutdown continues into the busy Thanksgiving travel season, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Sunday, as flight cancellations and staff shortages deepen the crisis in the aviation sector, AP reported.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week ordered flight cuts at major airports after growing absenteeism among air traffic controllers, who have gone unpaid for nearly a month. The reductions, which began Friday at 4%, are set to rise to 10% by November 14, affecting all commercial airlines between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time.As of Sunday morning, 1,375 flights had been cancelled across the country, following more than 1,500 cancellations on Saturday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.Duffy said further cuts of up to 20% might be necessary if the shutdown persists and controllers miss another pay cycle.“More controllers aren’t coming to work day by day, the further they go without a paycheck,” he told Fox News Sunday.Looking ahead to the holiday season, Duffy warned of severe disruptions: “As we get closer to Thanksgiving travel, you’re going to have air travel slow to a trickle as everyone wants to travel to see their families,” he said, adding that with “very few controllers working,” only limited flights would take off and land.“You’re going to have massive disruption and a lot of angry Americans,” he said. “We have to be honest about where this is going — it doesn’t get better. It gets worse until these air traffic controllers are paid.”The US has faced an air traffic controller shortage for years, and the situation has worsened under the shutdown, with 15 to 20 controllers retiring daily, Duffy told CNN.He said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had offered to deploy military air traffic controllers, though it remains unclear whether they are qualified to operate civilian systems.Duffy rejected Democratic claims that the cancellations were politically motivated, insisting the cuts were necessary to maintain safety. “I needed to take action to keep people safe,” he said. “I’m doing what I can in a mess that Democrats have put in my lap.”","FAA last week ordered flight cuts at major airports after growing absenteeism among air traffic controllers, who have gone unpaid for nearly a month.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden





Pakistan’s manufacturing industry, once considered a key driver of economic growth and employment, is undergoing one of its worst downturns in recent history.The sector has seen a steep 46 per cent fall in private investment over the past six years, raising fears of long-term stagnation among economists and industrial experts.According to The Express Tribune report cited by news agency ANI, private investment in manufacturing dropped from PKR 706 billion in FY2018–19 to just PKR 377 billion in FY2024–25, marking the weakest phase of industrial growth in more than a decade.Ali Imran Asif, Senior Executive Committee Member of the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), warned that the current level of investment was “not enough to even replace depreciating machinery,” suggesting a deep erosion of Pakistan’s industrial foundation.“We are not dealing with a short-term dip; we are watching our industrial base disintegrate,” Asif said, as per The Express Tribune.He stressed that without structural reforms focused on productivity, innovation, and competitiveness, the country could face prolonged industrial paralysis.The combined contribution of the manufacturing and mining sectors to Pakistan’s GDP has remained stagnant at around 13.2 per cent over the past six years.Frequent policy changes, high energy costs, and volatile currency movements have severely affected export-oriented sectors such as textiles, leather, and engineering goods.Large-scale manufacturing output fell 1.5 per cent in FY25, reversing the 0.92 per cent growth recorded in FY24.In contrast, neighbouring economies like India and Bangladesh have maintained strong industrial growth supported by stable policies and export diversification.Economist Shahid Saleem noted that Pakistan’s slump is not merely the result of high interest rates but also reflects policy inconsistency and eroding investor confidence.Import restrictions and weak domestic demand have forced many factories to run below capacity, he added.Experts, as cited by ANI, warned that unless Pakistan swiftly formulates a credible industrial revival plan and ensures policy stability, the manufacturing sector’s decline will deepen further, undermining exports, employment and broader economic resilience.","Pakistan’s manufacturing industry is undergoing one of its worst downturns in recent history.

Flying private jets is no longer just for the ultra-rich,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/flying-private-jets-is-no-longer-just-for-the-ultra-rich/articleshow/125198189.cms,"An AI-generated image

Private jet deliveries are up

Who is the typical private jet buyer?

Who is the typical private jet user?



What is a private jet exactly?

The sky-high cost(s) of owning a jet

Time is the new ultimate luxury







It is not just superstars, royal families or oligarchs skipping long security lines and sitting in the cushy leather seats anymore.Today, there are more options than ever to take to the skies in a private jet without being head of state, CEO or owning a plane outright.Since the Covid-19 pandemic travel slump, planemakers have made a steady recovery driven by strong customer demand.Currently, there are around 23,500 private jets in service globally, according to Denesz Thiyagarajan, head of the general aviation team at IBA Insight, an aviation advisory company.In 2020, there were 644 business-jet deliveries. By 2024, this jumped to 764. For this year, Thiyagarajan and his team forecast another 820 deliveries, which is a 7.3% year-on-year increase. There are waiting lists for some of the most in-demand jets.JetNet, another aviation analyst, expects nearly 9,700 new business jets to be delivered globally through 2034.Private jet buyers are typically high-net-worth individuals, governments, corporations or charter operators like NetJets or FlexJets. The market remains dominated by wholly owned aircraft, Thiyagarajan told DW, though so-called fractional ownership is increasing.Daniel Riefer, a Munich-based partner at McKinsey's travel, logistics and infrastructure practice, says from a business model perspective, fractional ownership operators have seen ""the strongest expansion over the past five years.""Besides fractional ownership, subscriptions or membership programs, which provide cardholders access to an operator's entire fleet for a certain number of flight hours, are also becoming more popular. These branded charter operators usually own and operate their fleets directly.Aircraft owned by individuals or companies are often managed by service providers, who may additionally charter them to others when not in use, Riefer, who is also a former commercial airline pilot, told DW.The profile of the average private jet user has changed and expanded since the pandemic. Today, it is no longer just the ultra-rich and corporate executives who step onboard.The market now includes ""families, entrepreneurs and first-time flyers seeking safety, flexibility, reliability and luxury that commercial airlines couldn't guarantee during the crisis,"" said Thiyagarajan.The aviation expert thinks this shift was caused by a big wealth transfer, high liquidity and changing priorities after the pandemic. At the same time, the increase in charter and membership options makes access to private jets easier.Not only are more jets being sold, they are flying more, too. Hours flown on private jets are around 115% to 120% above 2019 levels, according to Riefer, though usage varies by region and is influenced by things like the availability of commercial airlines and transport infrastructure.Private jets, also referred to as business or corporate jets, come in seven different categories based on size and range, explains Thiyagarajan.The smallest business jet is a 4-seat, single-pilot plane with a short range. After that comes mid-range jets for 6-10 passengers. Then there are longer-range jets for 10-19 passengers and finally executive airliners with room for 20 to 50 or more passengers.At the top rung of the executive airliner ladder are jets for premium long-haul travel. Boeing Business Jets recently announced a new full-service program to turn commercial Boeing 747-8s into such executive airliners.The commercial version of these Boeings holds about 600 passengers. The updated 747-8 VIP will be the largest private jet in the air and have space for around 75 passengers, according to the company.Not everyone is looking for the biggest and best. But there is more demand for larger jets ""particularly in the super-midsize and long-range categories,"" said Riefer, ""while midsize and light jets have declined as a share of the total fleet over the past decade.""For Boeing and Airbus turning their commercial jets into tailored private aircraft is a side business. Other companies focus on it like US-based Gulfstream, Honda Aircraft and Textron, Canada's Bombardier, Brazil's Embraer, France's Dassault, and Pilatus in Switzerland.List price for a brand-new private jet can cost anywhere from a few million dollars to over $75 million (€64.9 million) for a Gulfstream G700 or $78 million for a Bombardier Global 8000, and that is before any customization.The Boeing 747-8 VIP is expected to cost a few hundred million dollars. And those are just the costs of buying a jet.Actually flying it costs even more. Fixed and operating expenses like fuel, maintenance, insurance, landing, parking, crew and catering can add up to another few million a year depending on size and use.Private jets produce more emissions per passenger than commercial planes, and climate activists have targeted them because they represent elite excess and unnecessary emissions. But for most frequent flyers, it will take more than protesters to keep them off the tarmac.For manufacturers, geopolitical uncertainty and tariffs are having some impact on supply chains and their ability to churn out aircraft, which is leading to backlogs. Yet, a broader economic downturn seems far off.Denesz Thiyagarajan expects to see sustained growth in the next few years driven by rising global wealth, more corporate use and increased accessibility through charter programs and fractional ownership.Daniel Riefer agrees but points out regional differences. ""The US will remain the largest market in absolute terms, while the fastest growth is projected in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America,"" he said.""The fractional ownership model is likely to gain further share, enhancing utilization and making private aviation more accessible and flexible.""","There are around 23,500 private jets in service globally, according to IBA Insight.

Will the AI bubble burst as investors grow wary of returns?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-the-ai-bubble-burst-as-investors-grow-wary-of-returns/articleshow/125198174.cms,"Photo credit: ANI

France Backs India’s AI Vision: Anne Bouverot Lauds New Delhi’s Balance Between Innovation, Ethics

Corporations are hesitant over AI adoption

Unsustainable capital burn

Investors increasingly cautious

When will the bubble pop?





The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent.Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030.Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations.But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits.Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting.""The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer,"" Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW.""Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst.""The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August.AI’s biggest challenge remains its tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but false information. Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time.""Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances,"" said Frey.As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade.In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month.""What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI,"" economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW.Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September.Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are ""charging far less than they need to make a profit"" and should raise subscription prices.Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI despite little evidence of sustainable returns dwarfs previous speculative frenzies.""We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP, four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust,"" Garran told DW.Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability.That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses.""The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production,"" he told DW.Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion.""With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped,"" Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. ""My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense.""Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up.""They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall,"" Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is ""skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better.""Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a ""market correction"" in AI, rather than a ""cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'""After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus ""shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact.""""More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns,"" she added.","Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value. But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125198342,imgsize-694174,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2025-11-09t124633252.jpg"
"US–China trade ties: Beijing halts export ban on ‘dual-use’ materials; gallium, germanium, antimony set to flow again",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uschina-trade-ties-beijing-halts-export-ban-on-dual-use-materials-gallium-germanium-antimony-set-to-flow-again/articleshow/125198144.cms,"China Rushes Missile Expansion, Replacing Farms As Xi Asserts Military Dominance Over U.S.





China has stepped back from one of its toughest trade measures against the United States, pausing a ban that restricted exports of gallium, germanium, antimony and other products linked to high-tech manufacturing. The commerce ministry said on Sunday that the suspension applies to “dual-use” items, goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes and takes effect immediately.The export controls were originally introduced in December 2024. The pause will remain in place until November 27, 2026, according to the ministry’s statement cited by Reuters.The announcement follows a recent meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on 30 October in South Korea. During the talks, the two leaders agreed to soften parts of their tariff dispute and unwind several penalties imposed on each other over the past year of escalating trade measures.Throughout the tariff stand-off, both countries repeatedly raised import duties, at one point reaching triple-digit levels. The dispute disrupted global supply chains and slowed movement of goods between the world’s two largest economies.China has held a significant influence over the supply of these metals, which are essential for modern technology used in semiconductors, smartphones and advanced military systems. By restricting shipments, Beijing had sought to exploit its dominant position in the critical minerals market.Alongside the freeze on the gallium, germanium and antimony curbs, the ministry confirmed that it has also suspended tighter checks on end-users and end-use purposes for dual-use graphite exports to the United States. These checks were introduced at the same time as the metal restrictions.The move forms part of a broader rollback. On Friday, China announced it would also pause export controls imposed on October 9, which included widened restrictions on certain rare earth elements and lithium battery materials.Xi and Trump earlier agreed that, for the next year, both sides would scale back tariffs and hold off on further trade actions, a step aimed at preventing fresh escalation while negotiations continue.","China has stepped back from one of its toughest trade measures against the United States.

China CPI: Inflation rises 0.2% after months of stagnation in October; property and spending pressures persist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-cpi-inflation-rises-0-2-after-months-of-stagnation-in-october-property-and-spending-pressures-persist/articleshow/125197208.cms,"



China saw a mild increase in consumer prices in October, breaking a stretch of stagnation and decline as the world’s second-largest economy continues to fight a series of economic setbacks.Official figures released on Sunday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that the consumer price index (CPI) edged up 0.2% year-on-year last month. Before this, prices were unchanged in July and then slipped into negative territory for the next two months.The improvement comes at a time when Beijing is still trying to stabilise its post-pandemic recovery. The government is juggling several issues at once, a worsening debt crisis in the country’s massive property sector, weak consumer spending and high youth unemployment.Tensions with the United States had added to the strain. The trade conflict between the two countries intensified earlier this year. However, the situation eased at the end of October when US President Donald Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, leading to a temporary detente between the two economic giants.While consumer prices nudged higher, factory-gate prices continued to fall in October.The NBS said the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures prices of goods before they reach wholesale or distribution, dropped 2.1% from a year earlier, slightly better than the 2.3% decline recorded in September.A drop in PPI typically tightens margins for manufacturers, particularly during aggressive price competition. Authorities have been working to curb such price wars.Even with October’s slight rise in consumer prices, China’s broader economic recovery remains under pressure, with policymakers still searching for ways to shore up growth.","Consumer price index (CPI) edged up 0.2% year-on-year last month.

"US shutdown: More than 2,500 flights cancelled over weekend; passengers left confused amid Thanksgiving season",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-shutdown-more-than-2500-flights-cancelled-over-weekend-passengers-left-confused-amid-thanksgiving-season/articleshow/125196733.cms,"2000 U.S. Flights Hit Or Grounded As Shutdown Chaos Cripples U.S. Aviation | Crises At Airports

Surge in cancellations





Passengers face costs, confusion and tough decisions





Broader economic risks emerge









Flight schedules across the United States were thrown off course this weekend, after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered airlines to scale back operations due to the ongoing government shutdown, a move that has already led to more than 2,500 cancellations by Saturday evening.The FAA’s directive, issued because staffing levels have dropped at radar centres and control towers, is being applied to all commercial carriers. What began as a 4% reduction at 40 key airports is set to tighten again on Tuesday and reach 10% by Friday. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy has warned that further cuts may follow if conditions deteriorate.At airports from Atlanta to Newark, passengers spent Saturday navigating changing departure boards and queues. Miami-bound traveller Emmy Holguin, 36, was hoping to make it to the Dominican Republic to see her family.“We all travel. We all have somewhere to be,” she told AP.“I'm hoping that the government can take care of this.”Flight tracking service FlightAware recorded just over 1,000 cancellations on Friday. By Saturday, usually one of the quietest flying days, the figure had climbed to more than 1,500, with airlines scrapping another thousand-plus flights planned for Sunday.The airport disruptions are not universal, but the tensions are building. Staffing shortages, which existed before the shutdown, have worsened as air traffic controllers have now gone nearly a month without pay. Many are working six-day overtime weeks for no salary, while others are calling in sick or seeking temporary employment to pay their bills, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The union delivered 1,600 handwritten letters to Congress on Saturday, urging lawmakers to end the shutdown.Most travellers are still managing to get rebooked, and international long-haul flights remain mostly unaffected. However, with no clarity on which flights might be dropped next, anxiety is spreading.“Travel is stressful enough. Then you put these disruptions in place, and it really makes everything more challenging,” said Heather Xu, 46, who was in Miami after a cruise and trying to return to Puerto Rico.Some travellers are choosing not to take the risk at all. Diana Alvear, from Bridgewater, New Jersey, cancelled her family’s upcoming trip to California over fears of getting stranded and concerns about safety when controllers are overworked.United Airlines issued flight credit, but she and her family lost almost $700 on a prepaid Airbnb booking.“This has been costly to us, and it’s a huge disappointment for us and our family,” she said. “It’s really weighing on our hearts that we had to do this.”Rental car companies reported a surge in one-way bookings on Friday as travellers opted to take to the road instead of waiting for new flights.The concerns now stretch far beyond airlines and passengers. Almost half of America’s air freight moves inside passenger aircraft, which means reductions in flight volumes can quickly affect retailers and supply chains.Shipping costs could rise and eventually be passed along to consumers, said Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University.Losses could ripple into hotels, tourism-dependent cities and businesses that rely on corporate travel, according to Greg Raiff, CEO of Elevate Aviation Group.“This shutdown is going to impact everything from cargo aircraft to people getting to business meetings to tourists being able to travel,” Raiff said. “It’s going to hit the hotel taxes and city taxes. There’s a cascading effect that results from this thing.”With the shutdown showing no signs of ending and Thanksgiving travel season approaching: airlines, industry analysts and millions of passengers now face a growing question: how much worse will the disruption get?","More than 2,500 U.S. flights have been cancelled due to the government shutdown.

"Thanksgiving on budget: US retailers push cheaper private-label meals; here's what Walmart, Target & more are doing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thanksgiving-on-budget-us-retailers-push-cheaper-private-label-meals-heres-what-walmart-target-more-are-doing/articleshow/125196537.cms,"



This Thanksgiving, retailers in the United States are leaning heavily on private-label products to promote what they say are the most affordable meal deals in years.Walmart, Target and Aldi are each highlighting cost savings ahead of the holiday, but the reductions come with trimmed menus and more store-brand substitutes.At Walmart, this year's meal bundle includes nine Great Value private-label items out of a total of 15. A year ago, nine of the 21 items were from the retailer’s own brand, according to Reuters.The shift comes after the company removed ingredients such as onions, celery and broth, and introduced its own stuffing mix. The turkey has also changed. Instead of last year’s Honeysuckle White, priced then at 88 cents per pound, the meal now features the more recognisable Butterball turkey at 96 cents per pound.Walmart’s current bundle costs less than $40 and is designed to feed 10 people. Last year’s meal was priced at around $56 and fed eight. The number of items has also dropped, from 29 to 22, although the bundle includes multiples of staples like corn and green beans. Walmart declined to comment on the changes.The lower prices entered the political conversation this week.President Donald Trump, who has faced declining approval ratings on his handling of the economy, has repeatedly mentioned Walmart’s reduced pricing and claimed that holiday costs are down 25% from last year.When a reporter noted that the current basket includes fewer food items, Trump responded that he was not aware of that difference and called the suggestion ""fake news.""Even outside holiday promotions, consumer behaviour mirrors what retailers are doing. A NielsenIQ survey from September found that 58% of shoppers are extremely worried about rising food prices, while 31% said they would opt for private-label brands whenever possible. Government figures show food costs in September were 2.7% higher than a year earlier. At the same time, U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen to its lowest point in three and a half years, and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history has caused delays in SNAP food aid payments, adding pressure for low-income households.""One of our most-asked questions in the store right now is 'How do I save money on my food'?"" said Stew Leonard Jr, CEO of the Connecticut-based Stew Leonard’s chain. ""One of the things we recommend is definitely exploring private label.""Aldi has taken a similar approach. The discount supermarket, known for its private-label dominance, is offering a Thanksgiving spread for $40 to feed 10 people, down from $47 a year ago. The retailer swapped out last year’s Butterball turkey in favour of the cheaper Jennie-O variety, cutting around 30 cents per pound. Butterball is still available for shoppers who prefer it, priced at 97 cents per pound. Aldi has also replaced a single pie crust with a frozen two-pack and reduced pricing on carrots, potatoes and onions.Target’s seven-item meal kit also contains modifications, as per a Reuters report. This year, the retailer introduced its own-brand bread and frozen corn, eliminating nationally known products such as Del Monte green beans and Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom Soup. The kit remains priced at under $20 and is intended to serve four people, the same as last year. A Target spokesperson said that the selection varies slightly each year, based on shopper interest and product availability, adding that most customers do not buy their Thanksgiving items until the week before the holiday.","Walmart, Target and Aldi are each highlighting cost savings ahead of the holiday.

US Shutdown: Trump demands ACA payments go straight to Americans; hits at 'fat cat' insurers and Obamacare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-shutdown-trump-demands-aca-payments-go-straight-to-americans-hits-at-fat-cat-insurers-and-obamacare/articleshow/125196246.cms,"2000 U.S. Flights Hit Or Grounded As Shutdown Chaos Cripples U.S. Aviation | Crises At Airports





US President Donald Trump has escalated his attack on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), urging Republicans to divert federal healthcare payments directly to Americans instead of insurance companies, as the ongoing government shutdown marks its longest stretch in US history.In a new post on Sunday, Trump repeated his demand that Republicans stop sending what he described as vast sums of money to insurers participating in the ACA marketplace.“NO MORE MONEY, HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, TO THE DEMOCRAT SUPPORTED INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR REALLY BAD OBAMACARE. THE MONEY MUST NOW GO DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE, TAKING THE ‘FAT CAT’ INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THE CORRUPT SYSTEM OF HEALTHCARE,"" he said on Truth Social.The US President further asserted that the people can buy much better policy on their own, “FOR MUCH LESS MONEY, SAVING, FOR THEMSELVES, AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE!!!”Trump’s remarks follow a similar proposal he posted earlier, in which he pressed Republicans to send ACA-related federal subsidies straight to Americans. He framed the idea as part of a compromise to break the political deadlock over government funding.“I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,” he wrote on Truth Social.The shutdown began on October 1 and continues without a resolution, after Senate Republicans rejected a proposal from Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. According to CNBC, Democrats offered to reopen the government by allowing ACA subsidies to remain in place for one year, while dropping their demand to extend Obamacare tax credits for a longer period.Those subsidies support more than 20 million people, and without action by Congress, they will expire at the end of December. Democrats say that figure could reach 24 million when counting Americans who are expected to renew coverage.Republicans have dismissed the Democratic plan, insisting that the government must be reopened before negotiations resume on other policy matters. Senate Majority Leader John Thune labelled the Democrats’ offer a “non-starter.”Beyond the funding fight, Trump is also intensifying pressure on Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster, the rule requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation. The GOP currently holds 53 seats in the 100-member chamber, with 45 Democrats and two independents aligned with them, CNBC reported.With neither side offering new concessions, the shutdown continues with millions of Americans caught in the middle.","US President Donald Trump has escalated his attack on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) He is urging Republicans to divert federal healthcare payments directly to Americans instead of insurance companies.

Local businesses see sales fall, jobs vanish

Families under pressure as aid stalls





Washington’s economy is facing deepening distress as the longest-ever US government shutdown, mass layoffs of federal workers, and cuts to food assistance converge to hit households and small businesses across the capital region, AP reported.The Capital Area Food Bank, which supports more than 400 pantries and aid organisations across the District of Columbia, northern Virginia, and two Maryland counties, is preparing to provide 8 million more meals than planned this year — a nearly 20% increase.“This city has been hit especially hard because of the sequence of events that has occurred over the course of this year,” said Radha Muthiah, CEO and president of the food bank.The nation’s capital, home to roughly 150,000 federal employees, has been reeling from layoffs, the shutdown, and heightened law enforcement deployment. With the shutdown halting pay for hundreds of thousands of workers and freezing federal food aid, the economic strain has intensified.The District’s unemployment rate stood at 6% in September, one of the highest in the nation, compared with the US average of 4.3%.Economists warn that the regional impact of the shutdown will persist well after federal operations resume.Political reverberations are also being felt: Democrat Abigail Spanberger’s win in Virginia’s governor’s race was fuelled in part by her focus on the economic fallout of President Donald Trump ’s policies on the region.Washington’s restaurants, bars, and small retailers — heavily reliant on federal employees’ spending — have reported steep drops in sales. The Restaurant Association of Greater Washington said many eateries already operating on thin margins are now struggling to stay afloat as federal staff skip commutes and dining out.“Going without paychecks is causing cash flow issues for federal workers, and that’s spilling over into small businesses,” said Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow at Brookings Metro, quoted AP. “A lot of businesses rely on higher spending in Q4 to stay profitable for the year.”At The Queen Vic, a British pub in northeast Washington, co-owner Ryan Gordon said weekend crowds have halved. “We still had seats for people, which means the bars around us who get our overflow got nothing,” he said, estimating business is down 50% since the shutdown began.The financial strain is also pushing middle-income families into crisis. Thea Price, a former employee of the US Institute of Peace, lost her job in March, followed by her husband’s job loss as a government contractor.After relying on SNAP food assistance and savings, the couple’s payments were halted by the shutdown. With limited options left, Price is leaving Washington for her hometown near Seattle.“We can’t afford to stay in the area any longer and hope something might pan out,” she said. “We’re just in a much different place than when these things started.”At the Capital Area Food Bank, forklifts are running overtime to meet growing demand. “We’re focused on getting food to those who need it,” Muthiah said. “But people are borrowing against their futures to pay for basic necessities today.”","Washington’s restaurants, bars, and small retailers — heavily reliant on federal employees’ spending — have reported steep drops in sales.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Gold and silver price prediction today: Will gold prices hit the Rs 1 lakh mark anytime soon? Experts are of the view that amidst ongoing global economic uncertainty due to Donald Trump’s tariff war, gold as a safe haven asset is in focus. Silver prices too have seen a significant rally.Prices have broken the strong ₹96,500 resistance zone, triggering a short-term bullish bias in MCX gold. Technicals suggest immediate upside targets near ₹98,500 and possibly further higher toward ₹99,800 if momentum picks up.Several technical indicators reinforce this positive near-term outlook: gold has regained above its 9 period EMAs, the RSI above 50 zone, and MACD on the verge of giving positive crossover—classic signs of a short-term uptrend. As long as ₹96,500 remains supported, bulls retain control.In markets over the medium-to-long term, gold fundamentals remain favourable. Easing Fed rate pressure, geopolitical uncertainty, and supportive macro trends are expected to propel prices higher over the longer horizon.The bias is positive in the short run—watch ₹98,500–₹99,800 as next resistance.S ilver prices witnessed a significant rally recently, touching highs near ₹1,15,000 per kg before experiencing some profit booking and cooling off towards the ₹1,12,000 mark. Despite the short-term correction, the overall trend in silver remains firmly positive, underpinned by both technical strength and fundamental support.From a technical standpoint, silver continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of a sustained uptrend. The key support is now placed at ₹1,09,000, and as long as prices hold above this level, the upward bias is likely to remain intact. On the higher side, a breakout above ₹1,15,000 could open the gates for a move towards ₹1,18,000 in the coming sessions.Fundamentally, silver continues to benefit from strong industrial demand, especially in sectors like electronics, electric vehicles, and solar panel manufacturing. Additionally, global macroeconomic uncertainties and expectations of potential rate cuts by major central banks have renewed investor interest in precious metals as a safe haven.Any dips towards support levels can be seen as buying opportunities for traders with a positive outlook. With the confluence of strong fundamentals and supportive technicals, silver prices are well-positioned to resume their upward trajectory in the medium term.","Experts are of the view that amidst ongoing global economic uncertainty due to Donald Trump’s tariff war, gold as a safe haven asset is in focus.

Stock market recommendations:Equity benchmark indices traded sideways within a tight range, mirroring muted investor sentiment amid elevated uncertainty around the India-US trade dialogue and the onset of the Q1 FY26 earnings season. Market action remained largely stock-specific as participants adopted a wait-and-watch approach, seeking greater clarity on macroeconomic developments and corporate earnings visibility.Notably, the index has taken 12 sessions to retrace merely 50% of the preceding 11-session uptrend (from 24,473 to 25,669), reflecting a shallow pullback and signaling a healthy consolidation. This price action underscores a structurally positive setup, with the formation of a higher base around the psychological and technical support zone of 25,000, reinforcing the bullish undertone.Over the past two sessions, the index has posted near-identical intraday highs around the 25,255 marks, coinciding with the 20-day EMA—creating a critical confluence zone. A decisive breakout above this level could act as a trigger for the next leg of the uptrend, with potential upside toward the 25,600 zone in the coming weeks. Conversely, inability to convincingly surpass the 25,255 hurdles may result in continued consolidation within the 25,000–25,250 band.Amid this setup, intermittent volatility cannot be ruled out, given the overlapping headwinds from the Q1 FY26 earnings season and persistent ambiguity around India–US tariff negotiations.From a structural standpoint, the index continues to form higher highs and higher lows—demonstrating resilience in the face of geopolitical noise and policy uncertainty. Additionally, improving market internals add conviction to the bullish narrative, with 67% of Nifty 500 constituents now trading above their 200-day SMA—up significantly from 52% last month—signaling broad-based participation and lending credibility to the sustainability of the ongoing structural uptrend.Nifty has strong support between 24,900-25,100 levels which we expect to hold being the confluence of (a) the rising 50 days EMA (b) rising trendline support joining lows of May and June 2025 (c) 61.8% retracement of the previous up move (24473-25669) (d) the upper band of the recent breakout area placed around 25000 levels.Bank Nifty traded within a narrow consolidation band last week, reflecting subdued investor sentiment amid heightened uncertainty surrounding the India-US trade negotiations and ahead of the Q1 FY26 earnings season of the banking stocks.The index continues to trade above its 20-day EMA level it has consistently respected since April—signaling that the underlying bullish trend remains firmly intact. This, combined with improving market breadth, reinforces the higher high–higher low-price structure, suggesting a well-entrenched uptrend. The setup paves the way for a potential move towards the 58,500 zone in the upcoming weeks.The index on expected lines in the last 10 sessions is seen consolidating in the range 56,500-57,600. We expect the index to extend the same, and only a move beyond this range will signal the next directional move in the index.Key short-term term support is placed at 56,000–55,500 region, representing a confluence of the 50-day EMA and the key retracement level. The broader trend remains positive, and the current consolidation should be viewed as buying opportunities.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, UPL and Varun Beverages are the top stock picks for today.

US President Donald Trump called on Republicans to extend their full support to the GENIUS Act, a sweeping bill aimed at regulating stablecoins and asserting America’s dominance in the digital asset space.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “HAPPY CRYPTO WEEK! The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets - Nobody does it better! The GENIUS Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can’t do it.”“Digital Assets are the FUTURE, and we are leading by a lot! Get the first Vote done this afternoon (ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!). This is our moment - Digital Assets, GENIUS, Clarity! It is all part of Making America Great Again, BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.”The US President said America is leading the world and will continue working with the Senate and House to push through more related legislation.Earlier, Trump wrote that he had met with 11 of the 12 lawmakers needed to pass the GENIUS Act, and after a brief discussion, all had agreed to vote in favour of the Rule the following morning.Describing the bill as a cornerstone of his MAGA agenda, he said, “Speaker of the House Mike Johnson was at the meeting via telephone, and looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible. I want to thank the Congressmen/women for their quick and positive response. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”The GENIUS Act is a proposed law that aims to introduce the first-ever federal framework to regulate stablecoins, cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to assets like the US dollar.The bill is designed to bring clarity and oversight to the rapidly growing digital asset market. Supporters say it balances the need for consumer protection with the push for financial innovation, despite ongoing political debates and concerns around transparency.Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are used widely for digital payments, cross-border transfers, and decentralised finance (DeFi). The market for stablecoins has ballooned to nearly $250 billion, raising concerns about financial stability and the lack of regulation.The legislation sets out rules on how stablecoins are issued, the kind of reserves required to back them, and how transparent issuers need to be. It introduces federal oversight to close legal gaps and prevent misuse by bad actors. Supporters believe the bill brings long-needed clarity and safeguards to an industry that has largely operated without clear laws.",US President Donald Trump called on Republicans to extend their full support to the GENIUS Act.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have been somewhat stable in the last few days, with safe haven assets being in focus even as global economic uncertainty wanes despite US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. A strong dollar has capped gains in gold. What’s the outlook for gold prices and what strategy should investors adopt in the current scenario? Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:Gold prices have shown resilience around key support levels, with the MCX Gold August Futures currently trading around ₹97,480. The underlying tone remains cautiously optimistic, supported by a bounce from critical moving average confluence. With momentum indicators showing signs of stabilization, the intraday bias shifts towards a Buy on Dip strategy near ₹97,350, with downside risk capped around ₹96,800.1. EMA Alignment Signals Support: The 8-period EMA stands at ₹97,450, while the 21-period EMA is at ₹97,350. The price is currently testing the 21-EMA support, creating a favorable entry zone around ₹97,350. This confluence of moving averages provides a strong foundation for potential upward momentum.2. Bollinger Bands Indicate Consolidation: The Bollinger Bands show price action consolidating within the bands, with the lower band providing support near the ₹97,350 zone. This tight range suggests potential volatility expansion, favoring a breakout scenario once the accumulation phase completes.3. Pivot Point Perspective: Previous day's pivot points reveal strong support confluence around the ₹97,350 level. The price structure shows respect for these technical levels, with multiple touches confirming the zone's significance for intraday positioning.4. RSI (14) Reading: The Relative Strength Index is currently in neutral territory, suggesting room for upward movement without immediate overbought concerns. This positioning supports the buy-on-dip thesis as momentum can expand in either direction.5. MACD Momentum: The MACD indicator shows potential bullish divergence forming, with the histogram suggesting underlying strength building. This technical pattern often precedes renewed upward momentum from support zones.6. Price Structure and Volume: Recent price action shows strong buying interest near the ₹97,350 support level, with volume accumulation suggesting institutional participation. The price closing above key congestion zones confirms sustained demand at these levels.Gold intraday bias remains constructive on pullbacks. Traders can adopt a Buy on Dip strategy near the ₹97,350 mark, placing a protective stop-loss at ₹96,800. Upside targets for the session could be ₹97,800 and ₹98,200, provided the global sentiment remains supportive and prices hold above the 21-period EMA confluence.","Gold prices have shown resilience around key support levels.

Wipro revenue drops 2.3% in June quarter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wipro-revenue-drops-2-3-in-june-quarter/articleshow/122706298.cms,"File photo

Q1FY26 Snapshot

BENGALURU: Wipro’s revenue declined by 2.3% in constant currency during the June quarter, though the drop remained within its projected guidance range of –3.5% to –1.5%.“We started the quarter facing significant macro uncertainty, which kept overall demand muted. Our clients prioritised initiatives with immediate impact, focusing on cost optimisation and vendor consolidation. At the same time, they accelerated their AI, data, and modernisation programs. We saw a clear trend of many AI projects moving to scale and production,” said Wipro CEO Srini Pallia.Operating margins fell to 17.3% in the June quarter from 17.5% in the March quarter of last fiscal, though this marked an 80-basis-point improvement year-on-year. “In Q1 we delivered 17.3%, which is a 20-basis-point movement. If you look at forex, it’s really flattish. Our utilisation has been flattish. We’ve had some savings in selling, general and administrative expenses, and we had the revenue decline being offset through operational improvements. That’s broadly how I would characterise the margins for the quarter,” said CFO Aparna Iyer.Despite modest revenue performance, Wipro reported strong deal wins, with total contract value (TCV) reaching $5 billion—a 50.7% year-on-year increase.Large deals contributed $2.7 billion, up 131% year-on-year. Iyer noted that execution of these large deals would span 6–8 quarters, with stronger impact expected in the second half of the fiscal. Most of these deals focused on cost reduction and vendor consolidation.Across geographies, the Americas grew 1.5% year-on-year in constant currency, maintaining strong deal momentum. Revenue in APMEA remained flat, supported by digital spending in India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Pallia said Europe continued to face headwinds, with clients prioritising competitiveness. “In BFSI, demand is strong and steady,” he said.Wipro has guided for sequential revenue growth of -1% to 1% in constant currency for the Sept quarter. Wipro’s workforce declined by 114 employees, bringing total headcount to 233,232 at the end of the June quarter.","Wipro’s revenue declined by 2.3% in constant currency during the June quarter.

MUMBAI: State Bank of India’s Rs 25,000 crore qualified institutional placement (QIP) has been oversubscribed by over three times, with investment bankers expecting bids to touch Rs 1 lakh crore.The Life Insurance Corporation of India and domestic mutual funds such as HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential Life were among the top investors who bid for the shares. Foreign investors included Nomura, Millennium, BlackRock, and British hedge fund Marshall Wace.Bankers said foreign investors view the State Bank of India as a proxy for India. They also noted that this is a rare opportunity to make large investments in a blue-chip stock without disrupting the market.The QIP was officially launched on July 16, 2025, with the floor price set at Rs 811.05 per share—a 2.5% discount to the previous day’s closing price. This marks SBI’s first major equity fundraising via QIP since its Rs 15,000 crore issue in 2017.SBI's common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital stood at 10.81% as of Mar 31, 2025, among the lowest levels for large public sector banks. The new capital is expected to improve the CET1 ratio by up to 60 basis points, strengthening the bank’s financial position and enabling greater credit growth.The capital infusion is aimed at supporting the bank’s expanding loan book and meeting regulatory norms, as SBI’s assets have crossed the Rs 60 trillion mark.The QIP will also result in a marginal reduction in the government’s ownership, which stood at 57.43%, as shares are sold to institutional investors.SBI has appointed several leading investment banks—Citigroup, HSBC, ICICI Securities, Kotak, Morgan Stanley, and SBI Capital—to manage the transaction, with all firms offering their services without charging fees.","State Bank of India’s Rs 25,000 crore qualified institutional placement has been oversubscribed by over three times.

BENGALURU: A lawyer for Glas Trust Company, which represents lenders to Byju’s Alpha Inc., allegedly told a US bankruptcy court this week that the firm received reports suggesting founder Byju Raveendran was in discussions with “high-ranking Indian officials” to “make private and unofficial payments” in connection with regulatory penalties. Byju’s founders plan to initiate legal proceedings against parties involved in the US case, seeking damages of at least $2.5 billion.The remark was made during a July 15 hearing in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, where Byju’s Alpha is undergoing Chapter 11 proceedings. The claim was introduced as part of arguments seeking to amend a protective order that restricts how confidential documents obtained in US discovery can be used in enforcement actions in other countries.“We received reports that Mr. Raveendran is negotiating with high-ranking Indian officials to make substantial payments which we understand may be private and unofficial,” said Ravi Shankar, partner at Kirkland & Ellis, representing Glas Trust. No supporting evidence was filed, but the allegation was cited to argue that certain payments could potentially involve assets under litigation and therefore warrant broader disclosure access across jurisdictions.The claim comes amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny. In 2023, the Enforcement Directorate issued a Rs 9,362 crore show cause notice to Think & Learn Pvt Ltd and Mr. Raveendran for alleged violations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act.In response, the founders of Byju’s, represented by Paris-based law firm Lazareff Le Bars, said they intend to initiate legal proceedings seeking damages from parties involved in the US case. “Byju’s founders reserve all rights to bring actions against those parties that caused damage to them personally and their businesses, including Think & Learn. The conduct before the Courts by Alpha, Glas Trust and its counsel was reprehensible and improper in our view. We reserve the right to use all legal means to obtain justice for BYJU’S Founders,” said J Michael McNutt, Senior Litigation Advisor, Lazareff Le Bars.The founders are preparing claims to seek damages of no less than $2.5 billion across multiple jurisdictions, including India, as per the statement.","Byju’s founders plan to initiate legal proceedings against parties involved in the US case, seeking damages of at least $2.5 billion.

Axis Bank profit falls 4% on stricter bad loan policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/axis-bank-profit-falls-4-on-stricter-bad-loan-policy/articleshow/122705287.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Axis Bank’s net profit slipped 4% year-on-year to Rs 5,806 crore in the quarter ended June 2025, dragged down by a sharp rise in provisions. The higher provisions were due to a one-off accounting adjustment, which the bank described as a “technical impact” or an internal recalibration of its bad loan classification.This adjustment, applied to cash credit, overdraft products, and one-time settled accounts, resulted in Rs 2,709 crore of fresh slippages. That alone triggered additional provisions of Rs 821 crore. Without this, total provisions for the quarter would have been Rs 3,127 crore instead of Rs 3,948 crore. The bank noted that this hit does not signal a real decline in asset quality, calling it a “prudential application” of regulatory guidelines.The revised policy led to gross non-performing assets rising by 29 basis points quarter-on-quarter, to 1.57%. Net NPAs rose by 12 basis points to 0.45%. While the headline profit was dented by a technical recalibration, the underlying growth in revenue, loan book, and fee income paints a more balanced picture."," Axis Bank’s net profit slipped 4% year-on-year to Rs 5,806 crore in the quarter ended June 2025.

MUMBAI: Adani Enterprises will divest its remaining 30.4% stake in AWL Agri Business to Wilmar International of Singapore and institutional investors for an estimated Rs 11,080 crore, marking its complete exit from one of its earliest business ventures established at the turn of the new millennium.Earlier in Jan, it divested about a 14% stake in AWL Agri Business (previously Adani Wilmar) for Rs 4,856 crore through the offer for sale (OFS) route, signalling its withdrawal from non-core infrastructure operations. The Ahmedabad-based Adani Group already disposed of its interests in Adani Capital, Adani Housing, and the Myanmar port project.On Thursday, AWL announced that Wilmar will buy Adani Enterprises’ 20% stake in the Fortune edible oil and Kohinoor basmati rice maker for Rs 7,148 crore, raising its ownership to around 64% from the current 45%. Additionally, institutional investors will buy Adani Enterprises’ remaining 10.42% stake for an estimated Rs 3,934 crore in a separate transaction.The share transfer price is set at Rs 275 per share for both Wilmar and institutional investors, compared to the Jan OFS price of Rs 276.5. During Thursday’s trading, AWL shares on BSE rallied by over 8% to Rs 284 intraday, closing at Rs 278, up 6.1%.Following the completion of these transactions, subject to Wilmar securing anti-trust approvals, AWL will cease to be an associate company of Adani Enterprises. Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship company, intends to utilise the proceeds from the AWL divestment in airports, green hydrogen, roads, and copper operations, where it identifies significant growth potential.

"Rs 1,700 crore: Hidden cost of sending money abroad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rs-1700-crore-hidden-cost-of-sending-money-abroad/articleshow/122704967.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Families sending money abroad to support their children’s education paid an estimated Rs 1,700 crore ($200 million) in bank fees and currency markups in 2024, a report released by Redseer Strategy Consultants and Wise, a global cross-border payments company, showed.According to the study, more than 95% of India’s annual student remittances, estimated at Rs 85,000–93,500 crore ($10–11 billion), flow through traditional banks, which typically apply a 3–3.5% exchange rate markup and take between two and five days to complete transactions.Families remitting Rs 30 lakh annually can lose up to Rs 75,000 in hidden costs. The estimates of the costs tie in with what World Bank has had to say on the cost of cross border remittances. The costs are slightly lower than what migrant workers in rich countries pay to send money home. According to World Bank, the global average cost of sending $200 was 6.4% of the amount sent, a slight increase from 6.2% a year earlier.Digital remittances are significantly cheaper, averaging 5% in fees, compared with 7% for non-digital methods. This global cost remains well above the UN Sustainable Development Goal target of 3%, which aims to make remittances more affordable for migrants and their families.Wise, which sponsored the study and competes with banks on international money transfers, has an interest in drawing attention to these inefficiencies. Unlike banks that route money through multiple intermediaries, Wise maintains local pools of funds at both ends of the payment corridor. When a sender transfers money, the company uses domestic systems to disburse an equivalent amount to the recipient after receiving confirmation that funds have arrived on the sending side. This method allows Wise to offer faster transfers, at the mid-market exchange rate without markup.Conventional bank transfers involve multiple charges: sending banks add a 2–6% exchange rate markup; intermediary banks deduct $10–30 each; SWIFT levies network fees; and receiving banks may charge up to $16. These layers, along with hidden compliance costs, push total remittance costs to 5–7%, which often go unnoticed.“The stories and the sheer scale of money lost to opaque pricing should be a wake-up call,” said Taneia Bhardwaj, south Asia expansion lead at Wise.Since launching in India in 2021, Wise has seen education-related payments account for 75% of its volume from the country.According to the study, India has emerged as the largest source of international students in the US, overtaking China in 2024. Indians make up 30–35% of international student populations in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and Germany, which is up from 11% a decade ago. With overseas education spending by Indian households expected to double by 2030, the cost of remitting funds will become increasingly material.","More than 95% of India’s annual student remittances flow through traditional banks.

Wipro, India’s major IT services company, has been asked by Delhi High Court to pay Rs 2 lakh to a former employee, alleging ‘character assassination’. The court has issued a defamation ruling against Wipro regarding a contentious termination letter sent to a former employee, which contained language that was full of ‘stigma and insinuations’The court ordered Wipro to compensate Abhijit Mishra, who served as principal consultant from 2018-2020, with Rs 2 lakh as general damages to address the damage to his reputation, emotional distress, and professional standing caused by the company's actions, an ET report said.The ruling was regarding a defamation case filed by Mishra seeking damages of over Rs 2.10 crore, citing that the negative comments in his termination letter by Wipro severely affected his professional standing and hindered his ability to find new employment.Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav directed Wipro to remove the unfounded stigmatic comments about the former employee's professional conduct and issue a new termination letter, observing that the original document contained unsubstantiated negative remarks.""The remarks therein, couched in the use of the term 'malicious conduct', not only lack substantiation but also have a direct and deleterious impact on the future employability and professional dignity of the plaintiff,"" the judge ruled.Also Read | TCS gives out variable pay!

Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is to cut 500 management jobs in Britain in the wake of US tariffs and a fall in profits. On July 7 the carmaker revealed that its retail sales had plunged in three months to June 30, 2025 by 15.1% and wholesale sales were down 10.7% year-on-year.This largely reflects the planned wind down of legacy Jaguar models, ahead of the launch of new Jaguar, and a pause in shipments to the US in April 2025, following the introduction of US import tariffs, JLR said. The carmaker has largely stopped selling its Jaguar vehicles as it relaunches the brand, ahead of unveiling a new portfolio of luxury electric cars.It faced a public backlash over its controversial rebrand last year after it released a video showing models and no cars, leading to derision from Elon Musk and criticism from Nigel Farage who called it “woke.”In March US president Donald Trump announced that UK auto exports to the US faced an extra 25% tax, on top of an existing 2.5% levy. This led to JLR pausing shipments of its vehicles to the US in April. The Defender, made in Slovakia, still faces a 27.5% tariff.A JLR spokesperson told TOI: “We often offer eligible employees voluntary redundancy so this is no different to normal practice. These job losses are specific to the UK and will affect up to 500 management roles, which is only 1.5% of our UK workforce. Through this limited programme for managers, JLR is aligning its leadership workforce for the business’s current and future needs. We are grateful to the UK govt for delivering at speed the new UK-US trade deal, which gives us the confidence to invest £3.5bn per annum to realise our strategy which is delivering. ”","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is to cut 500 management jobs in Britain in the wake of US tariffs and a fall in profits.

US solar manufacturing and inflation reduction act



Next steps: Commerce department review



A coalition of leading US solar panel manufacturers has filed a formal petition urging the US commerce department to impose tariffs on solar imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos.The group alleges that producers in these countries are flooding the American market with artificially low-priced solar panels, harming the domestic solar manufacturing industry.According to a Reuters report, the petition, submitted on Thursday by the Alliance for American Solar Manufacturing and Trade, includes major industry players such as First Solar, Qcells (Hanwha’s solar division), Talon PV, and Mission Solar. The alliance claims companies in the three countries are selling solar products below production costs and are benefiting from unfair government subsidies.According to the petitioners, Chinese-owned manufacturers have shifted operations to Indonesia and Laos to circumvent existing US tariffs on imports from other Southeast Asian countries. Indian manufacturers are also accused of dumping low-cost panels into the US market.The group highlighted a dramatic rise in solar imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos — jumping from $289 million in 2022 to $1.6 billion in 2023. The surge has raised concerns among US solar producers about the impact on recent investments aimed at boosting domestic solar manufacturing.""We have always said, vigorous enforcement of our trade laws is critical to the success of this industry,” said Tim Brightbill, lead attorney for the petitioners.While the majority of solar panels installed in the US are still imported, American manufacturing capacity has expanded significantly since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. The law provides tax credits to boost domestic clean energy production and reduce dependence on Chinese-made solar panels.The US now has around 50 gigawatts of solar panel production capacity, up from 7 GW in 2020. However, demand continues to outpace supply, with installations expected to reach nearly 43 GW annually through 2030, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).The US department of commerce has 20 days to decide whether to launch an investigation into the alleged dumping and subsidy practices. If it proceeds, the case could lead to new tariffs within a year, depending on the outcome of the investigation.","A coalition of leading US solar panel manufacturers has filed a formal petition urging the US commerce department to impose tariffs on solar imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos.

Byju's founders Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath are preparing a $2.5 billion lawsuit in India and overseas as the edtech giant battles insolvency proceedings and a legal dispute with Glas Trust, trustee for Term Loan B lenders.According to their legal counsel, the planned legal action will be pursued both in India and internationally, targeting those who have allegedly harmed their reputation and business interests, including their edtech company Think & Learn.In a statement issued on Thursday by Lazareff Le Bars Eurl, Senior Litigation Advisor J Michael McNutt said, ""Byju's founders reserve all rights to bring actions against those parties that have caused damage to them personally and their businesses, including Think & Learn. The conduct before the Courts by Alpha, Glas Trust and its counsel has been reprehensible and improper in our view. We reserve the right to use all legal means to obtain justice for Byju's founders. ”Glas Trust is the trustee representing lenders to whom Byju's owes $1.2 billion. However, the founders have contested the trustee’s claims and challenged its authority. According to them, Glas Trust only represents 17.38% of the voting rights of the consortium of lenders.The founders have already filed claims in India against Glas Trust and a former subsidiary of Think & Learn, which Glas now claims to control. Additional legal action is also being prepared in other jurisdictions. The lawsuits are expected to seek damages of no less than $2.5 billion.Byju's is currently undergoing insolvency proceedings initiated by Glas Trust. Though the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had earlier dismissed the case in an appeal filed by the BCCI, Glas Trust approached the Supreme Court, which allowed the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) to continue.Byju's founders are contesting the insolvency case and have filed a plea seeking the removal of the Interim Resolution Professional, alleging a conflict of interest due to links with consultancy firm EY, which is also connected to Glas Trust.Meanwhile, Glas Trust has gained control of Byju's Alpha, a special-purpose financing vehicle created to receive Term Loan B funds. Byju's Alpha has filed a lawsuit against Raveendran, Gokulnath, and senior executive Anita Kishore, accusing them of executing a scheme to hide and misappropriate $533 million of loan proceeds.The founders’ counsel has clarified that no court, either in India or the US, has ordered the payment of any amount by Raveendran or Gokulnath to Think & Learn or its affiliates.Raveendran is currently involved in legal proceedings in a Delaware court, which began in April 2025, but has challenged the court’s jurisdiction. He has denied all allegations and is actively defending himself. He is also seeking reconsideration of a civil contempt order issued on July 7, 2025, related to the disclosure of certain information, which he claims is already under review in Indian courts.""That Civil Contempt Order concerns requests for information that are duplicative of matters already before the Indian Courts.

Leadership restructure & tariff threat





‘Reimagine’ drives smart EV charging push





Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will cut around 500 managerial jobs in the UK as part of a “limited” voluntary redundancy programme, aligning with its ongoing business transformation strategy.The move on Tuesday comes as the luxury car manufacturer aims to streamline its leadership workforce and improve efficiency amid global economic headwinds and shifting trade dynamics.JLR’s decision to reduce managerial roles follows a decline in sales during the April–June quarter, driven partly by high tariffs on exports to the US. Temporary shipment pauses to the US market earlier this year further impacted performance.A JLR spokesperson said as quoted by PTI, ""Through this limited UK VR programme for managers, JLR is aligning its leadership workforce for the business’s current and future needs.”The UK-based automaker welcomed the recent UK-US trade agreement, which reduced tariffs on British-made cars from 25% to 10% and capped duty-free exports at 100,000 units annually.“We are grateful to the government for delivering at speed the new UK-US trade deal, which gives us the confidence to invest GBP 3.5 billion per annum to realise our strategy which is delivering,” the spokesperson added.As part of its strategic shift, JLR recently halted production of most Jaguar models in preparation for a major brand relaunch in 2025. The company revealed a bold new brand identity last year, including a redesigned logo and a pink concept car.British prime minister Keir Starmer visited JLR’s headquarters in the West Midlands earlier this year to show government support. Following news of the job cuts, Downing Street stated that JLR is “responding to challenging global conditions.”In line with its long-term sustainability vision, JLR also announced a new pilot project in the UK in partnership with smart EV charging software platform ev.energy. The pilot involves 10 electric Jaguar I‑PACE vehicles and aims to develop efficient, cost-saving smart charging solutions.“Together, we are designing and deploying a smart charging solution that will meet our luxury clients’ expectations. It will support the transition to electrification through the efficient use of energy, ” said Swarna Ramanathan, Chief Strategy Officer at JLR, as reported by PTI.JLR’s transformation is part of its broader ‘Reimagine’ strategy, which aims to make the company carbon net zero by 2039 across its supply chain, products, and operations. The automaker plans to offer fully electric models across all brands, with Jaguar becoming all-electric by the end of this decade.",Jaguar Land Rover will cut around 500 managerial jobs in the UK as part of a “limited” voluntary redundancy programme.

TACO vs WACO: How Donald Trump’s tariff war turned into a windfall for US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-taco-us-tariff-war-trump-trade-war-waco-tariff-windfall-for-us/articleshow/122644583.cms,"TL;DR

Trump’s tariffs have brought the US a record surge in customs revenue-$64 billion in Q2 2025.

The US is effectively using its dominant consumer market position as leverage in trade disputes.

Global supply chains are absorbing some costs, and many global brands are spreading tariff price hikes across markets, not just US consumers.

The strategy has led to only modest inflation so far but hints of rising prices in tariff-affected goods are emerging.

The world is watching what happens as the next tariff deadlines approach, with the risk of escalation always present.

For now, Trump’s approach is delivering short-term wins, but long-term costs and risks are quietly building beneath the surface.

TACO vs WACO: When tariffs roared and the world whispered

Why it matters

The world’s reluctance to hit back reflects the dominant economic clout of the US as the world’s largest consumer market, the complexity of global supply chains, and the political and security considerations driving some US allies to tread cautiously.

For now, the US is collecting billions in additional revenue and maintaining leverage as it pushes trade partners toward better terms.

The lack of retaliation offers Trump clear political cover to double down ahead of his August 1 tariff escalation deadline. Countries like the EU and Mexico have opted for diplomatic delay tactics rather than confrontation.

But economists warn that the costs-rising consumer prices, potential business cutbacks, and slower job growth-may quietly mount over time, sounding a cautionary note on the sustainability of Trump’s tariff strategy.

The reluctant retaliators

The economic case for chickening out

Tariffs beginning to bite, but not break

While inflation remains manageable, early signs show tariffs are quietly pushing prices up on key imported goods like furniture and clothing, per June inflation data.

UBS reported the fastest price jump in core goods (excluding autos) in three years

Economists estimate tariffs could eventually shave $2,800/year off US household income

“Tariffs are beginning to bite,” said Omair Sharif of Inflation Insights.

“It could become self-reinforcing,” added economist Isabella Weber of UMass Amherst.

Fed officials acknowledge the impact is just beginning. “It’s still early days for the effects of tariffs,” said New York Fed President John Williams this week. “I expect those effects to increase in coming months.”

The full burden is not landing at once, as brands and retailers distribute costs globally or absorb them with slimmer margins. “Global brands can try and swallow some of the tariff cost through smart sourcing and cost savings but the majority will have to be distributed across other markets, because US consumers might swallow a 5 per cent increase, but not 20 or even 40,” Simon Geale of supply chain consultancy Proxima told FT.

Major US banks, flush with profits, note that consumer resilience has so far exceeded expectations, though Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser cautioned, “We have seen pauses in capex and hiring amongst our client base.”

Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf added: “Many have found ways to avoid passing the 10% tariffs on to their customers... they are preparing for the downside and are not growing inventories or hiring aggressively.”

What’s next?

It's $50 billion and counting: President Donald Trump ’s aggressive tariff campaign has, so far, yielded significant financial gains for the US government.The summer of 2025 finds America emboldened, its trade war chest swelling as most foreign capitals recoil from Trump’s escalating tariff agenda. Four months after launching sweeping tariffs-10% on global imports, 50% on steel and aluminum, and 25% on autos-America’s trading partners have, largely, folded rather than fought.Only China and Canada have dared retaliation, but both have retreated under pressure, wary of a president whose critics once jeered him as ""Trump always chickens out (TACO).” Instead, Trump has pocketed nearly $50 billion in extra customs revenues, racking up a record $64 billion in duties during the last quarter alone, according to a Financial Times report.As per the Financial Times reports: “Only China and Canada have dared to hit back at Washington,” with the duties imposed worldwide on American exports representing “a tiny fraction of the US revenue during the same period.” Instead of a global front, most nations opted for negotiation and delay, with the European Union repeatedly deferring countermeasures in hopes of securing a deal by Trump’s self-imposed August deadline.So far, it seems to be a case of WACO-World always chickens out and not TACO.As per the FT report, even China - the world’s export giant - only managed a 1.9% increase in customs receipts from its counter-tariffs this past year-an anemic haul compared to the US surge. In May, Chinese exports to the US cratered by a third after tariffs soared to 145%, before both countries agreed to a 90-day pause, dialing rates back to 30%.Canada’s bravado proved similarly fleeting: after imposing C$155 billion in retaliatory tariffs, Prime Minister Mark Carney retreated, axing a digital services tax and declining to mirror Trump’s latest tariff hikes. As Dan Nowlan, a Canadian political adviser, put it: “Carney’s ‘elbows up’ rhetoric worked during the election campaign, but we can’t be confrontational with the US. It’s now a much more realist approach. ”For many countries, submission has been less about courage and more about cold calculus. “Unlike the 1930s when countries had more balanced trading relationships, today’s world features a hub-and-spoke system with the US at the centre,” Marta Bengoa of City University of New York told FT. “That makes retaliation economically less desirable for most countries, even when it might be politically satisfying.”While the specter of retaliatory spirals haunts the halls of history, today’s global order is different. “I’d like to think leaders were learning the lessons of history, but I fear that’s optimistic,” Alexander Klein, economic historian at the University of Sussex, told FT. “More likely, the EU, Canada and many other governments fear the hit to global supply linkages and inflation from escalation. Trump cares less about that, so is taking advantage. ”Between the threat of lost access to the world’s largest consumer market and the risk of still higher tariffs, America’s partners have chosen deterrence by deference. The EU’s latest list of potential counter-tariffs, targeting €72 billion in US goods, notably omitted specific rates-a peace offering to avoid Trump’s ire.In a phrase that captures the nervous uncertainty, an EU official acknowledged that trade talks now “affect the whole spectrum of US relations including those regarding security,” particularly at a time when Europe needs support for Ukraine.Trump is pressing hard for more deals. In an interview, he claimed deals with India are “very close” and suggested a possible agreement with the EU, though talks with Canada remain uncertain.Meanwhile, the White House is preparing to impose 10% to 15% tariffs on over 150 smaller countries as part of a broader trade shakeup, signaling continuing pressure on global supply chains, a Bloomberg report said.Whether the rest of the world will muster unified resistance remains to be seen. Diplomatic sources note that the August 1 tariff deadline is a critical moment: if Trump raises tariffs to 30% as threatened, the EU and others may feel they “have nothing to lose,” potentially sparking a more intense conflict. For now, the trending strategy has been de-escalation and negotiation, not retaliation.(With inputs from agencies)","The US is effectively using its dominant consumer market position as leverage in trade disputes.

More than 400 subsea cables currently carry 99% of the world’s international internet traffic, and US officials have cited broad data security concerns regarding this vast network, Reuters reported.Back since 2020, US regulators have played a major role in halting four proposed cables intended to link the US with Hong Kong.Last year, the FCC signalled it was considering new rules to govern the operation of undersea internet cables amid growing national security risks.That included a review of whether equipment or services provided by companies deemed threats to US security, such as Huawei, ZTE, China Telecom and China Mobile, should be banned from use in subsea cable systems.Carr emphasised the urgency of protecting this infrastructure, stating the FCC is moving to safeguard undersea cables from both cyber and physical risks tied to foreign adversaries. The agency also said it will seek public comment on potential additional measures to bolster the security of submarine cable systems against equipment from such entities.Recent events have highlighted these concerns.In the Baltic Sea, the cutting of two fibre-optic undersea cables led to investigations into possible sabotage. In 2023, Taiwan accused two Chinese ships of severing the only internet cables connecting the Matsu Islands.More recently, Houthi attacks in the Red Sea are suspected to have caused damage to three critical cables supplying internet service to Europe and Asia.","The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced on Wednesday that it plans to introduce new rules to block companies from connecting undersea communication cables to the United States.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

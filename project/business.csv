TCS Layoffs: NITES Wants Halt On Terminations

Other Trade Unions Also Slam TCS

TCS layoffs: The news of TCS planning to sack thousands of employees has led to Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) writing to Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya . India’s biggest IT services firm, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Sunday said it would be laying off around 12,000 employees over the course of the year, which means an approximate 2% cut in its workforce.With this TCS is set to implement its biggest workforce reduction ever. Previously, the company had terminated approximately 3,000 employees in 2015, which was around 1% of its total staff at that time. This is reportedly the biggest mass layoff that the Indian IT industry is set to witness.NITES, an IT workers' union, has written a letter to Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, voicing concerns regarding the mass sackings announced by Tata Consultancy Services.According to an ET report, the IT workers' organisation challenged the legality of these dismissals and requested official instructions be issued to TCS to ""halt all terminations and reinstate affected employees.""Also Read | TCS layoffs ‘biggest ever’ for Indian IT! Artificial Intelligence not to blame for ‘difficult’ decision? Top 10 things to know about mass sackings The union emphasised that permitting a corporation of TCS's magnitude to conduct large-scale layoffs and firings without proper procedures or accountability would establish the wrong standard for other organisations, leading to employment uncertainty, diminished worker protections, and reduced confidence in India's labour environment.NITES urged the Ministry to hold the company's senior leadership responsible, particularly given the CEO's salary increase during a period of widespread job cuts.According to TCS's annual report, CEO K Krithivasan received Rs 26.5 crore in FY25, representing a 4.6% increase from the previous financial year. The report indicated that his compensation was 329.8 times the median employee salary.Additionally, NITES called for an investigation into TCS's delayed onboarding practices. Earlier this month, the union had highlighted concerns regarding delays in the lateral recruitment of 600 professionals.IT sector employee unions have labelled the dismissals unlawful and encouraged TCS staff facing redundancy to resist resignation pressures. The Karnataka State IT/ITeS Employees Union has appealed to the technology major to withdraw its staff reduction strategy and restore positions of impacted workers.The Forum for IT Employees (FITE) has recommended that TCS should avoid applying direct pressure on employees to resign. Instead, they advised the company to provide notice period remuneration, severance packages and extend health insurance benefits for a 12-month period.Also Read | ‘Don’t resign under pressure….’: TCS layoffs opposed by IT employee unions; IT giant to sack 12,000 employees","NITES, an IT workers' union, has written a letter to Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, voicing concerns regarding the mass sackings.

India-US Trade Deal: Talks Continue

India-US trade deal: In an indication that a trade deal between India and the US was less likely ahead of Donald Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline, an American top official has said that more negotiations are required.According to a Bloomberg report, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said that ""more negotiations"" are required between the two countries even as talks continue. Greer’s statement comes days ahead of US President Donald Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline, post which countries face higher tariffs.Since India did not receive any tariff letter from Trump, it is yet unclear whether the 26% tariff rate announced for India on April 2 will kick in from August 1 or not.Trump has additionally warned of implementing ""secondary tariffs"" on countries such as India and China for their Russian oil purchases.Also Read | India-US trade deal: India treads cautiously after Trump’s trade agreements with Japan, others face challenges - here’s what’s happening Although India was one of the initial countries to initiate trade discussions with the White House this year, it has hardened its stance especially on agriculture and dairy sectors.In a CNBC interview on Monday, Greer spoke of the need for further discussions to seal a trade deal.Despite his earlier hints at an imminent agreement with New Delhi, he emphasised that India's traditional stance of market protection meant that any reduction in trade barriers would signify a significant policy shift.""We continue to speak with our Indian counterparts, we've always had very constructive discussions with them,"" Greer said.""They have expressed strong interest in opening portions of their market, we of course are willing to continue talking to them,"" Greer said.

Trump tariffs take effect Friday: 5 key imports face steep hikes; economic fallout looms for US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariffs-take-effect-friday-5-key-imports-face-steep-hikes-economic-fallout-looms/articleshow/122987260.cms,"AI-generated image

Key products affected

Coffee

Brazil, accounting for over 30 per cent of US imports, will face a 50 per cent tariff from August 1. Trump announced the rate in a letter to Brazil’s leadership, referencing what he called a judicial “witch hunt” against his ally, ex-president Jair Bolsonaro.





Vietnam, despite a recent agreement with Trump, will see a 20 per cent tariff imposed.





Apparel

Chinese goods, nearly one-third of the total, now carry a new 30 per cent duty—on top of existing tariffs. If the current tariff truce lapses on August 12, duties may rise further.





Vietnam and Bangladesh face 20 per cent and 35 per cent tariffs, respectively, under Trump’s latest proposals.





Jasmine rice

Thailand will face a 36 per cent duty, India 26 per cent, and Pakistan 29 per cent starting Friday.





Cocoa

Ivory Coast faces a 21 per cent tariff.





Cocoa butter imports worth $576 million, primarily from Indonesia and Malaysia, will now face duties of 19 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.





Electronics and raw materials

The construction sector—using 42 per cent of domestic copper—along with electronics manufacturing, is expected to face the brunt of rising input costs.

The US plans to impose higher tariffs on several major trading partners starting Friday unless new agreements are reached with President Donald Trump- raising concerns over rising consumer prices and economic strain.Financial experts warn the proposed tariffs, which must be paid by importers of foreign goods, will likely increase operating costs and reduce household spending—potentially dampening consumption, a key driver of the US economy.The National Coffee Association says the US imports over 99 per cent of its coffee, with two-thirds of American adults drinking it daily. Top suppliers include Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam.According to the American Apparel & Footwear Association, China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh supplied over half of US apparel imports from January to May.The US is the largest rice importer in the Western Hemisphere, with over 1.3 million tonnes annually—more than 60 per cent of it being aromatic varieties like jasmine and basmati.USDA data shows cocoa bean imports—mainly from Ivory Coast and Ecuador—averaged over $1.1 billion annually (2017–2021).Trump has also proposed a sweeping 50 per cent tariff on copper imports from August 1. According to BCG, this could add $8.6 billion to the cost of imported copper, with further increases possible if extended to related products.","The US plans to impose higher tariffs on several major trading partners starting Friday unless new agreements are reached with President Donald Trump.

""Driven by intense competitive pressures and a desire to project short-term success, the management of certain banks and NBFCs appear to believe that the ends justify the means,"" he said. ""Practices such as creative accounting, liberal interpretations of regulations, lenient policy frameworks, and inadequate internal controls are being normalised in some boardrooms-necessitating supervisory intervention.""While he did not name specific institutions, the message was aimed at reminding the industry of the RBI's stance on governance and ethical conduct.

Skywatchers are in for a rare celestial spectacle as two meteor showers—the Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids—are set to peak on July 29–30, 2025. With an expected 25 meteors per hour and a moonless sky ensuring perfect visibility, this year’s event promises breathtaking views for both astronomy enthusiasts and casual stargazers. Best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere but visible globally, this dual meteor shower display will deliver stunning streaks of light, fireballs, and long meteor trails. Here’s everything you need to know about the peak timings, origins, and best viewing tips for this remarkable event.The simultaneous peak of two meteor showers, combined with a favourable moon phase, makes 2025 a standout year for meteor enthusiasts. Whether you’re an experienced astronomer or simply love stargazing, this event offers one of the best opportunities to witness natural fireworks lighting up the night sky.The Southern Delta Aquariids, active from July 18 to August 12, will be the primary highlight of this cosmic event. Known for their faint yet persistent trails, these meteors are expected to produce 20 meteors per hour during the peak. Originating from Comet 96P/Machholz, these meteors have been gracing Earth’s skies annually as our planet passes through the comet’s debris field. This year’s activity coincides with a darker moon phase, offering stargazers a clearer, more vivid view of these delicate celestial streaks.Adding variety to the spectacle, the Alpha Capricornids will contribute an additional five to 10 meteors per hour. While fewer in number, this shower is famous for its slow-moving, bright fireballs that often appear colourful and dramatic. These meteors come from Comet 169P/NEAT, which completes its orbit every 4.2 years, leaving behind striking debris trails. Together, they promise a captivating experience for astronomy enthusiasts, photographers, and casual skywatchers eager for a midsummer night’s dazzling natural show.Although visible in both hemispheres, the Southern Hemisphere offers the best vantage point due to the higher elevation of the Aquarius and Capricornus constellations. Northern Hemisphere viewers should look southward during predawn hours for the best chance to witness the showers. A moonless night and minimal light pollution will further enhance visibility, making rural areas ideal for observation.Unlike meteor showers with only a brief peak, the Southern Delta Aquariids provide an extended window of high activity from July 24 to July 31. This means even if weather conditions block the peak night, skywatchers have several opportunities to enjoy the display.","The Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids are set to peak on July 29–30, 2025.

US-China trade deal talks: Following discussions in Stockholm, China's chief trade representative announced on Tuesday that China and the United States have decided to maintain their existing tariff arrangements, extending the pause.The latest negotiations between Chinese and US trade representatives took place in the Swedish capital across Monday and Tuesday, aiming to resolve the tariff deadlock that has affected trade relations between the world's largest economies.According to an AP report, Li Chenggang said that both countries engaged in ""constructive"" and ""candid"" talks, confirming that current tariff rates would remain unchanged - with the United States maintaining its 30% levy on Chinese imports whilst China continues its 10% duty on American goods.He further noted that both parties conducted thorough discussions on microeconomic matters, with an agreement to maintain regular contact and ensure prompt communication regarding trade and economic concerns.Since US President Donald Trump's announcement of ""Liberation Day"" tariffs affecting numerous countries in April, the United States has established trade agreements with several major trading allies, including Britain, Japan and the European Union.The situation with China remains the most significant unresolved matter.The initial negotiations extended for approximately five hours in a private session at the Swedish prime minister's office on Monday.

"Donald Trump’s tariffs to hit less than expected! IMF raises global growth forecast to 3% for 2025; India, US, China see upgrades",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-tariffs-to-hit-less-than-expected-imf-raises-global-growth-forecast-to-3-for-2025-india-us-china-see-upgrades/articleshow/122979935.cms,"AI image

US, China, India growth forecast raised

Global inflation seen easing, but US could remain above target

IMF flags downside risks if trade shocks worsen

Markets, central banks in spotlight

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday upgraded its global growth outlook for 2025, projecting a 3% expansion—up 0.2 percentage points from its April forecast—as early stockpiling ahead of US tariffs, a weaker dollar, and improved financial conditions help cushion the blow of American President Donald Trump's sweeping trade measures.Growth for 2026 was also raised marginally to 3.1%, according to the IMF’s July update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO). “This reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading in anticipation of higher tariffs; lower average effective US tariff rates than announced in April; an improvement in financial conditions, including due to a weaker US dollar; and fiscal expansion in some major jurisdictions,” the IMF said.The US economy is now expected to grow 1.9% in 2025 and 2% in 2026, bolstered in part by fiscal expansion, including the effects of Trump’s tax cuts. China’s forecast was revised up sharply to 4.8%, from 4% earlier, on the back of lower-than-expected US tariffs and higher public spending. India will likely retain its crown as the world’s fastest-growing major economy, with projected growth of 6.4% in both 2025 and 2026, up 0.2% from the previous April estimates.Euro area growth is now seen at 1% in 2025, up from 0.8%, led by a surge in pharmaceutical exports from Ireland ahead of new US drug tariffs. Japan continues to lag with sub-1% growth expectations.IMF expects global headline inflation to decline to 4.2% in 2025 and further to 3.6% in 2026, broadly in line with its April estimates. However, the IMF warned of diverging trends. “The overall picture hides notable cross-country differences, with forecasts predicting inflation will remain above target in the United States and be more subdued in other large economies.”While the tone of the update was cautiously optimistic, the IMF flagged significant risks to the outlook. “Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, as they were in the April 2025 WEO,” the report noted.“A rebound in effective tariff rates could lead to weaker growth. Elevated uncertainty could start weighing more heavily on activity, also as deadlines for additional tariffs expire without progress on substantial, permanent agreements,” the IMF said, warning that geopolitical tensions may disrupt global supply chains and fuel commodity price spikes.The IMF cautioned that rising fiscal deficits or greater risk aversion could lift long-term interest rates and trigger financial volatility. “Combined with fragmentation concerns, this could reignite volatility in financial markets,” it said.On the other hand, progress on the trade front could deliver upside surprises: “Global growth could be lifted if trade negotiations lead to a predictable framework and to a decline in tariffs,” the IMF said.Calling for a coordinated global policy response, the Fund urged governments to ensure “confidence, predictability, and sustainability by calming tensions, preserving price and financial stability, restoring fiscal buffers, and implementing much-needed structural reforms.”","IMF upgrades global growth outlook for 2025, projecting a 3% expansion.

Railroad consolidation push: Union Pacific proposes $85bn merger with Norfolk Southern to create first US transcontinental network; STB nod seen as key hurdle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/railroad-consolidation-push-union-pacific-proposes-85bn-merger-with-norfolk-southern-to-create-first-us-transcontinental-network-stb-nod-seen-as-key-hurdle/articleshow/122979265.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Union Pacific on Tuesday announced an $85 billion proposal to acquire Norfolk Southern, a move that would create the first coast-to-coast freight railroad in the US and could potentially trigger a final wave of consolidation in the rail industry.The merger would link Union Pacific’s vast network across the western US with Norfolk Southern’s operations in 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia. While the US has been connected by rail since 1869, no single company has ever operated a unified transcontinental route, AP reported.Union Pacific said the deal would streamline logistics by removing delays that occur when goods are handed off between carriers, enhancing delivery speed and reliability. “It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln’s vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,” said Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena.Under the proposal, Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive $88.82 in cash and one Union Pacific share for each share held — valuing NS at about $320 a share. Norfolk Southern’s stock closed at just over $260 earlier this month before reports of a potential deal emerged.Following the announcement, Union Pacific shares slipped nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trade, while Norfolk Southern fell over 3% to $277.40.Regulatory approval from the US Surface Transportation Board (STB) will be critical. The STB, currently split 2-2 between Republicans and Democrats, has been cautious in recent years, with the fallout from past mergers—such as Union Pacific's 1996 tie-up with Southern Pacific—prompting stricter oversight. President Trump is expected to appoint a fifth member before the deal is reviewed.If approved, the deal could intensify pressure on rivals BNSF and CSX to pursue their own consolidation. Analysts say the move could reshape US freight logistics, particularly if Canadian players like CN or CPKC enter the fray. The Canadian rails already have cross-border networks feeding into US trade flows, with CPKC extending into Mexico.Some shippers, including chemical firms in the Gulf, may oppose the deal over monopoly concerns. Others, like Amazon and UPS, may back it if it improves delivery timelines and reliability. The STB will consider inputs from unions, customers, and local communities before issuing a verdict.Union Pacific said the combined entity could generate $1.75 billion in new annual revenue and eliminate $1 billion in costs. It also assured that no union jobs would be lost.Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George said the companies would spend the next two years preparing integration plans. “We’re committed to making sure [congestion] doesn’t happen in this case,” he said, referring to past disruptions caused by major rail mergers.The last major US rail deal was approved two years ago, when Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern to form CPKC. That $31 billion merger created a network spanning Canada, the US, and Mexico.On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern posted a Q2 profit of $768 million, or $3.41 per share, up from $737 million a year ago. Adjusted EPS stood at $3.29, narrowly missing analyst expectations of $3.31. Volumes rose 3% year-on-year, but the quarter included one-time costs linked to the 2023 East Palestine derailment and internal restructuring.","Union Pacific on Tuesday announced an $85 billion proposal to acquire Norfolk Southern.

"Proctor and Gamble picks IIM alumnus Shailesh Jejurikar as CEO, putting him 'Head&Shoulders' above US executives",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/proctor-and-gamble-picks-iim-alumnus-shailesh-jejurikar-as-ceo-putting-him-headshoulders-above-us-executives/articleshow/122978897.cms,"File photo: IIM alumnus Shailesh Jejurikar

As P&G’s chief, Jejurikar has to ‘tide’ over tariffs, slowdown in US



Procter & Gamble (P&G), the storied consumer goods company that put Gillette and Old Spice, Crest and Vicks, Head&Shoulders and Pantene, Olay and Oral-b, Pampers and Tampax, among other products on the world’s store shelves, has named Mumbai-born Shailesh Jejurikar as its next CEO.Jejurikar, 58, an alumnus of Hyderabad Public School (and a classmate of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella), Mumbai University, and IIM Lucknow (1989), will succeed Jon Moeller, who will transition to the role of executive chairman, the company said in an announcement. He will be the first Asian and Indian CEO minted entirely in the Indian education system to helm the 188-year-old company, whose founding pre-dates Abraham Lincoln’s tenure as US president.P&G is the only company Jejurikar has worked at in a 36-year career that began when he was recruited from IIM Lucknow in 1989 as an assistant brand manager, skin care, rising to marketing director for India a decade later.Founded in 1837 by candlemaker William Procter and soap maker James Gamble, the $84bn P&G is currently 51st in the Fortune 500.Following the announcement that he will be the FMCG giant’s next CEO, Shailesh Jejurikar, in a statement, said, “I am honoured to serve as P&G’s CEO.P&G people, our brands and our capabilities in innovation and operational excellence fuel my confidence for a future of sustained growth and value-creation.”His transition to the global workplace began in 2010 when he was appointed vice-president for home care, North America, before being named CEO of P&G’s fabric & home care, the company’s largest business sector, in 2019. It includes iconic brands like Tide, Ariel, Downy, Gain, Febreze, and Swiffer.In 2021, he was appointed P&G’s first-ever chief operating officer to oversee a broad portfolio including P&G’s enterprise markets (Latin America, India, Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe), as well as critical company-wide functions such as sales, market operations, purchasing, and manufacturing.Jejurikar’s elevation comes at a time of rampant nativism in middle America, where he currently lives (in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is P&G’s headquarters). While 90% of P&G products sold in the US are made in America, allaying President Trump’s rage about cheap foreign products, many in his MAGA base are resentful of foreign-born CEOs like Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai despite their critical role in growing the US economy and their ties to India, providing an opening to a fast-growing market.About 48% of P&G’s revenue is from the US market and 52% from the rest of the world. More than 20 P&G products have global revenues of more than $1 billion each. Its India revenues have been growing fast and topped $2 billion recently, even as sales in the US are slowing down. P&G on Tuesday reported global net sales of $84.3 billion in FY25, unchanged over last year, and forecast 1-5% sales growth for FY26. The broader outlook, the firm said, includes “around $1 billion before tax, or approximately $800 million after tax in higher costs from tariffs”.P&G has also set in motion an internal restructuring, as part of which it will cut up to 7,000 (non-manufacturing) jobs globally over two years and exit some product categories and brands in select markets. For the first quarter of 2025, overall real personal consumption expenditures rose 1.2% at annual rates in the US, well below the 4% growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024, analysts at Deloitte said in a note last month, adding that consumer spending is expected to remain subdued going into 2026.While India-born CEOs in the tech sector is now a familiar story (Microsoft, Google, IBM, Adobe Systems, YouTube, Micron all have Indian CEOs), there are also several desi CEOs in the broader market. Among them are Raj Subramaniam, who’s leading FedEx; Vivek Sankaran, helming grocery chain Albertsons; Vasant Narasimhan at Novartis, and Leena Nair, who runs France’s global luxury brand Chanel.Jejurikar is married to Sankhya, a visual artist, and they have two sons.News of Jejurikar’s elevation triggered delight in the Indian corporate sector, now positioned as a global crucible for leadership.“Shailesh Jejurikar’s appointment as CEO proves yet again that Indian-American leaders can navigate not just tech, but the hearts and minds of US consumers. And this news has special meaning for us at @MahindraRise because Shailesh happens to be the younger brother of our very own Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director and CEO (auto & farm sector) M&M Ltd,” business patriarch Anand Mahindra noted.","Shailesh Jejurikar, 58, will succeed Jon Moeller, who will transition to the role of executive chairman.

On an adjusted basis, Boeing reported a loss of $1.24 per share, better than the $1.54 loss forecast by Zacks analysts. Boeing shares rose over 2% in premarket trading on Tuesday.Despite the improved performance, the company remains under pressure on multiple fronts. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in June cited “lapses in Boeing’s manufacturing and safety oversight” as contributing to the door plug panel detachment on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 flight in January 2024. Boeing said it would review the NTSB findings and continue to strengthen safety and quality.Separately, the Department of Justice reached a settlement in May that allowed Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution for misleading regulators ahead of the fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, which claimed 346 lives. The Max series has remained a key source of concern for both regulators and investors.On the labour front, Boeing said Sunday that more than 3,200 union workers at three St. Louis-area plants—responsible for manufacturing US fighter jets—are poised to strike on August 4.

"Tariff impact: Donald Trump’s new import duties could push US factory costs up to 4.5%, economists warn; flag risks to jobs, AI growth and margins",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariff-impact-donald-trumps-new-import-duties-could-push-us-factory-costs-up-to-4-5-economists-warn-flag-risks-to-jobs-ai-growth-and-margins/articleshow/122975868.cms,"AI image

As President Donald Trump prepares to implement a sweeping set of new import tariffs starting August 1, a new analysis suggests these policies could significantly strain US manufacturers by raising their costs between 2% and 4.5%. The research, conducted by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, warns that such increases may crimp already-thin profit margins, potentially leading to stagnation in wages, layoffs, or even plant closures.“There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said researcher Chris Bangert-Drowns, quoted AP. “Those seemingly small changes could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants.""Trump has unveiled new trade frameworks with the EU, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the UK, each featuring import duties ranging from 15% to 50%. The administration argues these tariffs will reduce the budget deficit and bolster domestic manufacturing. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.However, the new analysis highlights how manufacturers are also bearing the brunt.“We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Michigan, which has seen steel coil prices rise 5–10% despite not using imported steel. Trump’s tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium — now at 50% — have allowed US producers to hike prices due to reduced competition, Johnson said, AP reported.A June survey by the Atlanta Fed found that companies planned to pass half of the new tariff burden onto consumers. The Labor Department reported a loss of 14,000 US manufacturing jobs following the April tariff rollout.In Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in sectors exposed to Trump’s trade duties, including construction, manufacturing, and oil. Even AI investments — which Trump recently promoted as America’s economic future — face hurdles, with 20% of electronics inputs reliant on imports.The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that households could lose up to $2,400 annually due to the tariffs. Economist Ernie Tedeschi disputed the Trump administration’s claim that inflation is under control, stating that import prices have been accelerating despite contrary conclusions by the Council of Economic Advisers.Small business owners such as Josh Smith of Montana Knife Co. said the tariffs are affecting expansion plans. Smith paid $77,250 in import duties on a $515,000 German machine he needs for knife production — enough to hire a new worker, he said. With no American alternative, Smith said tariffs are “the difference between hiring people and standing still.”Trump's legal justification for the new tariffs under ""emergency"" powers is now being challenged in court, even as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed the global community is “willing to pay a toll” to maintain access to US markets.But for small firms like Smith’s, the toll may be too steep. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do,” he said.","US manufacturers could see costs rise between 2% and 4.5% due to new import tariffs. Research conducted by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth warns that such increases may crimp already-thin profit margins. The Labor Department reported a loss of 14,000 US manufacturing jobs following the April tariff rollout.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122975916,imgsize-858829,width-400,resizemode-4/122975916.jpg"

Russia Unleashes Fire On Ukraine; Dozens Killed & Injured In Strikes On Residential Areas, Hospital

ALMATY: Kazakhstan said on Tuesday the European Union has approved the Central Asian country exporting coal through Russian ports, despite sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.Kazakhstan, the EU's largest Central Asian trading partner, is rich in natural resources, but is forced to export the vast majority of its production through Russia because it's landlocked.After Brussels' latest sanctions package on Russia, ""the European side introduced amendments providing for an exception to the ban on transactions with certain Russian ports for the transit of Kazakh coal,"" Kazakhstan's trade ministry said in a statement.In March, the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, had already suggested that Kazakhstan, the fifth largest supplier of coal to the EU, could benefit from an exception.Coal from Kazakhstan made up 6.5 percent of EU's imports of the commodity in the first quarter of this year, according to the European Commission.According to the Kazakh authorities, the waiver is valid if the coal comes exclusively from Kazakhstan, is not owned by an entity under sanctions and if Russian ports are only used for transit.Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent ban on imports of Russian natural resources into the EU, the bloc has sought to strengthen its ties with Kazakhstan, especially in the energy sector.But this former Soviet republic remains a close ally of Russia, with which it shares some 7,500 kilometres (4,700 miles) of border.Western countries accuse it of flouting sanctions by allowing sanctioned goods to flow through the lengthy border, a claim Astana denies.","Kazakhstan, the EU's largest Central Asian trading partner, is rich in natural resources.

Singapore's Bombshell Declaration Against Trump Tariffs; 'We Will Fight, Win & Emerge Stronger'

US President Donald Trump 's approach to global trade policy is yielding results with international partners. Nations including the European Union , Japan and Vietnam are accepting elevated tariffs for access to American markets. This strategy, rooted in Trump's protectionist views, represents a significant economic and political venture regarding American consumer interests.The United States and the European Union reached a trade agreement where the EU accepted 15% US tariffs on most goods. The EU also committed to purchasing $750 billion in US energy products and making $600 billion in new investments through 2028, according to White House figures.""We just signed a very big trade deal, the biggest of them all,"" Trump said Monday.The framework agreement's success remains uncertain, with minimal detail provided. Traditional trade agreements typically require extensive negotiations spanning months or years, with outcomes dependent on specific details.Financial markets have adapted to the highest US import tariffs in approximately 90 years, following initial concerns about protectionist policies.The US Treasury is receiving substantial revenue from foreign goods levies, potentially offsetting recent tax reductions signed on July 4.Economic experts suggest these high tariffs could increase consumer prices, affect Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, and reduce US economic efficiency. Democratic opponents argue these costs will primarily impact lower and middle-income Americans.""It's pretty striking that it's seen as a sigh of relief moment,"" said Daniel Hornung, a former Biden White House economic official who now holds fellowships at Housing Finance Policy Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as reported by AP. ""But if the new baseline across all trading partners is 15%, that is a meaningful drag on growth that increases recession risks, while simultaneously making it harder for the Fed to cut. ""Trump has long argued that America erred by not fully utilising its position as the world’s largest economy and imposing extensive tariffs, thereby compelling other nations to secure access to the U.S. consumer market.To his close aides, Trump’s implementation of tariffs has affirmed their confidence in his negotiating abilities and dismissed the warnings of economists who predicted economic downturns and inflation. The S&P 500 stock index remained largely unchanged on Monday, although equities have since recovered from the tariff-induced decline in April.“Where are the ‘experts’ now?” Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick posted on X.However, the situation remains unresolved. Many aspects of Trump’s trade agreements are still unclear and have not been formally documented. The US and Japan, for example, have provided differing accounts of Japan’s commitment to invest Rs 45.65 lakh crore in the United States.“The trade deals do seem to count as a qualified win for Trump, with other countries giving the US favourable trade terms while accepting US tariffs,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, as quoted by AP. “However, certain terms of the deals, such as other countries’ investments in the US, seem more promising in the abstract than they might prove in reality over time.""Trump is facing legal challenges from states and businesses contending that the president exceeded his authority by declaring national emergencies to justify tariffs on most global economies. In May, a federal court invalidated these tariffs. An appeals court, which has permitted the government to continue collecting the tariffs temporarily, is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Thursday.Additionally, Trump has yet to finalise an agreement with China, which has effectively employed retaliatory tariffs and the withholding of rare earth mineral exports—essential for electric vehicles, computer chips and wind turbines—to resist Trump’s demands. The U.S. and China are scheduled to engage in talks this week in Stockholm, Sweden.Additionally, there is doubt that the tariffs will generate the economic growth Trump has advocated.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said, “the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation,” but not a recession. After all, the 15% tariffs on the EU and Japan represent a modest increase from the 10% rate initiated by Trump in April during the negotiation phase.While automobiles produced in the EU and Japan will no longer be subject to the 25% tariffs Trump previously imposed, they will still incur a 15% tax that has not yet been reflected in prices at US dealerships. The administration has suggested that the absence of higher auto prices indicates that foreign manufacturers are absorbing the costs, but it may ultimately indicate the accumulation of auto inventories intended to preempt the import taxes.“Dealers built stocks ahead of tariff implementation, damping the immediate impact on retail prices. That cushion is starting to wear thin,” Morgan Stanley stated in a separate report. “Our Japan auto analyst notes that as pre-tariff inventory clears, replacement vehicles will likely carry higher price tags.”Mary Lovely, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, cautioned about a “slow-burn efficiency loss” as US companies struggle to adapt to Trump’s new policies. For decades, American firms have generally paid uniform tariffs – and often none at all – on imported machinery and raw materials globally.Now, due to Trump’s trade agreements, tariffs vary by country. “US firms have to change their designs and source inputs from different locations based on these variable tariff rates,” she said. “It’s an incredible administrative burden. These factors act as longer-term drags on the economy, but their effects will emerge only gradually.”","US President Donald Trump's approach to global trade policy is yielding results with international partners.

Tech Rally Drives Momentum

Commodities and currency moves

Asian markets broadly declined on Tuesday, as initial optimism surrounding newly proposed trade agreements with Japan and the European Union by US President Donald Trump began to fade.Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped nearly 0.7 per cent to 40,725.23, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.3 per cent to 8,670.50. South Korea’s Kospi managed to recover from earlier losses, ending flat with a marginal gain of less than 0.1 per cent at 3,212.59.In China, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.1 per cent to 25,276.36, and the Shanghai Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 3,586.93.Analysts said investors turned cautious as attention shifted to ongoing trade discussions between the US and China. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Sweden, though no major breakthroughs were reported. Bessent suggested that existing tariff levels would likely remain in place.“Aside from addressing economic imbalances, tariffs are also now well entrenched in the geo-political arena,” said Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank’s Asia & Oceania Treasury Department.Trump recently unveiled a new trade framework with Japan, proposing a 15 per cent import tax- lower than the previously floated 25 per cent. Under the deal, Japan agreed to invest $550 billion in the US and expand access to its automotive and rice markets, though finer details are still pending.Meanwhile, the US and the EU struck a deal to impose 15 per cent tariffs on cars and other goods, again lower than earlier threats. Despite the announcements, many trade details remain unresolved, keeping investors on edge. US markets ended Monday relatively stable, with investors awaiting the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday. Wall Street broadly expects the Fed to delay any rate cuts until September, although some Trump-appointed officials could dissent. The Fed has held rates steady throughout 2025 following a series of reductions late last year.Technology and AI-linked stocks continued to lead the market. Tesla shares jumped 3 per cent after it announced a potential $16.5 billion semiconductor deal with Samsung Electronics. Samsung's stock in Seoul surged 6.8 per cent.Chipmakers saw broad gains following Alphabet’s announcement of an $85 billion investment in AI chips and related initiatives. Advanced Micro Devices climbed 4.3 per cent, while Super Micro Computer surged 10.2 per cent.However, not all earnings updates impressed. Revvity shares plunged 8.3 per cent despite beating quarterly earnings expectations, as its full-year forecast fell short of analyst estimates. The result weighed on broader sentiment.Investors are watching closely as nearly one-third of S&P 500 companies are due to report quarterly results this week. Strong earnings are seen as critical to justifying recent stock rallies, which have been partly fuelled by tariff relief hopes. Some analysts, however, remain sceptical about elevated valuations without corresponding profit growth.In energy markets, US crude edged up by 1 cent to $66.72 per barrel, while Brent crude added 6 cents to $70.10.On the currency front, the US dollar strengthened slightly to 148.56 Japanese yen from 148.54 yen.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

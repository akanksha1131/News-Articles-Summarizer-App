Budget 2026: What does state-level GST data tell us ahead of FM Sitharaman's speech?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-what-does-state-level-gst-data-tell-us-ahead-of-fm-sitharamans-speech/articleshow/127782883.cms,"By Lalitagauri Kulkarni and Bhushana Karandikar

Growth, Inflation, Jobs Improve, But Risks Loom: What CEA’s Economic Survey Briefing Really Reveals

Revenue pattern across states shaped by differences in economic structure

Shift in India’s Tax Culture

(Lalitagauri Kulkarni is Faculty Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics. Bhushana Karandikar is an Independent Researcher)

The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax GST ) in 2017 was one of India’s most significant tax reforms, aimed at simplifying indirect taxation and creating a common national market. Seven years on, the overall picture is encouraging. The constant effort to rationalise the classification of goods services and the latest reforms, show sincere effort to create a harmonised tax system for a national market. GST revenues have risen steadily, reflecting economic expansion, improved digitization, and the growing maturity of the tax system. Proposed in 2000 by the Dasgupta Committee on indirect tax reforms, GST rested on three objectives: creating a unified indirect tax framework, building a common national market, and improving tax buoyancy so that revenues would rise in step with economic expansion. Has it achieved its objectives? A look into the state-wise data on GST revenue from 2017 to 2024 provides some insights on the cusp of Union Budget 2026.The constant effort to rationalise the classification of goods and services, and the latest reforms, show sincere effort to create a harmonised tax system for a national market. Evidence from nano to large-size enterprises suggests that compliance and digital payments are easier than under the earlier multi-layered indirect tax regime.According to official data, gross GST collections reached a record ₹22.08 lakh crore in 2024–25, a 9.4 per cent increase over the previous year, with average monthly collections of ₹1.84 lakh crore. Headline numbers are encouraging.A central objective of the GST is also to harmonise India’s fragmented tax system so that tax buoyancy improves across the states meaning GST tax revenues would grow in line with, ideally faster than, the State incomes.In India, GST is split between different levels of government. For sales that take place within a state, the tax is shared between the Centre (CGST) and the state government (SGST), replacing earlier state levies such as VAT and entertainment tax. For sales that occur across state borders, as well as imports, the Centre collects Integrated GST (IGST).GST collections have strengthened across the country, although at different paces. Average GST-to-GSDP ratios across states range from about 3 per cent to 13 per cent, a variation that has remained broadly stable over time. Importantly, absolute GST collections have increased in almost all states, including through periods of economic disruption, underscoring the resilience of the GST framework.Economic structure plays an important role in shaping these outcomes. States with higher levels of urbanisation and a larger services base, such as Haryana and Maharashtra, have recorded particularly strong increases in GST collections relative to output. In Haryana, the GST-to-GSDP ratio has risen from around 7.6 to 17.6 per cent, while in Maharashtra it has increased from 5.6 to 13.8 per cent. These gains highlight the effectiveness of GST in capturing value addition in service-oriented, digitally connected economies.Other states have also shown meaningful progress. Odisha, for instance, has seen its GST-to-GSDP ratio rise from about 4.1 to 10.9 per cent over the same period, reflecting improved formalisation and better integration into the GST system.GST has changed how taxes are paid and administered in India. GST, has shifted the system toward more transparent, simpler to understand, and harder to evade. In short, GST represents a cultural shift in taxation, not just a change in tax rates. The earlier system relied heavily on physical paperwork, multiple overlapping taxes, and discretionary enforcement, which created scope for complexity, inefficiency, and rent-seeking. Timely filing of GST returns has improved significantly across states, reflecting stronger procedural compliance and familiarity with the digital system.Going forward, further improvements in GST revenues are likely to come from deepening compliance by supporting registered businesses, strengthening verification, and leveraging digital data more effectively to expand registrations.With the GST compensation mechanism having concluded in 2022, the steady growth in state-level GST collections is a positive sign for fiscal stability. As GST enters a more mature phase, its contribution to public finances will increasingly depend on how well tax administration aligns with underlying economic structures across states.GST cannot be judged in simple binary terms as either a success or a failure, it is an evolving institutional reform. It has improved transparency and stabilised indirect taxation, while it operates within an uneven economic landscape. The next phase of GST is less about changing rates and more about aligning the system with underlying economic structure and state capacity, as state revenue outcomes depend less on tax design and compliance and more on economic fundamentals and administration.","The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax GST in 2017 was one of India’s most significant tax reforms.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmarks, opened in red on Friday. While Nifty50 went below 25,300, BSE Sensex was down over 500 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,274.65, down 144 points or 0.57%. BSE Sensex was at 82,056.49, down 510 points or 0.62%.Analysts expect stock-specific movements to take centre stage as investors position themselves ahead of the Union Budget. Global and domestic market cues point to a cautious, rangebound trading environment.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “As we near the Budget Day there are headwinds and tailwinds for the market. Geopolitical issues continue to plague global trade with continuous threats of tariff weaponisation by Trump. The spike in Brent crude to near $ 70 is a headwind for Indian macros in general and industries that use oil as inputs, in particular. However, these headwinds are likely to be countered by the positive message from the Economic Survey that projects GDP growth of 6.8 to 7.2% growth in FY 27. ”“With 3.5% headline inflation, India is headed for around 10% nominal GDP growth in FY27.This has the potential to deliver 15 to 17% earnings growth in FY 27, imparting resilience to the market. The steady decline in FPI outflows during the last two days indicate a possible change in FPI strategy. Another significant trend is India’s success in diversification of its export market away from the US to other markets. From early 2027 onwards this trend will gain momentum with the India- EU trade deal getting implemented. Overall, at this juncture, tailwinds are stronger than headwinds and this is positive for markets in the medium to long-term.""US equities ended lower on Thursday, as concerns over corporate earnings and uncertainty around heavy investments in artificial intelligence weighed on sentiment. The S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq slipped after investors questioned whether massive AI-related spending by large technology firms would translate into sustainable returns.Early on Friday, futures linked to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 were down about 0.2 per cent. Technology stocks remained in focus after Apple flagged that rising component costs could pressure its margins, despite reporting earnings that beat market expectations. The stock posted marginal gains in extended trade, while Asian markets opened slightly higher.Back home, foreign portfolio investors continued to trim exposure, selling equities worth Rs 394 crore on Thursday, according to provisional data.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

A Regulatory Reset That Must Get the Balance Right

GST Rationalisation

: A Farmer-Centric Correction

Manufacturing Opportunity in a Reordering World

Backing Innovation with Fiscal Intent

(Susheel Kumar is Managing Director, Syngenta India)

Indian agriculture stands at an important inflection point. On the one hand, the country speaks with confidence of becoming a global food powerhouse, a trusted supplier to the world and a hub for agricultural manufacturing. On the other, the policy ecosystem around crop protection, the backbone of yield security, farmer resilience and food price stability, is undergoing a period of active transition. As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, this moment offers an opportunity to bring sharper clarity, confidence and a renewed commitment to science-based decision-making.Over the past year, public discourse on crop protection has been particularly animated. Pesticides are often discussed primarily through the lens of risk, while the role they play in preventing losses, protecting farmer incomes and containing food inflation receives far less attention. This imbalance in the debate comes at a time when Indian farmers continue to lose crops worth more than ₹2 lakh crore annually to pests, diseases and weeds, losses that no country aspiring to food security and export leadership can afford to overlook.The intent around the proposed Pesticides Management Bill, 2025 marks a significant move as it aims to align India’s regulatory framework with contemporary realities. The intent to strengthen oversight, improve compliance and protect farmers and consumers is both timely and necessary. As with all foundational reforms, however, the true impact will depend on how effectively these intentions are translated into practice.For an innovation-driven sector, predictability and proportionality matter as much as stringency. A regulatory system that is risk-based, science-led and time-bound does not weaken safety; it strengthens it by encouraging responsible participation, greater investment in stewardship and quicker adoption of safer, newer technologies. India’s crop protection sector, led by R&D-driven companies that account for nearly 70% of the market and have introduced 95% of the molecules used in the country, invest over USD 6 billion annually in global research and development. Ensuring that this innovation pipeline reaches Indian farmers requires a regulatory approach that consistently recognises evidence alongside precaution.The proposed Pesticides Management Bill can therefore be powerfully complemented by a Budget that supports regulatory capacity, modern testing infrastructure and efficient evaluation timelines. Together, these measures can ensure that the new framework functions as a bridge to safer agriculture rather than an unintended bottleneck.As Budget 2026 draws closer, the crop protection sector is seeking a clearer acknowledgement of a fundamental economic reality: safeguarding yields is as critical as producing them and hence crop protection products play an indispensable role in sustaining productivity. Recognising them as essential agricultural inputs would better reflect their contribution to farm resilience and national food security.One of the most immediate expectations from Budget 2026 is the rationalisation of GST on crop protection products to a maximum of 5%, bringing them in line with other fertilisers (biostimulants/ biologicals). Such a step would ease cost pressures on farmers and reinforce responsible usage by improving access to legitimate, high-quality products.Seen in this light, GST rationalisation is not a concession to industry, but a farmer-centric correction, one that strengthens productivity, safety and compliance across the agricultural value chain.Globally, agrochemical supply chains are undergoing a structural realignment, with companies actively diversifying manufacturing bases and reducing concentration risks. India is well positioned to benefit from this shift, provided policy ambition is matched with enabling fiscal and industrial frameworks.A targeted Production Linked Incentive framework for the manufacture of new crop protection molecules could help attract global-scale investments, deepen domestic manufacturing capabilities and integrate India more firmly into international supply chains. This is not merely about import substitution; it is about positioning India as a reliable and competitive producer for global markets.Crop protection innovation is science-intensive, capital-heavy and inherently long-term. Developing a new molecule can take more than a decade, demanding sustained investment and regulatory certainty. While India has made strides in recognising innovation across sectors, there remains scope to further strengthen fiscal support for agricultural R&D.Allowing a 200% weighted tax deduction on recognised research and development expenditure would reinforce the message that agricultural innovation is central to India’s growth story. Equally important is recognising stewardship as an extension of public policy. Investments made by companies in farmer training, resistance management and safe-use education directly support food safety and environmental outcomes. A 150% tax deduction on stewardship expenditure would align fiscal policy with sustainability objectives already embedded in national priorities.As Budget 2026 is finalised, the choice before policymakers is a constructive one. India can reinforce crop protection as a strategic lever for farmer resilience, export growth and food security, ensuring that fiscal and regulatory frameworks move in step with national ambition. The direction taken will shape not only industry outcomes, but the long-term stability and competitiveness of India’s agricultural economy.","The intent around the proposed Pesticides Management Bill, 2025 marks a significant move as it aims to align India’s regulatory framework with contemporary realities.

Silver and gold extended their glittering rallies on Thursday, hitting record levels on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) as investors flocked to safe-haven assets amid ongoing geopolitcal tensions. For the first time in MCX history, silver jumped past Rs 4 lakh per kg, while gold futures moved within striking distance of Rs 1.8 lakh per 10 grams, reflecting intense risk-off sentiment across global markets.MCX gold contracts expiring on February 5, 2026 rose nearly 6%, gaining Rs 9,954 to trade at Rs 1,75,869 per 10 grams. Silver futures for March 5, 2026 jumped Rs 15,414, or about 5%, to Rs 4,00,780 per kg.The surge comes after the US Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged, alongside indications that further rate hikes are unlikely. Lower expectations of tighter monetary policy typically support non-yielding assets such as gold and silver, ET reported.Geopolitical developments added fresh fuel to the rally. Safe-haven buying intensified after US President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran over stalled nuclear negotiations, stating that “time is running out,” while confirming an expanded US military deployment in the Gulf, including what he described as a “massive armada” moving towards the region.The rally was mirrored in international markets, where precious metals also scaled unprecedented levels. Spot gold jumped nearly 3% to touch an all-time high of $5,591.61 an ounce, extending gains of over 10% this week. Spot silver climbed to $118.061 an ounce, after briefly hitting a fresh lifetime high of $119.34 earlier in the session.Market participants said silver has benefited from strong spillover demand as investors seek relatively cheaper alternatives to gold, while tight supply conditions and momentum-based buying have further accelerated gains.Manoj Kumar Jain, partner at Prithvi Finmart, told ET that volatility in precious metals is likely to remain elevated in the near term, driven by swings in the dollar index, upcoming US jobless claims data and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.He sees international gold holding support in the $5,140–$5,220 range, with resistance near $5,500–$5,650, while silver may find support between $106.60–$110 and face resistance at $118–$123 per ounce.On the domestic exchange, Jain said gold is expected to remain supported above Rs 1,61,600–1,64,000, while silver may hold above Rs 3,64,800–3,74,000. He advises maintaining a buy-on-dips approach in gold above Rs 1,64,400, targeting Rs 1,70,000–1,75,000, and in silver above Rs 3,64,000, with an upside target of Rs 4,00,000–4,10,000.","For the first time in MCX history, silver jumped past Rs 4 lakh per kg.

Mumbai: The rupee ended Thursday at 91.96 to the dollar, down 18 paise from its previous close of 91.78, after slipping to a record low near the 92 level before recovering marginally on dollar sales by public sector banks on behalf of RBI . The dollar index edged up about 0.12% to around 96.27, adding to pressure on the local currency amid strong dollar demand linked to derivative maturities and corporate hedging.Traders said RBI intervention in the foreign exchange market helped cap losses beyond the psychologically important 92 mark. However, the rupee’s weakness spilled over into the govt bond market, where RBI had undertaken measures to infuse liquidity to keep yields down. However, dollar sales by RBI ended up draining some of the liquidity. Expectations of further depreciation also weighed on the interest rate swap market, pushing short-term swap rates higher despite relatively benign domestic macro indicators.According to Jateen Trivedi of LKP Securities, rupee traded flat to weak as markets remained cautious ahead of the Union Budget on Feb 1.

Zero Tariffs, Massive Market: How India-EU Deal Could Push India Past Bangladesh In Textiles

Bhubaneswar: Praising India and the European Union (EU) for signing the trade agreement, World Bank Group president Ajay Banga Thursday said emerging markets like India are extremely crucial to world trade. “I think all trade deals are important. In the last 20 years, global trade quadrupled, but the share of the emerging markets also doubled from 20% to 40%. India is a key component in trade now,” said Banga, who is on a two-day visit to Odisha.He said in the last 20 years, about 100 regional and bilateral deals were signed. “The India-EU trade deal is an example of that. I think lowering both tariff and non-tariff barriers on both sides will benefit both sets of people. And I think that’s a very good idea. You’ve got to do it in a way that takes care of the right phasing so you don’t damage domestic industries on either side.”On India’s development, the World Bank chief said the amount of infrastructure investment that has happened in India in the last 10 years is admirable. “Do you want more infrastructure? Yes, because India is a large country with enormous opportunities in different parts of the country.It will also create jobs.” he added. Banga also said India has demonstrated its ability to sustain exceptional economic growth.‘Think less about tariffs’He added that going ahead, India should “think less” about tariffs and focus more on opportunities, amid concerns over global trade due to geopolitical tensions. Banga said there are five sectors that will provide growth in employment: infrastructure, agriculture, primary healthcare, tourism, and value-added manufacturing.(With agency inputs)","World Bank Group president Ajay Banga said emerging markets like India are extremely crucial to world trade.

"Hybrid, not home: IT cos’ quiet shift back to office",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hybrid-not-home-it-cos-quiet-shift-back-to-office/articleshow/127788182.cms,".

Bengaluru: One size doesn’t fit all in the return-to-office push. Work-from-home, once the defining perk of the pandemic era, is quietly being phased out across India’s IT sector as companies tighten hybrid work norms and make in-office presence the new default.TCS has mandated five days of office attendance and linking compliance to variable pay and career progression. In 2024, TCS rolled out a work-from-office policy that directly links variable pay to attendance compliance. Employees with 85% or higher office attendance are eligible for 100% of the variable pay for the period, subject to organisational decisions. Those with 75–85% compliance receive 75% of the payout, while employees with 60–75% attendance are eligible for 50%. Staff with less than 60% compliance are not eligible for any performance bonus. Other IT majors, while stopping short of a full return, have introduced their own checks and balances to enforce hybrid work.Infosys mandates a minimum of 10 in-office days each month, with 30 days of medical exemption built into the policy. Employees can also avail five non-medical exemption days per quarter.Wipro now requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week, allowing up to 12 exemption days annually for those unable to meet the requirement.Accenture asks employees to come in once a week. In practice, attendance is often shaped by team-level expectations and managerial discretion rather than policy alone.The broader shift signals a move away from one-size-fits-all work models toward more tightly monitored hybrid frameworks. Work-from-home, once used as a key talent attraction tool, is losing relevance in a market marked by slowing revenue growth, margin pressures, and cautious client spending.“HR norms are moving toward role-based and outcome-based hybrid models,” said Phil Fersht, CEO and chief analyst at US-based IT advisory HFS Research. “Early-career staff, client-facing roles, and teams handling sensitive data will see tighter in-office norms, while senior or highly specialised roles will retain greater flexibility. AI and automation are also making work more collaborative and iterative, increasing the value of in-person interaction at certain stages. ”Pareekh Jain, CEO and lead analyst at Pareekh Consulting, said companies are tightening norms because concerns around attrition and talent attraction have eased. “There will still be flexibility for mental and physical health needs, but that will vary by company. Some will mandate two or three days a week, others 10–15 days a month,” he said.","TCS has mandated five days of office attendance and linking compliance to variable pay and career progression.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

New Delhi: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Thursday said India’s macroeconomic fundamentals are stronger than ever and the economy has successfully navigated global headwinds to be on a high-growth trajectory, improving potential GDP growth to 7%.“Amid a global environment in which many emerging markets struggled, India stood out for its effective management of inflation without compromising growth. Our govt’s proactive supply-side management has driven inflation down to historic lows,” she said in a series of social media posts. Inflation has moderated to 1.3% as food prices have fallen, also creating headroom for higher consumption spending amid a cut in income tax and GST last year.The survey noted that consumption has soared, while investment has held steady, helping sustain the growth momentum. The Indian economy is estimated to grow 7.4% this year and the survey has projected 6.8-7.2% growth during the next financial year.Citing numbers from the 687-page document she reasserted govt’s commitment to fiscal consolidation without compromising on growth. Ahead of her ninth consecutive budget to be presented on Sunday, Sitharaman said the fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP “is well on track”, reassuring market players amid a slowdown in tax collections.She also re emphasised the focus on deregulation, which she had flagged in her last budget. “The Economic Survey mentions that a progression from ‘swadeshi’ to ‘strategic resilience’ to ‘strategic indispensability’ will ensure the world moves from ‘thinking about buying Indian’ to ‘buying Indian without thinking’. It is in this context that our govt has been focusing on deregulation and strengthening the manufacturing sector in the country through various measures. ”The finance minister also said that the efforts to strengthen human capital have also helped sustain India’s growth, which can be seen from the gains made in education and health outcomes.“The survey underscores that these investments are converting India’s demographic dividend into a durable development dividend driven by healthier, quality-educated citizens,” she said.The budget comes at a time when the economy is resilient but global challenges have increased, which may prompt govt to unleash deep reform measures.",Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook.

The Maharashtra state government has declared a three day state mourning after the passing away of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The veteran leader of Nationalist Congress Party, died in a plane crash on Wednesday morning in Baramati.Along with Pawar, his personal security officer, an aide, and two crew members comprising the pilot in command and the first officer lost their lives in the incident.Pawar is survived by his wife Sunetra, a Rajya Sabha member, and their two sons, Parth and Jay.Following the tragedy, the Maharashtra government announced a public holiday on Wednesday and declared three days of state mourning.There is no official notification of banks being closed in Maharashtra as part of the mourning declared in the state.

UFBU represents nine unions comprising officers and employees of banks, and close to eight lakh staff members from public sector banks joined the strike action.As a result, cheque clearances amounting to nearly Rs 4 lakh crore were stalled, while cash transactions also suffered.

India-EU FTA: Will Turkish goods enter India under the newly signed trade deal?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-eu-fta-will-turkish-goods-enter-india-under-the-newly-signed-trade-deal/articleshow/127749117.cms,"India-EU FTA Explained: What Gets Cheaper, Who Gains And Why This Deal Matters To Indian Consumers

India and the EU recently announced the conclusion of what has been touted as the “mother of all deals”, but a key question remains: will Turkey be able to reroute its goods to India under the agreement?Officials have clarified that while Indian products can move into Turkiye through Europe, Turkish goods cannot enter India under FTA terms, even if shipped via EU ports. “Our goods go into the EU, and then they can go to any country with which the EU has a customs union, but Turkiye will not get the benefit because it is not part of the EU as a territory in the FTA. So, Turkiye cannot export to India and benefit from concessions,” said one official, who did not wish to be identified.Under the EU–Turkiye Customs Union, Ankara is required to align with the EU’s common external tariff, meaning that when the EU reduces duties for an FTA partner such as India, Turkiye must extend the same tariff benefit to Indian goods.This is because of Turkiye’s position in the union arrangement with the EU, which has been in force since 1996. The arrangement allows industrial goods and processed agricultural products to move freely between the EU and Turkiye without tariffs or quotas, while requiring Turkiye to apply the EU’s common external tariff on imports from third countries. The customs union, however, does not extend to primary agriculture, services, investment, government procurement or digital trade.India and the EU announced the conclusion of negotiations for the FTA on Tuesday, with the agreement expected to be signed and implemented within the year. Under the deal, preferential market access will be provided on 96.8% of tariff lines, covering 99.5% of India’s exports by volume and 90.7% by value to the EU, which will become duty-free.Officials explained that although Turkiye must mirror EU tariff reductions for FTA partners such as India, it does not gain reciprocal access because it is not a signatory to the India-EU agreement. “Turkish goods, however, cannot use the India-EU FTA to enter India duty-free, even if they are shipped via EU ports. They remain Turkish in origin and therefore do not meet the rules of origin under India's FTA, which is signed with the EU and not with Turkiye,” said Ajay Srivastava, cofounder, Global Trade Research Initiative, as cited by ET.The clarification comes amid strained relations between New Delhi and Ankara following Turkiye’s backing of Islamabad and its condemnation of India’s strikes on terror camps in Pakistan in May under Operation Sindoor.Trade figures show that India’s exports to Turkiye declined by 14.1% to $5.71 billion in 2024–25 from $6.65 billion in the previous financial year, while imports from Turkiye fell 20.8% to around $3 billion. Turkiye accounts for about 1.3% of India’s total exports of $437 billion in 2023–24.India’s exports to Turkiye include mineral fuels and oil, electrical machinery and equipment, automobiles and parts, organic chemicals, pharmaceutical products, tanning and dyeing items, plastics and rubber, cotton, man-made fibres and filaments, and iron and steel. Imports from Turkiye comprise marble blocks and slabs, fresh apples, gold, vegetables, lime and cement, mineral oil, chemicals, natural or cultured pearls, and iron and steel.","India and the EU announced the conclusion of negotiations for the FTA on Tuesday.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell To Face Jail? Trump DOJ In Action | Karoline's Shock Update Amid Big Clash

US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he will announce his nominee for the next Federal Reserve chair next week. The new chair will replace Jerome Powell, whose term ends later this year.Trump shared the timeline during a Cabinet meeting with his secretaries. “It’ll be a person that will do, I think, do a good job,” Trump said. “We’re paying far too much interest in the Fed. The Fed rate is too high, unacceptably high.”Trump has said he is considering four people for the role. They are Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council; Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board; former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh; and Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock.Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly criticised Powell.

Toyota car sales climb despite US trade tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/toyota-car-sales-climb-despite-us-trade-tensions/articleshow/127767517.cms,"Japanese auto giant Toyota said on Thursday that global sales hit a new record last year, despite trade tensions, as it retained its title as the world's top automaker and widened the gap with German rival Volkswagen.Sales, including those of subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors, rose 4.6 percent to 11.3 million vehicles, the company said.That far outstripped Volkswagen's total of 8.98 million vehicles, which was down 0.5 percent from the year before.The overall increase came despite flat sales for Toyota in China, a crucial market where it faces intensifying competition from local automakers including electric-car champion BYD.US sales climbed eight percent in spite of the 25 percent tariff on Japanese auto exports imposed by Washington between April and mid-September, when a 15 percent cap kicked in.The United States is a key market where Toyota generates almost a quarter of its sales. But of the 2.52 million vehicles it sold there in 2025, only 1.39 million were produced in the country.Even so, it last year increased output by 10 percent at its factories in the United States, where it produces its increasingly popular hybrid vehicles.To keep exporting to the United States on competitive terms, Japanese automakers have had to slash prices.In early November, Toyota estimated the impact of US duties on its annual operating profit at around 1.45 trillion yen ($9.5 billion).Other Japanese automakers, meanwhile, are taking a hit.Nissan, which is in serious financial difficulty, saw sales drop 4.4 percent to 3.2 million vehicles in 2025, with a 6.3 percent collapse in its flagship Chinese market.Honda reported an almost nine percent plunge in global sales, to 3.4 million vehicles.","Sales, including those of subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors, rose 4.6 percent to 11.3 million vehicles.

It was the second year in a row of steep declines. The drop came despite the introduction of cheaper models and Musk's promise to remain laser-focused on the company after a foray into US politics.Still, Tesla investors have kept the faith in Musk. The stock is up 9 per cent in the past year.Musk has been urging investors to focus less on car sales and more on what he considers a bright new artificial intelligence future of robotaxis ferrying millions in cars without drivers, or even steering wheels, and robots watering plants and taking care of elderly parents.On a conference call, Musk underlined that shift by announcing Tesla had decided to close down production of two older car models, S and X, in the second quarter and convert a Fremont, California, factory to produce its Optimus robots instead.Making those future ambitions a reality will take money. Officials said Tesla would spend big on AI and others new projects this year, more than doubling capital expenditures to USD 20 billion.And the company revealed it had recently invested USD 2 billion in the artificial intelligence company xAI, raising potential conflicts of interest issues as Musk holds big stakes in both companies.That AI business, known for its Grok AI assistant, has courted controversy for echoing Musk's views on race, gender, and politics and, recently, producing nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images.Tesla's fourth quarter profit also fell sharply, dropping 61 per cent to USD 840 million, or 24 cents. But excluding one-time charges, net income totalled 50 cents per share, compared to analysts' forecasts of 45 cents.""They've got aging product that is less and less competitive as other manufacturers come out with new models, then there is the general brand destruction,"" said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid. ""Musks involvement in politics has turned off customers.""There were hopeful signs in the report, too. Tesla's energy storage business, though small compared to the car sales, posted strong numbers last quarter with revenues surging 25 per cent to USD 3.8 billion reflecting demand from new datacentres sucking up energy around the US.Tesla's gross profit margins were another bright spot, leaping to 20 per cent last quarter from 16 per cent a year ago.""Tesla's ability to show improving profitably was a surprise,"" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.Goldstein said he was also encouraged by plans outlined in Tesla's earnings report to roll out robotaxi service in Houston, Miami and five other cities in the first half of this year. In the conference call, the company also said that it would begin producing its two-seated Cybercab with no wheels or pedals in the same time frame.But Musk is well know for making promises with deadlines he never meets.Musk said that European regulators would approve its partial self-driving software in the first three months last year, a potential big boost to Tesla sales there. But that hasn't happen yet. And a strong revival in sales Musk heralded midway through the year also failed to materialise.The robotaxi program has progressed slowly, which Musk told investors is due to Tesla being extremely cautious to avoid mishaps.Tesla promised robotaxi rides without anyone driving the car, but until recently the cars had supervisors inside to grab the controls in case something went wrong. Tesla has now removed the safety drivers in Austin where it launched the service in June.For some on Wall Street that is enough to keep pushing the stock up.One of Wall Street's most bullish analysts, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, expects robotaxis will be in more than 30 cities by the end of this year, and that Tesla will capture 70 per cent of the global market for self-driving cars in a decade.Ives and others are also encouraged that Musk has shifted his focus back to the company after spending months as head of a government cost-cutting team in Washington.But it's not clear his attention will remain as undivided in the new year. He has plans to take his rocket company SpaceX public, possibly in June, in what many expect to be a blockbuster IPO that make him the world's first trillionaire - but also possibly distract him.",Tesla's annual profit plunged to its lowest level since the pandemic five years ago.

Tether is shaking up gold market with massive metal hoard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tether-is-shaking-up-gold-market-with-massive-metal-hoard/articleshow/127749392.cms,".

There are roughly 370,000 nuclear bunkers in Switzerland, a legacy of the Cold War that are now rarely used. One of them, though, is a hive of activity.Every week, more than a ton of gold is hauled in to the high-security vault, owned by crypto giant Tether Holdings SA, which is now the world’s largest known hoard of bullion outside of banks and nation states. Over the past year, Tether has quietly become one of the biggest players in the global gold market — the embodiment of a meeting of the crypto and gold worlds whose shared distrust of govt debt is a major factor behind the surge in prices to never-before-seen highs above $5,200 an ounce.And yet relatively little is known about its inner workings, or its gold strategy. When two of the most senior gold traders quit leading bullion bank HSBC Holdings last year, the industry was abuzz with gossip about where they would head next; few guessed that the answer was Tether.In an interview with Bloomberg, chief executive Paolo Ardoino described the company’s role in the gold market as similar to that of a central bank, and predicted that Washington’s geopolitical rivals would launch a gold-backed alternative to the dollar.He revealed that it plans to keep ploughing its enormous profits into gold, while also beginning to compete with banks in trading the metal.“We are soon becoming basically one of the biggest, let’s say, gold central banks in the world,” he said.Even in these historic times for the gold market, Tether’s activities stand out. It has rapidly stepped up its purchases, buying over 70 tonnes of gold over the course of last year for its reserves and its own gold stablecoin, according to a Bloomberg calculation. That’s more than was reported by almost any single central bank: only Poland, which added 102 tonnes to its reserves, made larger declared purchases. It is also more than what was bought by any but the three largest exchange-traded funds, which represent the collective activity of tens of thousands of individual traders and investors.Tether holds around 140 tonnes of gold, according to Ardoino, most of which are its own reserves, along with the bullion backing its own gold token. That amount of metal is worth $24 billion, the largest known hoard outside of those held by central banks, ETFs and commercial banks whose vaults underpin the main trading hubs. Ardoino said Tether had been buying at a rate of about one to two tonnes a week, and intended to continue doing so for “definitely the next few months. ”Tether makes money from its dollar stablecoin that is the giant of the sector, with $186 billion in circulation. The company takes in real dollars in exchange for that USDT token, and invests them in Treasuries and other assets, such as gold, raking in billions in interest and trading profits.Possessing the physical metal is crucial, Ardoino said, so much so that the company has taken the unusual step of storing the bullion itself in the former nuclear bunker in Switzerland, guarded by multiple layers of thick steel doors. “It’s a James Bond kind of place,” Ardoino said.The secretive nature of the gold market means that while it’s easy to describe broad drivers of investment, it can be hard to pinpoint who exactly is buying.

The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged, holding its benchmark lending rate at 3.5% to 3.75%.The decision was not unanimous. Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran dissented, favouring a quarter-point rate cut.The decision comes after the central bank cut rates at three consecutive meetings late last year. Fed officials have said they want time to see how those cuts affect the economy before considering any further reduction, signalling that rates could stay on hold for the next few months.The pause was widely expected. While concerns over a slowing labour market had earlier pushed the Fed to cut rates, recent economic data has been more mixed. Growth has been stronger than expected, unemployment remains low, and inflation continues to stay above the central bank’s comfort level.The Fed’s cautious approach comes amid renewed political pressure. President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued that interest rates should be cut more aggressively. Since returning to office last year, he has stepped up criticism of the central bank, drawing warnings from officials about the need to protect its independence.Trump has called for the removal of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, and his administration has launched an inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over renovations at the central bank’s headquarters.Earlier this month, Powell responded strongly to the criticism, warning against threats of criminal prosecution and raising concerns about whether monetary policy decisions could be influenced by political pressure.","US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, holding its benchmark lending rate at 3.5% to 3.75%.

US Dollar’s ‘Worst Day’ As Trump DUMPS Concerns Over Currency Decline | ‘Can Control It Like Yo-Yo’

What are ' Trump accounts '?

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday launched a new federal investment programme for newborns, with the White House saying over 500,000 families have already enrolled. The initiative aims to help children build long-term savings and address affordability concerns for American families.The investment accounts, named after Trump are being set up for babies born over a three-year period and include an initial government contribution. The move comes as the Trump administration and the Republican Party seek to address rising affordability concerns ahead of the November midterm elections, according to Reuters.The accounts were created last year under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the administration’s flagship tax and spending legislation.Under the scheme, the US Treasury will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts for all children born between 2025 and 2028. Officials estimate that around 25 million families will be eligible for the benefit.The government is also encouraging families to make additional contributions to the accounts. Some private investors have already stepped in, including entrepreneur Michael Dell and his wife Susan, who have committed a combined $6.25 billion to the programme.Speaking at a White House event in Washington to launch the accounts, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the initiative was designed to address gaps in savings among American families.She said if families contribute the maximum $5,000 each year, the account will accumulate almost $1.1 million by the time the newborn turns 28.The Trump administration is also promoting the programme as a bipartisan effort rather than a partisan policy.“It’s not about red or blue politics,” Cheryl Hines, an actress and the wife of Health Secretary Robert Kennedy, said at the event.Despite the rollout, public awareness of the programme remains limited. A poll by Exclusive Public First found that 57 per cent of Americans had never heard of a Trump account, while another 25 per cent said they were aware of it but could not explain how it worked, Politico reported. Only 14 per cent of respondents said they had heard of the accounts and could explain them.Trump accounts are federally supported investment accounts designed to help US children build savings from birth through long-term investing.Under the scheme, each eligible child receives a one-time government deposit of $1,000 into an account opened in their name, with parents or guardians acting as custodians until the child turns 18, according to ET.Money in the accounts is required to be invested in low-cost index funds largely tracking US companies. The funds remain locked in until adulthood, after which the account converts into an individual retirement account (IRA).Families, employers and other contributors can add up to $5,000 annually, while employer contributions of up to $2,500 are exempt from being treated as taxable income. Withdrawals are governed by standard IRA rules, with limited allowances for specific purposes such as education, buying a first home or starting a business.The administration said that the initiative brings together government support, private participation and household savings to strengthen long-term financial security for future generations.","Trump accounts are federally supported investment accounts designed to help US children build savings from birth through long-term investing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 114 points, or 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent in early trade, AP reported.The pace of the S&P 500’s climb has accelerated sharply in recent years. It took nearly three years for the index to rise from 4,000 to 5,000, but only about nine months to move from 5,000 to 6,000, a level reached in November 2024. The swift push past 7,000 reflects mounting confidence in US corporate earnings and the economy’s ability to withstand tighter financial conditions.Gains on Wednesday were led by heavyweight technology stocks after Dutch chip equipment maker ASML issued a 2026 revenue forecast that exceeded market expectations, reinforcing confidence in sustained demand linked to artificial intelligence.ASML’s customers have become more optimistic about the medium-term outlook, driven largely by expectations for the “sustainability” of AI-related demand, chief executive Christophe Fouquet said, helping ease concerns that the AI rally could be approaching bubble territory.Nvidia, widely seen as the bellwether of the AI boom, rose 1.2 per cent, making it the single biggest contributor to the S&P 500’s advance. ASML’s US-listed shares were little changed.Elsewhere, stock moves were mixed following fresh earnings updates. Starbucks jumped 4.9 per cent after quarterly revenue beat expectations, aided in part by strong demand for a viral promotional cup, even though profits for the end of 2025 missed estimates.In contrast, Amphenol slid 14.9 per cent despite reporting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue growth, as elevated expectations weighed on the stock after a sharp rally earlier this year.Analysts said companies remain under pressure to deliver robust earnings growth following the market’s record-setting run, with stock prices increasingly vulnerable to any disappointment.In currency markets, the US dollar stabilised, rising about 0.3 per cent against the British pound and Japanese yen, a day after a broader dollar index fell to its weakest level since early 2022.The dollar has generally weakened since President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year, with losses accelerating after renewed tariff threats against parts of Europe earlier this month. Those risks, combined with concerns over US government debt, have periodically prompted global investors to reduce exposure to US assets — a trend often referred to as “Sell America.”In the bond market, Treasury yields were steady ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later in the day. The 10-year yield held at 4.24 per cent. The Fed is widely expected to keep rates unchanged, balancing persistent inflation against growth risks.Commodities remained firm as investors sought safe havens. Gold added another 3.5 per cent to $5,258.50 an ounce, after crossing the $5,000 mark for the first time earlier this week.Overseas markets were mixed. European indices slipped, while Asian stocks posted strong gains.

Khosla raids Elon’s ghosla: Calls on tech workers to quit Musk's Tesla and SpaceX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/khosla-raids-elons-ghosla-nest-calls-on-tech-workers-to-quit-musks-tesla-and-spacex/articleshow/127639073.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Elon Musk On EU Radar; X’s AI Chatbot Grok Faces Biggest Probe Over Sexual Deepfakes | Details

Among Silicon Valley elites where tech titans have largely aligned with President Donald Trump’s purportedly race-driven MAGA vision, Indian-American venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has been an outlier. Exceptional as his opposition to Trump has been, the billionaire tech savant has set off a political and cultural firestorm this week with a blunt message aimed at MAGA maverick Elon Musk ’s workforce: if you are a non-white employee at Tesla, SpaceX or X, you should quit — and come work for him instead.In a viral post on X, Khosla accused Musk of advancing a racially exclusionary version of Trump’s MAGA movement and urged employees who disagreed to walk away. “@elonmusk doesn’t want MAGA, he wants WAGA — ‘white America great again’ — as a ‘racism is great and desirable’ paradigm,” Khosla wrote, responding to Musk’s comments about white people becoming a “rapidly diminishing minority.” Khosla went on to invite “all non-whites… and all decent whites” at Musk’s companies to resign and send their LinkedIn profiles to Khosla Ventures.The extraordinary call — part political denunciation, part talent raid — crystallized Khosla’s position as one of the very few tech titans willing to openly challenge Trump’s growing alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite.While much of the industry – including companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, all led by Indian-Americans – has moved to accommodate, or even embrace, Trump II, Khosla has chosen defiance, framing the moment as a moral test for American capitalism.Musk responded by calling Khosla a “pompous a******” and reminding him that his partner, Shivon, is half Indian and his eldest son with her “is named in honor of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.”The Musk clash did not emerge in isolation. For months, Khosla has used his social media presence to attack Trump’s leadership, values and approach to governance. In January 2026, he described the administration’s agenda as “The Undoing Project,” accusing Trump of orchestrating a “rampant, multifarious attack on American values, norms, institutions, laws, and democracy.” He has warned that fear and cynicism are being used to silence opposition and has repeatedly urged Republicans, executives and investors to speak out.Khosla’s hostility toward Trump is deeply personal as well as political. An immigrant from India and a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, he has argued that Trump’s rhetoric and policies undermine the meritocratic ideals that powered Silicon Valley’s rise. In earlier posts that resurfaced during the 2024 election cycle, Khosla said he despised Trump for his “lack of values, his pathological lying, his selfishness,” accusing him of appealing to “the least appealing parts of American society. ”That worldview now puts Khosla sharply at odds with the prevailing direction of the tech industry. A growing cohort of influential “tech bros” has signed up, explicitly or implicitly, for MAGA. Musk stands at the center of that universe, having donated heavily to Trump’s campaign and emerged as the president’s most powerful ally in Silicon Valley. Others in Trump’s orbit include PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, investor and podcaster David Sacks, and venture capital heavyweights Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, all of whom have praised Trump’s promises of deregulation, tax cuts and a lighter regulatory touch on artificial intelligence and crypto.Even executives who once positioned themselves as Trump skeptics have largely shifted to pragmatic cooperation. Leaders of Meta (Mark Zuckerberg), Amazon (Jeff Bezos), Apple (Tim Cook), Google (Sundar Pichai), Microsoft (Satya Nadella), and IBM (Arvind Krishna) have attended Trump events, increased political donations and pledged billions in US investments, while tech lobbying has surged to record levels. The calculation is straightforward: access, influence and regulatory relief outweigh ideological discomfort.By contrast, open opposition has become rare. Aside from Khosla, only a handful of prominent figures — including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and entrepreneur Mark Cuban — have maintained public distance from Trump. While dozens of top venture capitalists now lean pro-Trump, outspoken critics can be counted on one hand.The divide carries consequences for tech workers, many of whom remain politically liberal even as their employers drift right. Over 450 employees from Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and OpenAI recently signed an open letter demanding their CEOs ""pick up the phone"" to stop ICE excesses. Khosla’s call for non-white employees to leave Musk’s companies is tapping into that tension, highlighting a widening gap between executive power and workforce values. As Trump settles deeper into his second term, Silicon Valley increasingly looks like a sector that has chosen alignment over resistance. Khosla, by contrast, is betting that dissent still matters — even if it leaves him standing nearly alone.",Vinod Khosla is one of the few tech titans willing to openly challenge Trump's growing alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite. The billionaire tech savant has set off a political and cultural firestorm this week with a blunt message aimed at MAGA maverick Elon Musk ’s workforce.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127639273,imgsize-610365,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

US stock markets opened on a mixed note on Tuesday as strong earnings from major companies lifted technology shares. However, a sharp sell-off in health insurance stocks pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower amid concerns over future Medicare payments.At 9:30 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.69 points or 0.62 per cent, to 49,106.71.

Technology and auto stocks found support, while healthcare shares declined sharply after the Trump administration proposed a Medicare Advantage payment increase of less than 1 per cent for 2027.Health insurers came under heavy pressure, dragging the Dow lower. UnitedHealth Group and Humana lost nearly 16 per cent of their value before the opening bell, while Elevance Health fell 7.9 per cent and CVS Health dropped 13 per cent, according to AP.Investors were disappointed by the lower-than-expected rate increase, which threatens profit margins in Medicare Advantage plans that cover Americans aged 65 and above.UnitedHealth, the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the US, reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue close to estimates but warned that its revenue could decline in 2026. The stock is down more than 40 per cent since April, reflecting mounting concerns over funding cuts and rising healthcare costs.In contrast, shares of General Motors jumped nearly 5 per cent after the automaker beat quarterly profit estimates and announced a share buyback programme. GM also said it expects to reduce losses from electric vehicle production in 2026 as it scales back output.American Airlines rose about 4 per cent after issuing strong guidance for 2026, despite missing fourth-quarter profit targets. The airline said it lost $325 million in revenue due to the recent government shutdown.Investors are also watching earnings from several mega-cap companies due later this week, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday, followed by Apple on Thursday.Attention remains on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it announces its policy decision on Wednesday. While the Fed has been cutting rates to support growth and employment, inflation remains above its 2 per cent target, limiting room for aggressive easing.Global markets were mixed. In Europe, Germany’s DAX was flat, France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 per cent and Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5 per cent. Asian markets ended mostly higher, led by South Korea’s Kospi, which surged 2.7 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.9 per cent.In commodities, gold prices were steady at around $5,084 an ounce after hitting a record above $5,100 on Monday, as investors sought safe-haven assets amid global trade tensions and inflation concerns.Silver fell nearly 4 per cent.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

"Find less costly ways to address pension concerns instead of OPS, says Raghuram Rajan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/find-less-costly-ways-to-address-pension-concerns-instead-of-ops-says-raghuram-rajan/articleshow/98457871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme and suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.Rajan further said the old pension scheme does involve massive future outlays because of the indexation of pensions to current salaries.""This is an enormous obligation, not necessarily in the short run, but in the long run,"" he said, adding obviously, state governments have to think through the long-term implications for government finances, and whether civil servants are the most in need of help among the constituencies they deal with.Rajan, currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said as he understands it, it may be infeasible technically or legally to move back to the old pension scheme.""If so, there may be less costly ways of addressing the concerns that prompt such moves,"" Rajan told PTI in an email interview.In a major move, a select group of central government employees have been given a one-time option to opt for old pension scheme.The employees who joined the central government services against posts advertised or notified before December 22, 2003, the day National Pension System ( NPS ) was notified, are eligible to join the old pension scheme under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021).Under Old Pension Scheme (OPS), employees get a defined pension. An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme. He suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.

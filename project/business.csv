Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should look to increase the income tax threshold for the 30% tax bracket in her Union Budget 2025, says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.According to BankBazaar, three important income tax changes that need to be brought in Budget 2025 are; raising the 30% income tax threshold to Rs 18 lakh, restructuring tax brackets, and implementing a standardised 30% deduction on gross income.""The 30% tax slab has remained at ₹15 lakh since 2020, despite a 21% rise in the Cost Inflation Index,"" Shetty notes. ""We propose increasing this threshold to ₹18 lakh to reflect inflation and offer relief to urban salaried individuals burdened by rising costs."" This modification would help distribute the tax responsibility more equitably amongst higher-income earners.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Make NPS more attractive - here's how Shetty expresses concerns about solely increasing the tax-free income limit. ""Calls to raise tax-free income to ₹10 lakh are well-intentioned but shift the tax burden to higher earners.

A balanced approach is necessary.""Regarding diminishing long-term savings and insurance adoption, Shetty observes, ""The absence of deductions in the new tax regime has led to reduced interest in essential financial protections.

The incentive to save and to insure—tax deductions—must continue.""Shetty advocates for a 30% flat deduction on gross income with a ₹15 lakh ceiling on deductions.

Union Budget 2025: Travel and Tourism Industry Experts Share Key Expectations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2025-travel-and-tourism-industry-experts-share-key-expectations/articleshow/117516194.cms,"With the Union Budget 2025 approaching, the anticipation among different sectors is palpable. Growth, innovation, and resilience are the broader expectations from the upcoming budget 2025. If we go to a specific industry, then the travel and tourism sector is looking forward to infrastructural development, better connectivity on both regional and international levels, and reduced taxes are some of the major points. Addressing the evolving needs of the sector industry leaders and experts have shared their pre-budget expectations.In this ever-evolving world, Umesh Chowdhary, VC & MD, Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd. is expecting modernization from the budget 2025. He shares, “We hope the upcoming Union Budget 2025 will continue its focus on the modernization of rolling stock, urban mobility, and infrastructure enhancements. India's metro systems, now among the largest globally, have significantly transformed urban life and mobility. Equally crucial is the continued development of safety, infra, and rolling stock to improve trade connectivity and drive economic growth. We anticipate a strong commitment to the ""Make in India"" initiative and reflective policies within the sector, strengthening domestic manufacturing and boosting exports. We hope that the budget would provide a clear roadmap for India’s transportation future, positioning the nation as a global leader in seamless mobility.”Echoing the same sentiment, Dr. Raghupati Singhania, Chairman & Managing Director, JK Tyre & Industries Ltd says, “FY 2025-26 is likely to play a pivotal role in realizing India’s aspirations. With young India becoming highly mobile, entrepreneurial, and increasingly tech-savvy, the upcoming Union Budget is expected to address their needs by fostering supportive policies and a conducive business environment. Over the last decade, India has demonstrated remarkable progress in physical infrastructure and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), and this momentum is bound to accelerate with a focus on last-mile connectivity and infrastructure development in tier-II and III cities as well beyond. A budget emphasizing infrastructure, sustainable mobility, and industrial competitiveness will not only propel the automotive and allied sectors but also significantly contribute to India’s growth story.""On the other hand, Akash Agarwal, Owner, of Rajasthali Resort & Spa is looking forward to some recognition for the sector amid the developing marketplace of India. He shares, “As we anticipate the Union Budget 2025, it is important to emphasize the significant impact of the travel and tourism sector on India's economy, which currently sustains over 40 million jobs and is expected to exceed 62 million in the next ten years. Our expectations for the budget are high, particularly regarding the recognition of the hospitality sector as an industry, which would improve access to financial resources and support. Moreover, permitting GST credits for hotel construction and investing in a strong international campaign under the Incredible India initiative are critical steps. Additionally, revising the tax on rental income will support the growing homestay sector. It is also vital to tackle the GST issues faced by Online Travel Agents and ensure consistent GST rates for online bookings, creating a more equitable and competitive landscape in the tourism industry.”Further, affordable airfare is at the top of the list for Radhika Khanijo, Founder & Private Travel Designer at Welgrow Travel. He says, “There is undoubtedly going to be a surge in international travel. The number of cross-border trips worldwide is expected to rise gradually until 2025. Travel preferences are evolving, with clients increasingly seeking offbeat destinations. Travelers are adding lesser-known spots to their itineraries, looking for unique experiences beyond traditional travel. Additionally, remote working trends are enabling longer stays, allowing travelers to immerse themselves more deeply in destinations.In Budget 2025, we anticipate airlines to restrict significant increases in airfares. As an outbound travel curator, we hope our authorities will address taxation policies, such as reducing GST and waiving off TCS. These measures would allow us to compete on the same platform as international suppliers and foster the competitive nature of our business.Furthermore, investing in sports facilities can position India as a hub for international sporting events, significantly boosting outbound sports tourism.”Last but not least, in inputs provided by Vishal Vincent Tony, Managing Director of Ayatana Hospitality, he mentions, “As 2025 approaches, resorts are looking forward to a budget that supports tourism and helps the hospitality industry thrive. Many hope for lower taxes on stays, which would make luxury getaways more affordable for travellers. Better roads and connectivity to remote destinations are also high on the wish list, making it easier for guests to discover hidden gems.”“Sustainability is becoming a big focus for resorts, so tax breaks or incentives for going green, like using solar power or eco-friendly materials, would be a welcome boost. Training programs for hospitality staff would also help resorts deliver even better guest experiences. Resort Brands are looking for more government backing to upgrade their facilities and enhance their offerings. If the budget focuses on making travel easier, greener, and more affordable, 2025 could be an exciting year for the hospitality world,” he concludes.","With the Union Budget 2025 approaching, the anticipation among different sectors is palpable.

Insurance and taxation



Government pension schemes and MSMEs



Healthcare fund allocation



As the finance ministry gears up for upcoming Union budget 2025, speculations are under way for announcements that could strengthen India’s financial growth, reforming insurance sector, taxation system and healthcare landscape.A recent report by the State Bank of India (SBI) suggested that the government should consider increasing the budget allocated for healthcare by 5 per cent of GDP, along with exemption on GST and taxes on term and health insurance premiums. It also called for rationalising GST rates on medical devices by a uniform 5 per cent to 12 per cent.It further emphasised the need for a major transition in India's insurance and healthcare industry with tax exemptions, increased public spending, and policy rationalisation, to boost these critical areas.The report proposed, “No GST/Tax on Term/Pure Life Insurance and health insurance premiums. In line with NPS, a separate deduction for life/health insurance in the new/old tax regime, say Rs 25,000/50,000. All the government-sponsored pension schemes, APY, PM-SYM, PM-KMY, and NPS-Traders may be brought under one umbrella.”With insurance penetration dipping to 3.7 per cent in FY24 against 4 per cent in FY23 and 4.2 per cent in FY22, the report reminds the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India's (IRDAI) mission of “Insurance for All by 2047.”Life insurance penetration has dropped sharply to 2.8 per cent, while non-life insurance remains stagnant at 1 per cent.The government should encourage more individuals to invest in these essential covers by exempting GST and taxes on term and health insurance premiums. Moreover, it should include a separate tax deduction for life and health insurance premiums, falling under both, the old and new tax regimes, from the range of Rs 25,000- Rs 50,000 to further push the policy adoption.The report also calls for the integration of government-backed pension schemes, such as the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) and Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM), under a unified framework to improve accessibility and effectiveness.It recommends special insurance schemes for MSME employees and their promoters to safeguard families and businesses against unforeseen losses.In healthcare, the report advocates raising the public healthcare budget to 5 per cent of GDP, exceeding the 2.5 per cent target set by the National Health Policy 2017. It suggests funding this increase through a proposed 35 per cent GST on tobacco and sugary products and proceeds from the healthcare CESS.Additionally, rationalising GST rates on medical devices to a uniform 5 per cent - 12 per cent from the current 5 per cent-18 per cent range could reduce costs and simplify compliance, easing the burden on manufacturers and distributors.These measures, according to the report, are crucial for addressing India's growing healthcare needs and nurturing social security. With strategic reforms, India can strengthen its insurance and healthcare infrastructure, promoting economic stability and improved well-being for its citizens.",A recent report by the State Bank of India suggested that the government should consider increasing the budget allocated for healthcare by 5 per cent of GDP.

Budget 2025: Travel and tourism industry experts share their key expectations for growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2025-travel-and-tourism-industry-experts-share-their-key-expectations-for-growth/articleshow/117561090.cms,"As Union Budget 2025 approaches, it has sparked waves of anticipation across the travel and tourism sector. Industry experts' pre-budget wishlists are also ready. While some expect better infrastructure, others express the desire for employment stability. In addition, many are expecting sustainable tourism practices and technological advancements.Mallika Sheth, Co-Founder, of TealFeel, sharing the pre-budget wishlist quoted, “Everyone is talking about an expectation of the government to emphasize quality and innovation in manufacturing to be a better alternative to China. The same focus can be extended to small travel businesses across semi-urban and rural places. By encouraging the development of small businesses in these areas, the government is creating employment stability in a segment of society with income volatility. By giving tax holidays to small businesses and hotels to come up in smaller places, the government will encourage the resurrection of heritage routes and structures and shine a spotlight on parts of our country that didn’t see tourism before. With a parallel investment in infrastructure, development of airports, and road networks, the government will ensure a long-term tourism vision for the country.”Further, stressing the need for better and improved infrastructure, Aditya Chamaria, Managing Director, Damodar Ropeway Infra Limited, stated, “Specifically, there are expectations for solid policies aimed at improving and expanding ropeway infrastructure. This would not only attract tourists but also enhance connectivity in difficult terrains and contribute to local employment generation.To promote ropeway projects, the government is expected to provide tax exemptions, easy loan schemes, and encouragement for public-private partnerships (PPP model). Special funding is needed to expand the ropeway network in tourism hotspots like the Himalayan region, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and the Northeast.”Speaking on similar lines, Ramalingam S, President of Cox & Kings said, “As we look forward to the Union Budget 2025, the tourism sector is set for remarkable growth, thanks to infrastructure improvements that will make India more connected and accessible. The government's commitment to modernizing railways and enhancing regional connectivity is crucial for boosting both domestic and international travel.”He added, “At Cox & Kings, we are particularly optimistic about budget initiatives that emphasize sustainable tourism practices, encourage domestic travel, and utilize technology to improve the overall experience for travelers. Additionally, with the increase in global wealth, India has a unique chance to position itself as a luxury travel destination, appealing to high-net-worth individuals in search of distinctive, curated experiences.”He concluded his wishlist by saying, “We also expect policies that will further integrate India into the global tourism landscape, making it a more appealing destination for international visitors while preserving its rich cultural heritage. Ultimately, the upcoming budget has the potential to create a lasting impact and unlock the true potential of India's tourism industry.”Last but not least, a balanced TCS structure is something that tops the wishlist of Varun Sarda, CEO, of Velocity Travel. He said, “We are hopeful that the upcoming budget will introduce essential reforms to bolster India’s travel sector. The existing TCS on international travel puts Indian agencies at a disadvantage, driving customers to foreign platforms and leading to capital outflow. A more balanced TCS structure would create a fairer environment and ease compliance.”“Furthermore, India needs to enhance inbound tourism by dedicating more resources to global marketing, streamlining visa processes, and investing in infrastructure. Finally, promoting digital transformation through tax incentives for travel technology adoption and simplifying outbound remittance processes will strengthen the industry's competitiveness. For India to establish itself as a global travel hub, equitable taxation and increased investments in tourism are crucial,” he concluded.","As Union Budget 2025 approaches, it has sparked waves of anticipation across the travel and tourism sector. Industry experts' pre-budget wishlists are also ready. While some expect better infrastructure, others express the desire for employment stability. Many are expecting sustainable tourism practices and technological advancements.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117561143,imgsize-29434,width-400,resizemode-4/117561143.jpg"

Budget 2025: Experts urge government to enhance travel and tourism growth in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2025-experts-urge-government-to-enhance-travel-and-tourism-growth-in-india/articleshow/117559608.cms,"The travel and tourism sector is vital in India's culturally rich and diverse landscape. Its contribution cannot be described in words alone. Thus, as the Union Budget 2025 is all set to be announced, industry leaders and experts share their expectations.Rajesh Magow , Co-founder and group CEO of MakeMyTrip highlighted the role of travel and tourism in the economy before sharing his pre-budget wishlist. “It is a vital pillar of India’s economy, contributing over 9% to employment and supporting 40 million jobs—a figure set to exceed 62 million in the next decade. The sector’s role in driving economic inclusivity, empowering communities, and boosting the economy at the grassroots level makes it indispensable to the next chapter of India’s growth story.”“The sector is outpacing the overall economy, with domestic tourism growing at a double-digit rate, driven by rising incomes, a burgeoning middle class, and a preference for travel experiences. Government investments in roads, airports, and railways have been game-changers, enabling faster travel and unlocking new destinations. Long weekends are now synonymous with travel – a testament to the sector’s growing momentum,” he added.Further, sharing about the expectations, he mentioned, “We urge the government to bolster this growth with targeted measures ahead of the Union Budget. This includes granting the long-requested industry status, and further encouraging investment and development in the hospitality sector. Additionally, allowing GST credit for hotel construction and rationalizing GST rates will help reduce the overall cost of accommodation. These measures will further stimulate domestic tourism and positively impact inbound tourism. The industry would be delighted if the Honourable Finance Minister allocates resources for an international campaign under the Incredible India initiative.The homestay sector is growing well in India, and this burgeoning sector needs support. The government's clarification in the last budget, stating that any rental income earned by the owner of residential house property shall be treated as ‘Income from House Property’ instead of ‘Business Income,’ can adversely impact the growth of homestays. We request the Honourable Minister to review this point.”“Besides, there are a couple of other operational, and disparity-related GST issues faced by Online Travel Agents (OTAs). Mandatory state-wise GST registration with a physical presence in every state unnecessarily adds to the administrative costs and management overhead. Since the nature of OTAs business is online, registration in different states can be allowed using their central head office address will help streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. Moreover, this requirement will help put Indian OTAs on a level playing field against international online players who are not bound by similar rules.Similarly, there is an existing disparity in the GST charge for customers booking a non-AC bus through an online booking platform. Customers are charged 5% GST, while direct bookings made with the bus operator do not incur a GST charge. This inconsistency undermines the objective of the Digital India initiative and is against the spirit of digital India.The government has laid a strong foundation – this budget is an opportunity to propel the sector into its next phase of growth.”Echoing his sentiment, Mehul Sharma , Founder & CEO of Signum Hotels and Resorts, shares, ""The hospitality sector is a cornerstone of India's service economy, contributing approximately 9% to the GDP and employing over 43 million people. In 2023, the sector witnessed a robust recovery, with domestic tourism growing by 30% and international arrivals rebounding by 25%. However, financing remains a significant challenge, especially for small and mid-sized businesses. Currently, interest rates for hospitality loans range from 10.75% to 22.50%, depending on the lender and borrower’s credit profile. For instance, HDFC Bank offers business loans with interest rates starting at 10.75%, while other financial institutions may charge higher rates based on various factors. Lowering these rates to a more affordable range, such as 7% to 8%, could significantly reduce the financial burden on these businesses, fostering growth and stability.”“Additionally, the sector faces a talent gap, with nearly 30% of hospitality positions unfilled due to a lack of trained professionals. Investing in skill development programs is essential to bridge this gap and enhance service quality. Furthermore, infrastructure upgrades, particularly in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, can boost the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) segment, which currently contributes 15% to the overall tourism revenue. Incentivizing sustainable and energy-efficient practices in hotels is also crucial, aligning the sector with global trends and reducing operational costs. Presently, the adoption of renewable energy in hospitality operations is at just 10%; government incentives could help scale this up, contributing to India's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070,” he quotes.On the other hand, Davinder Juj , General Manager, Eros Hotel, New Delhi, sharing his wishlist mentioned, “This budget, we expect the finance minister to consider our long pending request to give industry status to the hospitality sector irrespective of project costing and the city population. This will facilitate access to long-term loans at lower interest rates, enabling the construction of the infrastructure required to accommodate the growing demand. Being a strong and important pillar of the economy, we also look forward to the implementation of a uniform GST rate for the hospitality industry, which would streamline the GST process and stimulate corporate demand across states. We hope the finance minister will take steps to facilitate the sector’s growth and will increase budget allocations for tourism promotion, improve digital infrastructure, and support sustainability initiatives to attract more domestic and international tourists to the country.”Last but not least, Shreyas Kudalkar , Owner of Kings Hotel & Resort, expressed, “As we move through 2025, the concept of travel is undergoing a profound transformation. With rising costs and a renewed focus on sustainability, travelers are increasingly seeking meaningful experiences over material indulgence. Whether it’s exploring off-the-beaten-path destinations, immersing oneself in local cultures, or embracing nature through eco-tourism, the new wave of travelers is proving that adventure doesn’t require a lavish budget. The true value of travel now lies in the authentic connections made, the stories shared, and the unforgettable moments that unfold—showing us that sometimes, the most enriching journeys are those that are both affordable and deeply rewarding.”","The travel and tourism sector is vital in India's culturally rich and diverse landscape.

Speaking to TOI some of these students said that while such jobs are crucial to stay afloat in the US, they cannot risk their future especially given the hefty loans they have secured to land a seat at an American college.The US regulation allows international students on F-1 visas to work up to 20 hours a week on-campus.

PUNE: Six more people were detected with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) on Friday, taking the total patient count in the district to 73.The Union health ministry has decided to send a team of doctors to assist local authorities in investigating the cause of the GBS cases in the city.Of the six new cases, two patients were traced during the state’s door-to-door survey to educate people about GBS, an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the nerves. As on Friday, 14 patients are on ventilators.According to the state health department’s note, 44 patients are from rural Pune, 11 from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and 15 from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. The maximum patients are from Kirkitwadi (14), followed by DSK Vishwa (8), Nanded City (7) and Khadakwasala (6), a PMC note said.Of the 73 GBS patients, as many as 48 are male and 24 female. Three of them are below five years old.The national team from the central surveillance unit took cognizance of the spurt in GBS cases in Pune. It has called for a meeting with the state and civic officials. Dr Babita Kamalapurkar, joint director of epidemiology department, communicated with the central surveillance unit through a video meet and provided information about the patients on Friday.The state teams, along with PMC, PCMC and district health office, surveyed about 7,200 homes in two days. Most were along Sinhagad Road. “Anyone detected with GBS symptoms, like as numbness of limbs or prolonged diarrhoea, during the surveys are being advised to seek treatment,” said Dr Kamalapurkar.Hospitals, including Sassoon hospital, are stocking up on injectables and medicines to avoid IVIG injection shortage.Dr Eknath Pawar, dean at BJMC and Sassoon General Hospital, said, “We have 16 patients right now.

"Bank of Japan raises interest rate to about 0.5%, citing higher wages and inflation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bank-of-japan-raises-interest-rate-to-about-0-5-citing-higher-wages-and-inflation/articleshow/117510635.cms,"TOKYO: The Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate to about 0.5% from 0.25% Friday, noting that inflation is holding at a desirable target level.The decision by the central bank came at the end of a two-day policy board meeting in Tokyo.BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda, set to speak to reporters later in the day, repeatedly indicated the move was coming. Recent price data show inflation hovering at about the central bank's 2% target.Government data released hours before the decision showed consumer prices, excluding volatile food prices, rose last year at an average rate of 2.5%, marking the third straight year of increase. The consumer price index, excluding food, for the month of December alone showed a 3% rise.Another long-term concern was wage growth. Recent data show Japanese workers are gaining better wages and are generally set to receive solid pay raises in their upcoming annual union negotiations.The labor ministry adjusted its wage data for November to a rise of 0.5%, instead of a decline, helping to support the Bank of Japan's decision.The central bank has signaled that more interest rate raises may be coming, while stressing it plans to be extremely cautious to ensure the economy holds steady.Share prices fell after the announcement, as the value of the Japanese yen gained against the US dollar. A rate rise in July last year sent stock prices tumbling. The bank is also watching for market reactions to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.The Bank of Japan increased the rate for the first time in 17 years in March last year, ending its negative interest rate policy, which amounts to negative borrowing rates.Japan's longtime ultra-lax monetary policy was meant to wrest the economy out of deflationary tendencies and boost growth. Deflation stagnates growth, as companies invest less, cut back on wages and people hold back on spending.Japan's stance is at odds with the loosening trends adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have been cutting rates after raising them to clamp down on inflation. The Fed indicated recently it will slow the pace of rate cuts.",The Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate to about 0.5% from 0.25% Friday.

Justin Trudeau warns Donald Trump over tariff threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/prices-for-americans-will-go-up-trudeau-warns-trump-over-tariff-threat/articleshow/117503660.cms,"Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump (R)

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.Trump announced earlier in the day that he intends to apply a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, with implementation potentially starting as soon as February 1. He had previously threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China immediately after taking office, but they were not implemented on his first day.Speaking in Ottawa, outgoing PM Trudeau pointed out that Canada would respond with retaliatory tariffs if Trump moves forward. ""Whether it be back on January 20th, on February 1st or February 15th as a Valentine’s Day present, or on April 1st or whenever, Canada will respond,"" Trudeau said. ""Prices for American consumers on just about everything will go up. We don’t think he wants that.""The tariffs would target a wide range of products and could disrupt key markets, including autos, lumber, and oil. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith cautioned that Americans in some states could see gas prices increase by more than a dollar per gallon if Canadian oil faces additional tariffs. Despite Trump’s assertion that the US does not need Canada, nearly 25% of America’s daily oil consumption is supplied by its northern neighbour.Canada is also a critical supplier of 34 essential minerals and metals, as well as the largest foreign source of steel, aluminium, and uranium for the US Trudeau highlighted the importance of bilateral cooperation.""The US should be working even more with Canada on our energy, on our critical minerals, on the goods they need to deliver the economic growth that Donald Trump has promised,"" he said. ""That is our first choice. If they do move forward on tariffs, we are ready to respond in a strong way but in a way to figure out how to get them removed as soon as possible.""Canada is reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs on US products such as orange juice, toilets, and certain steel goods. This would mirror the response in 2018, when Canada imposed billions of dollars in duties after Trump raised tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. ""Everything is on the table,” Trudeau said. “It would be bad for Canada, but it would also be bad for American consumers.""The economic relationship between the two countries is significant, with nearly Canadian dollars 3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in goods and services crossing the border daily. Canada is also the top export destination for 36 US states. However, Trump has remained focused on border issues, linking Canada and Mexico to the flow of fentanyl into the US""We have highlighted that less than one percent of illegal drugs coming into the United States, less than one percent of migrants going into the United States, come from Canada, but we’re still investing over a billion dollars and strengthening our border,"" Trudeau said.Trump has also frequently mischaracterised the US-Canada trade relationship, claiming a $200 billion trade deficit, which experts have debunked. During a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum, he suggested a drastic solution. “You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we don’t have a deficit. We won’t have to tariff you,” he said.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs.

The producer group has millions of barrels a day in spare capacity that it could potentially return to the market - and it has pledged to gradually revive a chunk of this output starting in April after several delays.""I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil,"" Trump said in remarks delivered virtually to world leaders gathered in Davos on Thursday.

After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines. The recent launch of a spectacularly successful meme coin helped SOL reach its all-time high yet again. Speculators predict further growth, but several challengers are rising fast.For one, a new TON-based token has the potential to rival this success. Thanks to its significant utility and systemic importance, this token could be a top performer this cycle.After a major rally at the start of the bull market, Solana (SOL) is once again in the headlines. The “Ethereum killer” has attained new highs thanks to a major memecoin launch. Namely, just days before his inauguration, President Donald Trump launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) token. The token quickly attained a staggering valuation of $10 billion, making Trump one of the richest men alive.The token’s launch on Solana has created a market frenzy, pushing Solana to its new ATH at $290. Despite the subsequent volatility, Solana is still up 42% over the past seven days, trading at $254. Now, experts predict that the token can go even higher.The launch of Trump and Melania tokens on the network will likely boost its credibility. At the same time, Trump’s favourable stance toward crypto may prove to be even more consequential. If Solana cements its position as the meme coin hub, it has further potential to expand.Despite Solana’s significant growth, it is not without its challenges. Among them is TON , another high-performance blockchain with several aces up its sleeve. For one, TON has a deep connection with the Telegram messaging app.Telegram provides TON with access to its 950 million users. At the same time, it also enables real-world applications for the network. For one, TON-based apps are becoming more popular on Telegram. For example, popular clicker apps like Notcoin drew significant engagement.TON is also expanding into several new areas. Just in time for the next meme coin rally, TON has revealed a major partnership. Ethereum-based GraFun memecoin launchpad has recently joined the TON platform. This platform will enable the easy creation of meme coins on TON, just as Pump.fun did for Solana.Thanks to these developments, TON emerges as a potential Solana challenger. Moreover, the recent launch of Elluminex (ELX) could further boost its potential. The project aims to be the main trading hub for TON, injecting much-needed liquidity into the chain.Elluminex works as a DEX with cross-chain bridges to 40 major blockchains. This way, it helps bring together liquidity across major chains. This is crucial, as the introduction of major DEXs has had a significant impact on token prices.For instance, since the launch of Raydium, Solana grew from $1.5 to more than $200 in a single year. Ethereum saw similar effects after the launch of Uniswap, as did BNB with PancakeSwap. These examples showcase the importance of liquidity for the chains.Elluminex will also enable low-slippage trading with self-custody, appealing both to large traders and retail players. Thanks to the fact that the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to more than rival Solana’s performance.","After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines.

With a startling $190 trillion worth, the global payments sector is about to undergo a significant change as one viral altcoin is causing waves. The promising project Remittix ( RTX ), which combines blockchain technology with local payment networks, is addressing ongoing cross-border problems like sluggish processing times and excessive costs.But should Cardano (ADA) exhibit indications of a possible recovery, could this fresh rival challenge other top crypto coins and flip ADA's position? Remittix might be the crypto initiative that changes our perspective on cross-border transactions this year. Read on to find out why RTX has the potential to surpass ADA.Rising momentum makes Cardano (ADA) among the top altcoins to keep an eye on this year. Though there were occasional swings, the Cardano price increased more than 16% during the past week, showing a bullish momentum. At first, the Cardano price chart showed a bullish trend with higher highs and higher lows. But a brief bearish breakout saw the altcoin drop to $0.98 before rebounding with great positive momentum, moving it to the $1.09 resistance zone.The Cardano price has been steadily rising over the previous month, rising by more than 16% and keeping a good view among the crypto community. Though it still stands over 65% behind its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10, hope regarding a possible ATH retest in 2025 keeps rising. Reflecting a good blend of stability and growth, Cardano (ADA) noted green days in 53% of the last 30 days.Cardano (ADA) is still among the promising altcoins to watch given its strong fundamentals and bullish investor sentiment. Reiterating the positive sentiment shown on the Cardano price chart, indicators including the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages flash buy signals However, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) currently shows sale signals, indicating a possible pullback. Looking forward, analysts are bullish on Cardano (ADA) in 2025. A recent 2025 Cardano price prediction forecasts that the altcoin could trade in a price channel between $1 and $5 on average this year.Remittix is emerging as a promising project at a time when cross-border transactions are sometimes hampered by hefty fees and delayed processing periods. Moreover, Remittix provides a more affordable, efficient means for individuals and companies to transmit money all around the world by merging local payment systems with blockchain technology, therefore bridging cryptocurrencies and traditional banks.The desire for creative ideas like Remittix has never been stronger since the worldwide remittance market exceeds $750 billion yearly.

Remittix has addressed one of the most enduring issues in global payments by supporting more than forty cryptocurrencies and giving users the option to convert them to fiat and forward them to any bank account anywhere in the world.Remittix is well suited to profit from the rising need for quick, safe, competitively cost cross-border payment solutions. Investors are quite interested in the platform since its presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 252 million RTX tokens in a few weeks. Early buyers have a unique chance to join the presale at a shockingly low price of just $0.0256 per RTX token before the expected launch on tier-1 exchanges in the coming weeks.Remittix (RTX) is fast establishing itself as a game-changer in cross-border payments as the competition for dominance in the crypto arena gets more intense. Moreover, Remittix promises faster, less expensive, and more transparent solutions than conventional banking systems.Additionally, Remittix is a project worth investing in given an increasing presale success and a great chance to take a sizable portion of the $750 billion remittance market. Even though Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting indications of recovery, it is evident that the massive investor demand for the limited RTX token supply is poised to result in exponential gains shortly.Join the Remittix (RTX) presale and community:","Remittix (RTX) is transforming cross-border transactions.

Time to speak openly and plainly

Global Shapers

and decisions about the future

Looking for solutions and social accountability

The protest is small but loud. As limousines drive past, a few hundred young people have gathered on the Postplatz square in Davos, Switzerland.The high-altitude resort in the Alps that usually belongs to skiers looks different this week. Bakeries, cafes, and boutiques have been converted to host banks, companies, or whole countries for the next few days.A pub is now called ""Belgium House."" The old furniture has been cleared out and chic designer furniture and large advertising posters have been put in their place.The demonstrators outside shout ""Eat the rich"" and ""Tax the rich."" Some of them block the street. Their protest is directed at the participants of the World Economic Forum (WEF). They see the meeting, which runs from January 20-24, as a complete waste of money and time.""We are protesting against the lobby meeting of the rich and powerful in Davos. It is clear that they are the ones responsible for the current crises,"" says Mirjam Hostetmann from the youth organization Young Socialists Switzerland, which is connected to the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. The group is helping organize the demonstration under the motto ""Strike WEF.""Ines Yabar has a slightly different view of the event.The young Peruvian was invited as a guest to the World Economic Forum this year. In Lima, she works with others to protect the environment, addresses social problems, and is active as a Global Shaper. This global network of young, committed people between the ages of 20 and 30 is supported by the WEF but organizes itself independently.In Davos, Yabar wants to discuss things with those in power and build bridges, but she also plans to speak plainly. At the same time, she can understand why there are demonstrations outside.""I feel that this shows that young people care and wherever we can we will be protesting because it is important to raise our voice about issues we are passionate about,"" says Yabar. ""But we will also be in rooms where we can talk with people deliberately and intentionally that are making decisions that affect our future.""This year, 50 Global Shapers from around the world will take part in the discussions in Davos.They will discuss social justice , climate change, artificial intelligence (AI) and many other important topics.Being present in Davos is an opportunity for many, especially since many young people are dissatisfied. The current situation cannot continue, says Olajumoke Adekeye.The Nigerian member of the Global Shapers Community is appalled because only 2.8% of the world's parliamentarians are under the age of 30, she says. In sub-Saharan Africa, a large proportion of the population is under 25, but when it comes to decisions that affect their future, they are not heard. And that's why she is here.Indeed, for the next few days her schedule is full. She will need all her energy to meet her mandate of ""seeding ideas about how young people can be empowered to take on greater responsibility.""""Together both the youth within these walls and outside send a strong message that there is really change that can be made,"" says Adekeye, when asked about being a part of a youth delegation inside the WEF while young people protested outside.Akshay Saxena from India also believes in the power of the young and is looking for change.""Too many decisions for the majority are made by a very small group of people,"" he says.He supports young talent through the organization Avanti Fellows where he is co-CEO. They focus on children from poor families who have little access to the education system.""There are so many bright kids, exceptional people, their talent is often wasted,"" he muses. For his work, Saxena is being honored as the Social Entrepreneur of the Year at this year's WEF meeting.""If capitalism is going to work, it is critical that people who own a lot, share some of their wealth. That is their social responsibility,"" he says.Around 70,000 young Indians have taken part in Avanti Fellows' online courses on mathematics, technology, and various science subjects. Others receive targeted support in schools through the organization's programs.Saxena proudly reports on participants who graduated from the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US after receiving funding. ""My approach is solution-based,"" he says, pulling a blanket closer to keep himself warm.His gaze wanders over the Swiss mountains. ""Problems should be solved by people who are most affected,"" says Saxena, reflecting on the issues at hand. ""There is certainly a truth in this.""","Young people are protesting outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They see the meeting as a complete waste of money and time.

Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses due to heightened rivalry from Amazon and Temu.Wesfarmers , which acquired the online retailer for $230million in 2019, issued a closure announcement on Tuesday.According to a Daily Mail report, the company expects an operational deficit reaching $40million in the initial half of 2024-25.“While Catch's financial performance has been challenging, we have gained valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the group's digital transformation and supported the development of the OnePass membership program,” Daily Mail quoted Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott as saying.The company cited intense rivalry from international online retailers such as Temu, Shein, and Amazon.“The recent increase in competitive intensity in the Australian e-commerce sector has affected Catch's financial performance and growth prospects,” according to the announcement.Whilst 100 positions will be preserved and transferred to other Wesfarmers subsidiaries like Kmart, 190 positions will be eliminated.The logistics centres will transition to Kmart's control during the final quarter of 2024-25.Kmart Group Managing Director Ian Bailey indicated the arrangement would enhance customer service through access to Catch's Moorebank warehouse in Sydney's south-west.“Kmart Group can better utilise Catch's fulfilment centres, which are currently less than 50 per cent utilised. The transition will result in faster deliveries to customers at a lower unit cost, while relieving pressure on our busy stores,” he explained.Established by Gabby and Hezi Leibovich as Catch of the Day in 2006, the business gained popularity amongst value-conscious Australian shoppers but ultimately struggled against competitors who faced fewer operational costs and taxes.","Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses.

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

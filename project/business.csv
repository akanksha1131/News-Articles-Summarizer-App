"‘Golden Age’: US, Japan sign agreement on 'securing' supply of rare earths; ahead of Donald Trump's meeting with Xi Jinping",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/golden-age-us-japan-sign-agreement-on-securing-supply-of-rare-earths-ahead-of-donald-trumps-meeting-with-xi-jinping/articleshow/124862151.cms,"Xi Flexes Nuke Muscle Before Meeting Trump; H-6k Bombers, J-10 Jets Drop Missiles | 'TAIWAN VISIBLE'

The rare earth standoff



Message to Xi?







The United States and Japan have signed a new deal aimed at securing supplies of critical minerals and rare earths, as President Donald Trump hailed a “golden age” in relations with Tokyo. The agreement, signed during Trump’s visit to Japan on Tuesday, reflects a growing effort by Washington to reduce its dependence on China for vital resources that power everything from electric cars to fighter jets.According to the White House, the framework is designed to ensure “resilience and security of critical minerals and rare earths supply chains.” The pact comes just days after Trump announced similar memoranda of understanding with Malaysia and Thailand, marking a coordinated push to diversify sources of rare earth materials across the Indo-Pacific.Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s first female leader, hosted Trump at Tokyo’s Akasaka Palace. “This is the greatest alliance in the world,” she said, pledging to build a “new golden era” in US-Japan relations. Trump returned the praise, calling her leadership a “big deal” and promising that “anything I can do to help Japan, we will be there.”The Tokyo deal comes at a tense moment in the global race for rare earth dominance.China controls around 70 per cent of global mining and nearly 90 per cent of refining capacity for these elements, which are essential for advanced technologies including smartphones, electric vehicles and military aircraft.Beijing recently expanded export controls, requiring government approval for any products containing even trace amounts of rare earths. The move, described by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as “China pointing a bazooka at the world’s supply chains,” reignited tensions after months of calm between the two powers.Trump’s counter-strategy has been to build alliances to weaken Beijing’s grip. In Kuala Lumpur earlier this week, he signed deals with Malaysia and Thailand to bolster production and exports of critical minerals, following an $8.5 billion US-Australia framework agreement. “In about a year from now, we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earths, and you won’t know what to do with them,” Trump said confidently on Monday.Experts, however, warn that such optimism may be premature. “China is too far ahead of the world,” said John Mavrogenes, professor of economic geology at the Australian National University, who estimated that alternative supply chains could take a decade to fully develop.Beyond its economic implications, Tuesday’s signing ceremony was rich in symbolism. Trump and Takaichi also inked a brief one-page declaration heralding the “golden age” of their nations’ alliance — a gesture intended to reaffirm America’s strategic commitment to Japan as both countries navigate the shifting power balance in Asia.The deal also arrives days before Trump’s expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, where trade and rare earths are likely to dominate talks. Analysts say the new Japan agreement sends a clear signal to Beijing that Washington is working to fortify supply lines with trusted allies.“By building alternative networks, the US increases its leverage in negotiations with China,” Charles Chang of Fudan University told South China Morning Post. “Even if production takes time, it changes the dynamics.”Takaichi, a protégé of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, presented the US president with gestures of goodwill — 250 cherry trees for America’s 250th anniversary and fireworks from Akita Prefecture for the 4 July celebrations — reinforcing the sense of friendship amid hard-nosed diplomacy.","President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi signed a new deal aimed at securing supplies of critical minerals and rare earths.

Gold price prediction: Why are gold prices under pressure and what's the outlook? What investors should know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-october-28-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/124862378.cms,"Gold is likely to be under pressure in the near-term as bears eye the test of support around $3822.

are likely to remain under pressure ahead of the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

The analyst shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:



On October 27, spot gold tumbled below the psychologically crucial $4000 level on trade optimism as US and China trade negotiating teams said that they have reached a trade deal framework on multiple trade issues ahead of the much-anticipated Trump-Xi meeting scheduled for October 30.

At the time of writing this article, the spot gold was trading at $3986, down over 3% for the day, while the MCX December gold contract at Rs 120,546 was down by 2.35%.

Earlier, in the week ending October 24, the shiny metal tumbled 3.29% to $4112; thus, posting its first weekly loss in ten weeks.

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

US-China trade truce:

The US and China, after two-day talk in Malaysia, have reportedly reached a preliminary consensus on issues like export controls, fentanyl and shipping levies.

US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that the proposed 100% tariff on China is off the table now and differences over the sale of Tik Tok could be resolved.

He was optimistic that China will delay its latest rare earth controls for a year. It is to be noted that rare earths are needed to produce advanced products ranging from semiconductors to defence equipment.

China is expected to start buying US soybeans that it had stopped before the harvest season.

Trump and Xi are set to finalize the deals as the former said that he expects a good deal with China, adding that additional leader-level follow-up meetings may happen in China and the US.

Data roundup:

The much-awaited US CPI report (September) released on Friday showed cooler-than-expected readings across-the-board as headline CPI rose 0.3% m-o-m (forecast 0.4%, prior 0.4%). Core CPI rose 0.2% m-o-m (forecast 0.3%, prior 0.3%). The headline CPI was up 3% y-o-y (forecast 3.1%, prior 2.9%), while core CPI rose 3% y-o-y (forecast 3.1%, prior 3.1%). CPI inflation clearly running well-above the Fed's target of 2%; however, data coming in cooler-than-expected and remaining around the recent ranges as tariff passthrough is slow, sealed the Fed rate cut in October. Traders have almost fully priced in a 25-bps rate cut in December, too.

S&P US Composite PMI (Oct. prel.) came in at 54.80 Vs the forecast of 53.50 on stellar services and manufacturing PMIs.

University of Michigan (October final) came in at 53.60 Vs the forecast of 54.50 (prior data 55) as current conditions also deteriorated. One-year inflation expectations, although quite elevated at 4.6%, matched the median estimate, while 5-10 year-inflation expectations at 3.9% were hotter than the expectation of 3.7% (prior 3.7%).

LBMA conference:

The London Bullion Market Association's conference started on Sunday in Kyoto, Japan. The Conference would be attended by gold traders, brokers, and refiners.

John Reade, market strategist at World Gold Council, said at the LBMA conference that central bank demand is not as strong as it was earlier. He added that his conversation with traders reflected that gold prices may have to fall further after a steep rally in the last three months.

Gold ETFs:

Total known global gold ETF holdings fell for the third straight day to 98.19Moz as of October 24, as ETF holdings witnessed the first net weekly outflow after eight consecutive weeks of net positive inflows.

Nonetheless, ETF holdings continue to hover around 3-year high as holdings have risen 15.62% YTD.

US Dollar Index and US yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index at 98.06 was down nearly 0.1% for the day.

Ten-year US yields at 4.015% were up 1.5 bps, while 2-year yields rose 3 bps to 3.51%.

Bessent confirms the names of five Fed Chair finalists:

Bessent has named five Fed Chair finalists ahead of the year-end decision. The candidates include the Fed Governors Waller and Bowman, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Reider.

Moody's changes the sovereign debt outlook for France to negative:

The rating agency Moody's changed the French sovereign debt outlook to negative due to political instability that may culminate into a faster weakening of the nation's key fiscal parameters, though it retained its Aa3 rating.

Upcoming data and events:

Major US data on tap this week include US Conference Board consumer confidence (October 28), advance goods trade balance (Oct. 29), 3Q advance GDP and Core PCE Price Index QoQ (Oct. 30) and September PCE Price Index (October 31) – the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation.

The Eurozone's 3Q GDP data will be released on Oct. 30.

This week is packed with monetary policy decisions of key central banks. The US FOMC is expected to cut the overnight Fed Fund rate by 25 bps in its monetary policy due on October 29.

Bank of Canada is widely expected to cut rates by 25 bps to 2.25% on October 29 as the growth falters amid tariff wars.

The European Central Bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged in its policy to be announced on October 31, as core inflation is running at 2.3% y-o-y.

Similarly, the Bank of Japan is expected to stand pat on its interest rate in its monetary policy decision due on October 30.

Gold Price Outlook:

Gold is expected to remain under pressure ahead of the Trump--Xi meeting on October 30 as trade deal optimism takes CenterStage.

While there may be further progress on some sectoral issues through talks between the US and China, key issues like national security, state subsidies, technical race and Trump's agenda of financial imbalance remain unresolved. In addition, in a contentious development, the US is launching a trade investigation into whether China fully implemented its commitments under the phase one agreement and will be deciding on required actions.

Gold is likely to be under pressure in the near-term as bears eye the test of support around $3822. Interim support is around $3950. Fed rate cut expectations will limit the downside.

Resistance is noted around $4160/$4200.

On a long-term horizon, we look for a target of $5,000 by the end of 2026 and suggest accumulating the metal in downward correction.

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver is vulnerable after falling through the support zone of $47.50-$47.80. However, it is looking quite oversold after falling nearly 15% from its peak of $54.49.

US-China trade truce will be positive for the metal. Although downside pressure persists, we suggest accumulating the metal for medium to long term.

Support is at $45.70, followed by $44. Resistance is at $47.80/$48.50.

China Agrees To New Trade Talks After Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs | Watch





US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to discuss a proposed trade framework on Thursday that could see Washington reduce tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Beijing’s commitment to curb exports of fentanyl precursor chemicals, according to The Wall Street Journal.As per The Wall Street Journal report cited by news agency Reuters, the plan under discussion would involve the US rolling back a portion of its 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports by up to 10% if China pledges stricter controls on precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl, a synthetic opioid blamed for hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in recent years.The meeting between Trump and Xi is expected to take place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, marking their first in-person engagement since Trump’s return to the White House in January.Earlier, Trump told reporters before departing on his Asia visit that “we have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us… I think we’ll have a good meeting.”Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated in recent months, with Trump threatening new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods from November 1 after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths — minerals crucial for smartphones and defence equipment.China has justified the restrictions as measures to protect “national security.”Trump has repeatedly pressed Beijing to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States, while also seeking trade concessions that could help American farmers. “I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal,” he said earlier, noting that soy trade and Chinese purchases of Russian oil could also be discussed.China’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang recently said both sides had reached “a preliminary consensus on a range of issues.”Markets are watching the meeting closely amid hopes it could help resolve the ongoing trade war that has rattled the global economy.",US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to discuss a proposed trade framework on Thursday.

Gold Price Outlook: Weekly View

Spot Gold (CMP 3918/Oz) – Volatile to Limited Upside

Spot Silver (CMP 46.27/Oz) – Negative Bias

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold and silver prices may continue to decline in the near term, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his views and recommendations for gold investors:Gold & Silver lost their festive shine in the last week, tumbling from record highs & snapping a nine-week rally as trade optimism between India - China amid falling global prices & easing global shortage in Silver market triggered profit-booking by investors.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for December delivery plummeted by 2.80 per cent last week as Silver futures also succumbed to profit-taking, with the December contract crashing by almost 6 %. Both metals had been on a rise since the week ended on August 22 till Diwali festive.Gold selling also persisted this week as signs of easing trade tensions between the US & China continued to undermine demand for traditional safe-haven assets. The downfall led to an over three-week low which could also be attributed to technical selling following an intraday failure to find acceptance above the $4,000 psychological mark.Meanwhile, dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations dragged the US Dollar (USD) lower this week, though it did little to lend any support to Gold. Even economic risks stemming from a prolonged US government shutdown failed to provide any respite for the bulls.This backs the case for further losses as the focus shifts to a two-day FOMC meeting ahead this week.Bullions are expected to trade with potential for further losses in the current week amid upcoming global central bank meetings. On Wednesday, the Fed will announce its monetary policy decision following a two-day meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows that markets are fully pricing in a 25-basis-points (bps) interest rate cut. Because such a decision is unlikely to trigger a market reaction, investors will scrutinize the tone of policy statement & comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the post-meeting press conference.Renewed optimism about US - China trade discussions could also cap safe-haven flows to gold. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier stated on Sunday that the US and China could agree on the framework of a potential trade deal that will be discussed when US President Donald Trump & Chinese President Xi Jinping meet later this week. This, in turn, remains supportive of the upbeat mood around the equity markets and might hold back traders from placing fresh bullish bets around the bullions pair heading into this week's key central bank event risks.Spot Silver also continued to decline this week hitting a one-month low at $45.56 earlier in the day as the market entered a normalization phase after a record wave of free-floating metal inflows into London vaults, reducing the need for elevated prices to attract additional supply. The drop also came amid softer Indian demand post end of Diwali festival amid speculative position unwinding and easing physical activities continue to drive prices down.Spot gold is expected to trade with limited upside bias as a breach of $ 4000 /Oz psychological support this week now gives way to $ 3850 – 3730 /Oz next support levels which may be translated to Rs. 1,15,800 - 1,14,200 / 10 gm. supports MCX to be tested this week.Spot Silver on the other hand could now likely decline towards $ 44 - 45 /Oz support in near term translating to levels of Rs. 1,37,000 - 1,36,000 on MCX futures contract.","Gold and silver prices may continue to decline in the near term, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

prediction markets





Truth Social users will soon be able to explore beyond posts and political commentary, by making bets on the possibility of events like election results and economic prediction.US President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social is expanding with the introduction of real-world event betting directly on the app.Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) on Tuesday announced that users would be able to place wagers on outcomes across politics, economics, sports and entertainment. The move is being rolled out through a partnership with Crypto.com, and will let users bet on “elections, interest rates and inflation rate changes, commodity prices on gold and crude oil,” or on events from “all major sports leagues.”“Prediction markets,” unlike casino-style betting, do not fall under the gambling category, according to federal authorities. Users need to buy a “contract,” essentially a financial position that pays out if the user’s forecast is correct. For instance, predicting the election results for a candidate or choosing the team expected to win a match.They are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), rather than state gambling regulators that oversee casinos and lotteries.Prediction markets have soared in popularity, particularly on mobile apps, and are attracting major financial interest. Earlier this month, Intercontinental Exchange, the company that operates the New York Stock Exchange, committed $2 billion to Polymarket, one of the most prominent platforms in the space.The surge has also sparked warnings, as these apps have become especially popular among young adults, raising concerns about addiction and the potential for users to incur significant financial losses.For TMTG, the move into betting comes as the company continues to search for stronger revenue streams. It has experimented with cryptocurrency-linked financial products and launched a video streaming platform.Despite these efforts, the company generated only $1.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2025, while posting a net loss of $51.7 million, according to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.","Truth Social users will be able to place wagers on outcomes across politics, economics, sports and entertainment.

CLSA has a high conviction outperform rating on Indus Tower with the target price at Rs 520. Analysts said the company’s July-Sept (Q2FY26) core revenue was up 11% on the year that was ahead of estimates.

Analysts feel that the company is delivering well in tough times. Its Q2FY26 revenue beat was led by railways and traction motors. They believe potential business wins from struggling auto component suppliers in the EU will be a key upside for Sona BLW. With order wins across multiple segments, further ramp-up in traction/suspension motor, railway etc. will diversify the revenue mix further. At current valuations the stock looks attractive.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Indian Oil Corp (IOC) with the target price at Rs 168.

Analysts said they were looking for clarity on future Russian oil imports.UBS has a buy rating on PNB Housing Finance with the target price at Rs 1,200. Analysts said the Q2FY26 was a steady quarter while appointment of its CEO was awaited. They said loans to emerging and affordable houses is now 38% of PNB Housing’s loan book. The company reduced its base rate by 10 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point) during the quarter while cost of funds declined by nearly 15 basis points during the April-Sept period. The company also maintained net interest margin (NIM) guidance of 3.7% for FY26.

MUMBAI: Mehli Mistry's non-continuation as a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust may or may not lead to a legal battle as experts say that there is no legal or statutory right to demand renewal of a trusteeship, unless the trust deed explicitly provides for grant of life trusteeship to a member or a class of members.While there is a reference to an Oct 2024 resolution that seeks to bestow life trusteeship to trustees at the time of renewal, as a possible basis to launch a legal battle, other legal experts say such a resolution may lack enforceability unless the trust deed was already amended to include such a provision.Senior advocate Pinky Anand said voting out Mehli Mistry may be challenged in court on the contention that it is contrary to the decision taken by the boards of the charities for unanimous reappointment.

Tata vs Mistry again: Majority votes to oust Mehli from Trusts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-vs-mistry-again-majority-votes-to-oust-mehli-from-trusts/articleshow/124886714.cms,"Noel Tata needs to manage growing internal divisions





MUMBAI: Mehli Mistry, Ratan Tata 's long-time confidant, executor of his will, and a man widely seen as custodian of the late chairman's legacy, has been denied reappointment as lifelong trustee of the Tata Trusts.The decision was taken after Noel Tata, chairman of the Trusts, and vice-chairmen Venu Srinivasan and Vijay Singh declined to give their consent, marking a rare break from the convention of unanimity in the apex bodies that control Tata Sons Three others, Pramit Jhaveri, Darius Khambata and Jehangir Jehangir, were in favour of Mistry's reappointment while Ratan Tata's brother Jimmy Tata abstained from the vote. Since the resolution concerned him, Mistry did not participate in the vote.The two main philanthropic arms of Tata Trusts - Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) and Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT) - follow different voting systems: as per the trust deed, a simple majority is required at SDTT and unanimity at SRTT. For appointments and removals of trustees, however, unanimous consent is required. Based on these provisions, Mistry's three-year tenure at the Trusts formally ended Tuesday, on a 3-2 vote.Four trustees, Noel Tata, Srinivasan, Singh and Khambata, sit on both SDTT and SRTT. Others are Jhaveri at SDTT and Jehangir Jehangir and Jimmy Tata at SRTT. The vote across the two trusts thus stood at three against Mistry's reappointment and two in favour.Mistry had earlier described the process of trustee renewal as a ""procedural formality,"" referring to an Oct 17, 2024 resolution passed unanimously by the Trusts, which said on ""expiry of tenure of any trustee, that trustee will be reappointed by the concerned Trust without any limit being attached to the period of tenure.""When Srinivasan was made a lifelong trustee last week, Mistry had backed the move but added a caveat in writing: ""Should any trustee elect not to pass this resolution reappointing Srinivasan, or an identical unanimous resolution for all other trustees as and when their respective tenures expire, then in such event, I do not provide my formal approval for the reappointment of Srinivasan"".A senior lawyer, however, said there cannot be such conditional approval to a resolution: it must be either yes or no. His probable legal recourse, if any, could only involve action against the Trusts on the grounds that three trustees violated the unanimous Oct 17, 2024 resolution. But this would mean questioning the rules laid down in the original trust deed. If Mistry proceeds legally, he will be the second Mistry to take on a Tata in less than a decade, setting the stage for a potential Mistry vs Tata scenario.If his removal raises the prospect of a courtroom battle, it also underscores growing divisions within the Trusts that together hold about 66% of Tata Sons. For Noel Tata, the development presents immediate challenges: managing internal discord and addressing the possibility of another Mistry-versus-Tata standoff, nine years after the first one that shook the group in 2016. Interestingly, Mehli, who is Cyrus's first cousin, had proposed Noel as Trusts chairman soon after Ratan Tata's passing in 2024. Differences among trustees widened last month when Mistry, Jhaveri, Khambata, and Jehangir voted to remove Singh as the Trusts' nominee on the board of Tata Sons.The four raised governance concerns saying they were not kept informed by nominee directors on matters related to investments of over Rs 100 crore by Tata Sons as per the Articles of Association. Consensus within Tata Trusts is now becoming a crucial issue for Tata Sons as it navigates growth and a debate over a public listing. The issue of governance will now continue to loom over India's largest conglomerate as it moves forward, posing questions for regulators and investors.","Mehli Mistry has been denied reappointment as lifelong trustee of the Tata Trusts.

Jimmy Tata’s absence speaks loudly at Trusts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jimmy-tatas-absence-speaks-loudly-at-trusts/articleshow/124886564.cms,"



MUMBAI: He says nothing and chooses not to vote, but his silence speaks volumes at Tata Trusts. Jimmy Naval Tata, 85, the reclusive younger brother of the late Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata and a trustee of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT), stayed away from voting on Tuesday on Mehli Mistry's reappointment as a lifelong trustee. Yet his silence mattered.SRTT follows a unique voting system where resolutions require unanimous approval from trustees. In this context, Jimmy's decision not to participate was significant. His vote can sway key decisions at SRTT and within the broader Tata Trusts, but he typically refrains from board discussions and resolutions. If even one trustee at SRTT votes against a proposal, it fails. By contrast, resolutions at the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) need only a majority vote.When TOI asked Jimmy Tata about the events at Tata Trusts, including Mistry's reappointment and the reported differences among trustees, he said, ""I would not like to comment.""Joint minutes of SRTT and SDTT show that Jimmy ""did not attend"" the Oct 17, 2024, meeting where major decisions, including the terms for reappointment of a trustee for life, were taken.Currently based in Pune, Jimmy, who keeps himself informed about developments within the Tata Group, particularly at Tata Trusts and Tata Sons , was last seen publicly at Ratan Tata's funeral in Mumbai on Oct 10 last year.In his will, Ratan Tata left his share in the family's Juhu property, along with jewellery and silver articles, to Jimmy. He also owns 3,262 shares of Tata Sons, valued at several crores of rupees. Jimmy inherited his trusteeship at SRTT under his father Naval Tata's will.But unlike his elder brother, who steered the Tata Group through decades of expansion, Jimmy has stayed away from corporate affairs. In a 2016 conversation with TOI from his modest two-bedroom apartment in Hampton Court, Colaba, he said he began his career in the Tata Group’s textile business under his father but later moved away as the industry ran into challenges.An avid squash player, Jimmy was once praised by RPG Group chairman Harsh Goenka for always defeating him, a memory Goenka shared in a post on X. Newspapers remain Jimmy’s main link to the world outside, and it is through them that he is likely to read about the latest developments.","Jimmy Naval Tata, 85, is the reclusive younger brother of the late Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata.

Mehli Mistry exits Tatas’ inner circle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mehli-mistry-exits-tatas-inner-circle/articleshow/124886435.cms,"Mehli Mistry





MUMBAI: For someone at the heart of one of India's most storied corporate families, Mehli Mistry has long remained an enigma: a man who moves within the most rarefied Parsi circles yet stays almost invisible to the public eye. Photographs of him are scarce; party appearances rarer still. He doesn't drink, avoids the social circuit, and spends most of the year in London, where he holds British citizenship. But inside the closely guarded world of the Tata Trusts, Mehli Mistry was anything but silent.The non-renewal of his trusteeship for life from the boards of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust ends a three-year stint that began with Ratan Tata's personal endorsement. A long-time confidant of the late industrialist, Mehli was seen as one of his closest allies and a protector of the Tata legacy. His ouster marks another turning point for the Trusts that collectively hold 66% of Tata Sons , the holding company of the $180-billion Tata Group The 65-year-old's association with Ratan Tata goes back several decades. Both lived in the same Colaba apartment complex, Bakhtawar, and their shared Parsi roots helped forge a friendship that would endure corporate upheavals and family feuds. Those who have seen them together describe Mehli as quietly devoted to Tata, someone who preferred to operate behind the scenes but was unafraid to voice his views at Trusts' meetings.Appointed trustee in late 2022, Mehli quickly became known for his insistence on governance standards and for reminding colleagues of the founding ethos of the Tata Trusts. ""I'll do whatever he wants me to do. I have to secure his interests at all times,"" he had said shortly after joining, referring to Ratan Tata as his mentor.That loyalty had long been visible. When the Tata-Mistry clash erupted in 2016 with the ouster of Cyrus Mistry from chairmanship of Tata Sons, Mehli chose to back Ratan Tata over his own cousin. It was a decision that widened an already strained family relationship. His mother and Cyrus's mother are sisters, and the families are also connected through their fathers, both descendants of the founders of the Pallonji construction empire.Mehli heads the smaller M Pallonji Group, which operates in shipping, dredging, auto dealerships and counts Tata companies among its associates. The two business houses have been linked since the 1950s, with Mehli's firm working with Tata Power and Tata Motors over the years.Despite those ties, Mehli has maintained a modest public profile; though he grew close enough to Ratan Tata to execute his will and inherit his Alibaug bungalow and heirloom guns, he has managed to stay out of the spotlight. His appointment to the Trusts in 2022, several months before Tata's death, was widely seen as an effort to ensure continuity of vision.That continuity, however, appears to have frayed since Tata's passing. The non-renewal of his reappointment was the result of a majority vote by trustees including Noel Tata, Venu Srinivasan and Vijay Singh, who chose to break away from the convention of unanimity that the Trusts have long observed. Coincidentally, it comes in Oct, the same month that Cyrus Mistry was ousted from Tata Sons nine years ago.For a family already divided by one corporate rupture, the latest development adds another twist. Mehli's equation with Noel Tata, Ratan Tata's half-brother, too was once cordial. He had even proposed Noel's name for chairman of the two main trusts after Ratan Tata's death. Now, Noel is among those who have voted against his trusteeship.Within the Tata ecosystem, Mehli was always viewed as more custodian than operator, deeply conscious of the group's founding principles even though he preferred not to be in the limelight. His associates say his interventions were often pointed, especially on governance and the need to uphold the trusts' independence.Married and father to Laila Mistry, who is engaged to a member of the Piramal family, Mehli continues to spend most of his time overseas. Whether he will challenge his ouster remains to be seen. For now, it closes another chapter in the evolving story of the Tata Trusts, one that has revealed the churn within the group it controls. And for Mehli Mistry, the man who once stood guard over Ratan Tata's legacy, it marks a quiet but symbolic exit from the inner circle he helped defend.","Mehli Mistry was a long-time confidant of the late industrialist Ratan Tata.

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday proposed up to 15 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point) cut in charges that investors pay to open ended mutual funds with the lowest slab at 0.9% for equity funds above certain threshold assets under management (AUM) and 0.7% for non-equity funds. Currently, the minimum charges are 1.05% for equity and 0.8% for non-equity schemes, respectively.For close ended funds the charges could be cut as much as 25 basis points to 1% for equity schemes and by 20 basis points to 0.8% for other such schemes.Sebi also proposed to drastically cut brokerage that MFs pay to stock brokers, from a maximum of 12 basis points now to 2 basis points. Currently, on an average most fund houses pay equity brokerage of about 6-8 basis points, head of a domestic fund house said.Fund industry veterans said that if these proposals are made into rules, investors would gain the most. They also said if proposals become rules and fund houses are forced to pay current rate of commissions to MF distributors, it would hurt revenue and profitability of some of the asset management companies. Fund houses with large equity AUM would be hit more than those with AUM balanced between debt and equity, or more skewed towards debt AUM, they said.Although Sebi proposed the changes after a detailed survey among fund houses about 6-8 months ago, industry officials said they would make representations to the regulator for lower cut in expenses than what have been proposed.Sebi also specified that under the rules being proposed, all the statutory charges like securities transaction tax (STT), GST, stamp duty etc would be borne by the investors, ""so that any change in statutory levy in future are passed on to the investors""."," markets regulator Sebi proposed up to 15 basis points cut in charges that investors pay to open ended mutual funds.

Explained: Toronto’s condo market hits a 30-year low — why it matters now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-torontos-condo-market-hits-a-30-year-low-why-it-matters-now/articleshow/124875706.cms,"Toronto’s new condo sales fell 90% below the 10-year average in September 2025, signaling a market frozen by costs/ Image: Pexels

The big picture



What the report found



Condo sales collapse: Only 28 new condos sold in Toronto proper and 155 across the GTA in September 2025. That’s 90% below the 10-year average.

New home sales remain weak: Across all housing types (detached, semi-detached, townhomes, condos), there were 438 new home sales, down 29% year-on-year and 80% below the 10-year average.

Prices flat at a ‘floor’: The benchmark price for new condos in the GTA held steady at $1.033 million, while new single-family homes averaged $1.437 million, down 8% year-on-year.

Supply tightening: Developers added few new units to the market, meaning total inventory fell slightly.

Future supply risk: Low current sales mean fewer projects will break ground, potentially creating a severe housing shortage by 2027–2028, according to BILD spokesperson Justin Sherwood.

Why it matters



The current slump is driven by affordability pressures:

High interest rates have pushed monthly mortgage payments beyond reach for many buyers.

Rising construction and land costs mean developers struggle to build profitably at prices people can afford.

Government fees and development charges continue to add tens of thousands of dollars to new home prices.

Human and policy angle



The way forward







Toronto’s new condo market has crashed to levels not seen since the 1990s. Just 28 new condominium units were sold within the city in September, and 155 across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD). The figures represent a 90 per cent decline from the 10-year average, a sign of how deeply Canada’s largest housing market has frozen.After years of relentless price growth and a construction boom, Toronto’s housing market has entered a prolonged slump. The latest BILD data, compiled by Altus Group, paints a bleak picture of new home demand as developers struggle to attract buyers amid high borrowing costs, steep development charges, and affordability challenges.The slowdown is not confined to Toronto. All major Canadian housing markets, from Vancouver to Calgary, are facing a similar chill as the era of cheap money ends and buyers retreat to the sidelines.Toronto’s housing market is central to Canada’s economy. The city’s real estate sector drives construction jobs, investment, and consumer spending. When sales plummet to 1990s levels, it signals deep structural distress, both for developers and policymakers.This combination has effectively frozen the pre-construction condo market, a critical segment that finances much of the city’s future housing supply.For developers, these numbers translate into shelved projects and layoffs in construction. For buyers, it’s a paradox: even as sales collapse, prices haven’t fallen enough to make homes affordable.The result is a standstill where neither side can move. BILD and other industry groups are urging the federal and provincial governments to cut taxes and reduce development fees to revive the sector. They argue that without intervention, today’s slowdown will worsen tomorrow’s housing shortage.Ontario’s new Bill 60, the “Fighting Delays, Building Faster Act” — aims to “standardize and streamline” development charges, but details remain limited. The industry says implementation will take time, while the need for relief is immediate.Experts warn that unless policy shifts soon, Toronto could face a two-stage crisis: a short-term construction freeze followed by a long-term supply crunch. Lower inflation and potential interest rate cuts could help restore confidence, but developers insist that government action on costs is essential for recovery.For now, the city’s skyline may remain dotted with cranes, but many are standing idle.Toronto’s collapsing condo sales are a warning that Canada’s housing market, long sustained by optimism and low rates, is running out of financial and policy runwa",Only 28 new condos sold in Toronto proper and 155 across the GTA in September 2025.

The bottom line





For years, Lululemon has been the unofficial uniform of the yoga studio — stretchy, sleek, and quietly elite. Now it’s suiting up for Sunday football. The Canadian brand has teamed up with the NFL and Fanatics to launch a new line of officially licensed apparel and accessories for all 32 teams, marking its boldest leap yet from boutique wellness to the bruising world of American sport.The collection, debuting Tuesday, features both men’s and women’s gear, including Lululemon’s fan favourites like the Steady State men’s range and women’s Define, Scuba, and Align lines — now reimagined with team logos and colours. It’s the first time the brand has produced officially licensed NFL merchandise, and the release will be supported by a campaign starring Joe Montana, Nick Foles, Ryan Clark, and Emmanuel Acho.For Lululemon, the partnership is more than a marketing stunt — it’s a statement of intent. The brand has spent years trying to shed its “yoga-only” label, expanding into running, tennis, golf, and even Formula 1 through collaborations with stars like Lewis Hamilton. The NFL, on the other hand, gains a new gateway to female and lifestyle-conscious audiences who might not buy jerseys but will happily spend $120 on leggings with their team’s emblem.Investors liked what they saw. Lululemon’s stock jumped in early trading following the announcement, as the deal positions the company within one of the world’s most profitable merchandising ecosystems. With traditional fanwear saturated by T-shirts and hoodies, this move into premium athleisure opens a fresh, higher-margin lane for both the retailer and the league.The collaboration reflects a broader trend in sportswear — where identity, fashion, and fandom increasingly overlap. For the NFL, it’s a chance to modernise its image and appeal to audiences who view fandom as self-expression, not just loyalty. For Lululemon, it’s proof that the brand once synonymous with quiet luxury in yoga studios now wants to dominate the loudest arenas in America.Lululemon’s NFL collection may look like simple branding, but it signals a culture shift: the convergence of wellness chic and sports spectacle. The next time someone cheers for the Cowboys, it might just be in Align leggings and a Scuba hoodie — proof that the end zone has officially met the Zen zone.","Lululemon has teamed up with the NFL and Fanatics to launch a new line of officially licensed apparel and accessories for all 32 teams.

Sugar crash: US candy retailer CandyWarehouse.com goes bankrupt weeks before Halloween,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sugar-crash-us-candy-retailer-candywarehouse-com-goes-bankrupt-weeks-before-halloween/articleshow/124874529.cms,"

What caused the sugar crash

A market shifting toward healthier treats

What the bankruptcy means for the company

A sign of larger trouble in sweets





Major US candy company CandyWarehouse.com, based in Sugar Land, Texas, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just one week before Halloween, the biggest candy selling day of the year. The filing, submitted on 24 October 2025 in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, revealed the retailer’s grim financial standing: assets between US$100,000 and US$1 million set against liabilities of US$1 million to US$10 million, confirmation that the company could no longer meet its debts.Founded in 1998, the retailer grew into a major force in the online confectionery business, offering a vast selection of fresh, high quality sweets sold in bulk to both individual shoppers and businesses such as hotels, hospitals and restaurants. But despite decades of steady demand, CandyWarehouse.com has been hit from all sides by financial pressures and fast changing consumer behaviour.Online sales have suffered a notable downturn, with the business seeing a 10 to 20 per cent drop in 2024 and projections suggesting an even sharper decline up to 50 per cent in 2025. The market is increasingly favouring healthier choices, low sugar sweets and functional treats, leaving traditional candy retailers fighting for relevance.At the same time, rising shop prices and shrinking pack sizes have made consumers more selective and more cautious with their spending.One of the most significant burdens on the confectionery industry has been soaring cocoa prices. In 2024, global cocoa costs surged by 178 per cent after weather related crop failures in key producing nations like Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Although prices stabilised somewhat in 2025, manufacturers had already committed to purchasing ingredients at far higher levels, leading to sustained cost pressures.

With inputs from agencies





Amazon has begun one of the largest corporate layoffs in its history, planning to cut as many as 30,000 white-collar jobs this week. What began as a pandemic-era hiring spree has turned into a cold recalibration — one that reveals not just the state of the economy, but the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence.According to a Reuters report, the layoffs will affect several major divisions: People Experience and Technology (PXT) — Amazon’s vast human resources arm — along with devices, operations, services, and even AWS, the company’s most profitable cloud unit. Managers were instructed on Monday on how to deliver the news to affected teams, with email notifications beginning Tuesday morning.The number — roughly 10% of Amazon’s corporate staff — could still fluctuate, depending on future financial priorities. The cuts come as part of CEO Andy Jassy ’s ongoing “efficiency” campaign, aimed at flattening management layers, reducing internal red tape, and pushing AI deeper into Amazon’s day-to-day operations.This is not simply another layoff cycle. It’s a restructuring of the modern corporate hierarchy. Jassy has made no secret of his intent to let AI tools handle routine decision-making and analysis once managed by middle managers. Earlier this year, he said AI adoption would “inevitably” replace many repetitive or process-heavy roles.Amazon’s internal complaint hotline — created to identify inefficiencies — has already generated 1,500 suggestions and over 450 changes.Combined with the rollout of generative AI systems across customer service, HR, and logistics, the company has reached a point where software is not just assisting management — it’s replacing it.Sky Canaves, an eMarketer analyst, put it bluntly: “Amazon is likely realising enough AI-driven productivity gains within corporate teams to support a substantial reduction in force.”Beth Galetti, Amazon’s Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology, acknowledged the layoffs in a memo posted on the company’s website. She framed the cuts as part of a long-term push to make Amazon “the world’s largest startup,” focused on speed, ownership, and innovation. “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Galetti wrote. “The world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before. We’re convinced that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”Her note also confirmed that Amazon will offer affected employees 90 days to find internal roles and provide severance pay, outplacement services, and health benefits to those who leave. While Galetti emphasised that Amazon will continue hiring in “key strategic areas,” she underscored that efficiency and agility — not headcount — will define the company’s next chapter.Jassy’s move mirrors a growing trend in Big Tech — using AI not only to cut costs but to justify a cultural reset. By automating workflows and introducing AI into corporate planning and operations, Amazon is creating a leaner model where humans supervise machines that supervise other humans.Jassy’s internal message has been consistent: bureaucracy kills innovation. By reducing managerial layers, he hopes to accelerate decision-making and product development. The irony, of course, is that this anti-bureaucracy campaign is being enforced through one of the most bureaucratic processes in the corporate world — mass layoffs.Amazon’s strict five-day return-to-office policy — one of the toughest in the tech industry — has also failed to push enough employees to leave voluntarily. As a result, some who continue to work remotely have reportedly been told they have “voluntarily quit” and are ineligible for severance. It’s a cost-saving mechanism disguised as corporate discipline.While AWS remains Amazon’s biggest profit engine, its growth has slowed. The cloud division reported $30.9 billion in second-quarter revenue — up 17.5%, but lagging far behind Microsoft Azure’s 39% and Google Cloud’s 32%. Analysts see the layoffs as an attempt to preserve margins and reinvest in AI infrastructure amid slowing sales and a recent 15-hour AWS outage that disrupted major online services.Amazon is still hiring at the bottom of the pyramid. The company plans to bring on 250,000 seasonal warehouse workers for the holiday season — the same as last year. The contrast is stark: while machines replace white-collar roles, human labour continues to fill temporary, low-paid physical ones. It’s a snapshot of a new class divide in the tech economy — AI engineers and seasonal staff, with less and less in between.Amazon’s restructuring follows a familiar pattern across Silicon Valley. Meta’s “Year of Efficiency,” Google’s “AI-first” realignment, and Microsoft’s “copilotification” of the workplace have all led to layoffs framed as innovation strategy rather than failure. In Amazon’s case, however, this shift is deeply personal for Jassy, who spent years building AWS into a behemoth before taking the CEO role in 2021. His challenge now is to prove that Amazon can remain agile, profitable, and innovative without the pandemic-era workforce that fuelled its boom.There’s also a psychological shift underway. When Amazon laid off 27,000 workers in 2022, it was framed as post-COVID normalisation. This round feels different — not reactive, but philosophical. It’s about redefining what “efficiency” means in a world where AI has become the new middle management.For Amazon, these 30,000 cuts are less about financial strain and more about future-proofing the corporation. Jassy’s message is clear: if a process can be automated, it will be. If a human role adds friction, it’s expendable. What we’re witnessing is a turning point — where the world’s most powerful retailer begins its transformation into an AI-driven enterprise. The layoffs may look like a corporate correction, but they’re also a quiet declaration: in the new Amazon, efficiency is the product.","Amazon has begun one of the largest corporate layoffs in its history, planning to cut as many as 30,000 white-collar jobs this week.

"Trouble in the North Sea? Petrofac files for administration amid debt crisis; 2,000 jobs at risk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trouble-in-the-north-sea-petrofac-files-for-administration-amid-debt-crisis-2000-jobs-at-risk/articleshow/124872045.cms,"Representative image (AP)





Approximately 2,000 jobs are at risk after Petrofac, one of the largest oil and gas contractors in the North Sea, filed for administration.According to a report by Guardian, the company said it has approached the High Court of England and Wales to appoint administrators after losing a key offshore wind contract, which did not meet its obligations.Petrofac, which employs approximately 7,300 people worldwide, said the administration process is expected to be handled by business advisory firm Teneo and applies only to its parent holding company. The company added that it will continue normal operations during the process.Petrofac has spent more than a year trying to resolve its financial woes, with a court-approved restructuring plan cleared in May. The company is burdened with debt that could be as high as $4 billion (£3 billion), according to a court ruling from July in a case brought by some of its creditors.The oilfield services firm has been struggling for years, starting with a 2017 investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office, which led to a conviction in 2021 for failing to prevent bribery and fines of over $100 million. The scandal made it more difficult for Petrofac to win new contracts.Although the company briefly managed to recover, the pandemic, which hit soon after, worsened its financial troubles.The company told investors on Thursday that it could no longer continue with a solvent restructuring after its largest customer, European electricity grid operator TenneT, canceled a crucial contract to build offshore wind projects off the Dutch coast.“Having carefully assessed the impact of TenneT’s decision, the board has determined that the restructuring, which last week reached an advanced stage, is no longer deliverable in its current form,"" the company said, as cited by the Guardian.","Petrofac, one of the largest oil and gas contractors in the North Sea, filed for administration.

The local response



Food banks under strain



The economic ripple effect

Who’s most vulnerable?

Bottom line:





In a few days, millions of American families could find their cupboards bare. As the government shutdown drags on, food stamp payments are set to stop from 1 November, cutting off a vital lifeline for 42 million people and exposing how close hunger lies beneath the surface of the world’s richest nation.More than 42 million Americans rely on food stamps, monthly payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP), to help them afford groceries. Those benefits are due to stop on 1 November if the ongoing US government shutdown continues, raising fears of widespread hunger and economic disruption.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed that it will run out of money to fund SNAP next month, saying in a memo: “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.” The USDA said that “the well has run dry” and that contingency funds cannot legally be used for regular SNAP payments, as they are reserved for disaster relief. This means about $8 billion in monthly food aid will suddenly stop, affecting one in eight Americans.SNAP is often the last line of defence against hunger. For many families, it is not just a supplement but the main source of money for food. With bills, rent and prices already high, millions could be forced to choose between paying for essentials and putting meals on the table.In Maine, single mother Kasey McBlais said she plans to delay paying her electricity and credit card bills to ensure her children can eat: “My children won’t go hungry, but we’ll have to choose which bills can wait.”In Massachusetts, mother of four Sharlene Sutton, who recently left work to care for her epileptic child, said: “I’m not worried about myself, it’s about the kids. Where am I going to get food from?”Some states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have pledged to continue SNAP payments temporarily. New York has promised $30 million in emergency food aid and additional support for food banks.However, the USDA has warned that states will not be reimbursed, raising doubts about how long these measures can continue.Charities say they cannot replace the federal programme. “The charitable food system doesn’t have the resources to replace all those food dollars,” said John Sayles, head of the Vermont Foodbank. Food banks in states such as New Mexico are already seeing “panic” among residents. The Roadrunner Food Bank, which serves 83,000 households each week, expects demand to surge. Even before this crisis, food banks were under pressure from rising prices and funding cuts, including the cancellation of a $420 million federal programme that helped them buy food directly from local farmers.SNAP payments also support local economies. Experts estimate that each dollar in food aid generates about $1.60 in local spending, helping sustain small grocers, rural shops and local producers. “SNAP is the foundation of economic support for many food retailers,” said Kate Bauer of the University of Michigan. “The impact will ripple far beyond the households receiving aid.”Roughly two-thirds of SNAP recipients are children, older adults or people with disabilities, according to the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities. For families living from one paycheque to the next, even a short disruption could have immediate and painful consequencesIf Washington fails to end the shutdown, America’s most vulnerable families could go hungry within days. The effects will reach far beyond the dinner table.","$8 billion in monthly food aid will suddenly stop, affecting one in eight Americans.

Russian petroleum giant Lukoil announced on Monday evening that it will divest its international operations following US sanctions imposed in connection with Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.“Owing to the introduction of restrictive measures against the company and its subsidiaries by some states, the company announces its intention to sell its international assets,” Lukoil said in a statement, as quoted by AFP, adding that the sale process has already begun.The Trump administration last week rolled out its first major sanctions against Russia, targeting Lukoil and Rosneft , citing the country’s ongoing military operations against Ukraine.The sanctions freeze all US-based assets of Rosneft and Lukoil and bar American firms from doing business with them. Together, the two companies account for around 55 per cent of Russia’s petroleum production and have been added to the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list, which many countries and corporations follow.Washington has given companies till November 21 (approx 30 days) to sever ties with the sanctioned entities or risk secondary sanctions, which could restrict access to American banking, trade, shipping and insurance services.Despite several diplomatic efforts this year — including the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in over three years — peace negotiations remain stalled. President Trump cancelled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin before implementing the sanctions. Putin termed the measures “serious” but said they would not cripple Russia’s economy, already under multiple restrictions, becoming the most sanctioned nation in the world.","The Trump administration last week rolled out its first major sanctions against Russia.

America First Or America Alone? Ex-US Secretary Slams Donald Trump For Jeopardising India Alliance





Former US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo has criticised President Donald Trump’s foreign and trade policies, warning that Washington is “making a big mistake with India” and alienating key global allies through an isolationist approach.Speaking at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics during a conversation, named ‘Industrial Policy and Economic Security,’ with former treasury secretary Lawrence Summers, Raimondo said the Trump administration’s “America First” strategy had weakened US global influence and eroded long-standing partnerships.“We’re making a big mistake with India. The Trump administration has pissed off all our allies. America First is one thing. America Alone is a disastrous policy,” Raimondo said.The former Biden administration official argued that America’s current posture risked undermining crucial economic and strategic relationships.“On my list of top 20 things that I would be critical of this administration for is pissing off all of our allies,” she said. “An America that’s not a good friend or partner or ally to Europe, to Japan, is a weak America,” she said.Her remarks come amid rising trade tensions between Washington and New Delhi, after the Trump administration doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50 per cent, imposing new duties earlier this year over India’s continued purchase of Russian crude oil, despite repeated US objections.Raimondo urged a recalibration of US diplomacy, stressing that effective global engagement required cooperation, not unilateralism. “I don’t think we can be effective without strong relationships with Europe or much of Southeast Asia,” she added.“And I wish that we would have much stronger commercial relationships with Europe. I think we’re making a big mistake with India,” she said.She also cautioned against what she called American “hubris” in dealing with partners, warning that other nations would not wait for Washington to rebuild ties. “What we’re doing right now is giving the Heisman to the rest of the world,” she said.“If we think they’re going to sit around and wait for us to come back, I worry they won’t. China is right there every day in Europe, in Africa, in Latin America, in Southeast Asia. It’s such hubris by America to say we’re the only ones,” she went on to say.Raimondo further voiced disagreement with both Trump and Joe Biden on the idea of reshoring all manufacturing, saying, “I don’t agree with the idea that we should make everything in America. We don’t have enough labour, it’s not where we have an advantage, and it’s not critical to our national security.”","Former commerce secretary Gina Raimondo has criticised President Donald Trump’s foreign and trade policies.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

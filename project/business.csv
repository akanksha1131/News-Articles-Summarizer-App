Platform metrics show strong traction

SoftBank-backed e-commerce firm Meesho will open its initial public offering on December 3, featuring a Rs 4,250-crore fresh issue of shares, according to the red herring prospectus filed on Thursday. The issue will close on December 5, while anchor investors will be allotted shares on December 2, PTI reported.Alongside the fresh issue, the IPO will include an offer-for-sale of 10.55 crore shares by existing investors. Early backers such as Elevation, Peak XV, Venture Highway and Y Combinator will offload part of their holdings through the OFS.Meesho said the funds raised will be deployed for cloud infrastructure investments, marketing and brand-building initiatives, inorganic expansion through acquisitions and other strategic plans, and general corporate purposes. The size of the issue and the company’s valuation will depend on the price band, which will be released on Friday.In FY25, Meesho connected more than 500,000 transacting sellers with 199 million annual transacting users, enabling 1.8 billion placed orders. The company’s Net Merchandise Value (NMV) rose 29 per cent year-on-year to Rs 29,988 crore in FY25, after growing 21 per cent in FY24.Meesho defines NMV as the cumulative checkout value of successfully delivered orders, including taxes. The metric is a key gauge of platform health as it reflects user adoption and repeat engagement, making it central to revenue, margin and cash-flow trends.On the financial front, Meesho reported a net loss of Rs 3,942 crore in FY25, driven largely by one-time exceptional items, including reverse flip tax and perquisite tax linked to its transition to a public structure.","SoftBank-backed e-commerce firm Meesho will open its initial public offering on December 3.

Implementation of the new labour codes is expected to deliver a Rs 75,000-crore consumption boost and raise the share of the formal workforce by at least 15 per cent, according to a research note by economists at SBI on Tuesday.The four codes, enforced from November 21, will also expand social security coverage to up to 85 per cent within the next three years and help reduce the unemployment rate by 1.3 per cent over the medium term, the note said, PTI reported.“With a saving rate of approx 30 per cent, the implementation will result in a consumption boost Rs 66 per person per day post-implementation. This could lead to an approx consumption boost of Rs 75,000 crore,” the SBI economists said.They added that the new framework will empower both workers and enterprises, creating a labour market that is “protected, productive and aligned with the evolving world of work.”SBI economists said India has around 44 crore unorganised workers, of whom 31 crore are registered on the e-Shram portal.Assuming 20 per cent of these workers transition into the formal payroll system, nearly 10 crore people would benefit — pushing social security coverage to 80–85 per cent in the next two to three years.Citing the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the note said 60.4 per cent of India’s workforce is currently formal. The bank expects formalisation to rise by 15.1 per cent under the new regime.The impact on unemployment will depend on “reform implementation, firm-level adjustment costs, and complementary state-level rules,” the report said.","The four codes, enforced from November 21, will expand social security coverage to up to 85 per cent within the next three years.

Benchmark indices advanced for the third straight week, with the Nifty hitting a new all-time high of 26,310 during Thursday’s session. The rally was fueled by positive global cues and rising expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Market sentiment further improved as crude oil prices eased on renewed optimism about a potential Ukraine–Russia peace agreement. Additionally, a lower India CPI inflation print boosted hopes of an RBI rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy review.A key point to note is that the index showed a much faster recovery this week, erasing the entire three-day decline in just one session and reinforcing the bullish momentum. Strong buying interest in heavyweight large-cap stocks fueled a sharp rebound, with market leadership clearly shifting toward major heavyweights.Going ahead we expect the index to maintain overall positive bias and gradually head towards 26,500 and then towards 26,800 levels in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the recent range breakout (26,100-25,400). The two-month uptrend has remained well within a rising channel, indicating sustained demand even at higher levels and reinforcing the positive bias for the index.The channel’s upper band also aligns near the 26,800 marks.Short-term support is positioned in the 25,800–25,700 zone, which aligns with the confluence of the 20- and 50-day EMAs, the lower band of the two-month rising channel, and the recent two-week lows. This makes it an important level to monitor from a short-term perspective, sustaining above the same will keep the bias positive.While the Nifty and Nifty Midcap indices have already touched new all-time highs, the Small Cap index remains about 9% below its peak. We expect a gradual catch-up in the small-cap segment in the coming weeks, supported by emerging buying interest near the 52-week EMA in the Nifty small cap index.Key Monitorables for the short term:Bank Nifty extended its rally for the fourth week in a row as it rallied to a fresh all time high of 59866 levels in Thursday session.The index rebounded in Wednesday session from the upper band of the recent range breakout area and closed firmly above the 59,500 levels. The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels.We expect the index to retain its positive momentum and move towards the 60,400 level in the coming sessions, based on the measuring implication of the recent range breakout. A move above that will open further upside towards 61,000 levels in the coming weeks Meanwhile, the 58,500 is likely to act as a crucial support area, with the previous resistance now expected to serve as support.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a bullish crossover above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias.The stock is witnessing buying demand after a base at the 100 days EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the previous up move (1022-1223) signaling strength.We expect the stock to move higher and head towards 1240 levels in the coming month being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline (1223-1104).The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias in the stock.The stock is rebounding from the support area of 480-470 being the confluence of the previous major lows and the trendline support joining the lows of October 2024 and February 2025,We expect the stock to resume up move and head towards 535 levels in the coming month being the 80% retracement of the recent breather (557-474)The daily stochastic has rebounded from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal thus supporting the positive bias in the stock.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 28, 2025 are JSW Steel, and JSW Energy.

Banking Connect: NPCI Bharat BillPay launches new system for online payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/net-banking-upgrade-rbi-gets-real-time-view-via-new-platform-tighter-oversight-on-risky-sectors/articleshow/125615997.cms,"Big push to expand digital bill-payments

Banking Connect- the newly launched net-banking platform built by NPCI Bharat BillPay (NBBL) - will enable the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to monitor fund transfers in shorter-lag, a senior official said on Thursday.NBBL is aiming for a fourfold jump in monthly bill-payment volumes to 1 billion transactions in four years, up from the current 260 million, managing director and CEO Noopur Chaturvedi told reporters, according to PTI.Chaturvedi said a live, instantaneous view of transfers routed through Banking Connect will significantly strengthen regulatory oversight. “A shoter-lag view of transactions will help the RBI monitor fund flows to sectors such as cryptocurrency and gaming,” she said.At present, banks send net-banking transaction data to the RBI with a lag — typically a week, and in some cases up to a year, she said. The regulator has consistently flagged concerns around private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and the government has tightened rules around money gaming.The new platform is also designed to minimise fraud by flagging suspect transactions faster. However, social-engineering scams - where customers are tricked into sharing sensitive information - remain difficult to contain, she added.Banking Connect aims to fix gaps in existing payment systems, especially since net banking is still used predominantly for merchant payments. The platform supports interoperability and follows a mobile-first design.Six banks and several payment aggregators have already joined, with efforts underway to onboard the top five banks by net-banking volumes within a month.Created by NBBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of NPCI, the platform went live last month. Currently, around 80 million customers use net banking, executing nearly 300 transactions a month, with monthly value exceeding Rs 6 lakh crore.While UPI continues to grow at a rapid clip, net-banking usage has been expanding at single-digit rates, Chaturvedi said.NBBL now wants to lift household adoption of digital bill-payments significantly. “About 70 million households are using the facility today. We are targeting over 135 million - roughly half of all Indian households,” she said.","NBBL is aiming for a fourfold jump in monthly bill-payment volumes to 1 billion transactions in four years.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold futures on MCX traded steady near ₹1,25,540, consolidating within a tight range after recent sessions of sideways movement. Despite low volatility, the underlying technical structure continues to suggest a bullish bias, as short-term momentum remains supported by the moving averages. The setup indicates a buy-on-dips opportunity near ₹1,25,500, with the bias staying positive above ₹1,25,350.The 8 EMA continues to hover slightly above the 21 EMA, maintaining a mildly bullish crossover that supports buying on declines. A sustained move above ₹1,25,850 could trigger fresh upside momentum toward higher resistance levels.Gold prices are trading close to the mid-Bollinger band, suggesting a consolidation phase. The lower band, placed near ₹1,25,400–₹1,25,500, serves as strong intraday support where fresh buying interest is likely to emerge.The RSI is currently around 47, reflecting neutral momentum but with scope for recovery. A move above 50 on the RSI scale would reinforce a bullish continuation.The MACD line remains close to the signal line, showing a potential for upward crossover as consolidation continues. This suggests that momentum could build once price sustains above ₹1,25,850.Gold’s intraday technical setup reflects a steady bullish bias, supported by short-term moving averages and a potential MACD crossover. With the RSI stabilizing near mid-range and Bollinger Band support intact, traders are advised to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy around ₹1,25,500, keeping a stop-loss below ₹1,25,250 and targeting ₹1,25,850–₹1,26,200. Sustained trade above the upper band may further extend gains toward ₹1,26,450 in the near term.","Gold prices are exhibiting a bullish bias, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 was above 26,200, BSE Sensex was near 85,750. At 9:27 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,219.45, up 4 points or 0.015%. BSE Sensex was at 85,750.14, up 30 points or 0.035%.Technical analysts indicate 26,300 as crucial resistance and breakout point. A definitive close above this threshold could potentially lead to new peaks in the 26,350–26,450 range.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The important takeaway from the new records set by Nifty and Sensex yesterday is that these are new records driven by a narrow rally in a limited number of performing largecaps. Despite the market at new highs, majority of retail investors, particularly the newbies who rushed into the market after the Covid crash in March 2020, are holding portfolios which show losses. This paradox is due to the retail investors’ obsession with smallcaps and their belief that smallcaps will outperform irrespective of their valuation. If retail investors have to participate in the rally expected in 2026, to be driven primarily by higher earnings growth, they will have to invest in largecaps and quality midcaps with growth potential.“Even though Sensex and Nifty touched new highs yesterday, the Nifty Smallcap Index is around 9 % below its peak. This huge underperformance is primarily due to the poor earnings growth and high valuations of this segment. Smallcaps, in general, are likely to continue underperforming, in the short- to medium-term.”Brent crude remained steady on Friday whilst market participants observed Russia-Ukraine peace talks developments and anticipated Sunday's OPEC+ meeting results regarding future supply adjustments that have been affecting market conditions.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 1,255 crore net on Wednesday.

Cyber security rules: DoT withdraws duplicate notification; original telecom security amendments stay in force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cybersecurity/cyber-rules-dot-withdraws-duplicate-notification-original-telecom-security-amendments-stay-in-force/articleshow/125616390.cms,"Cyber fraud crackdown at core of amended rules

Stronger data-sharing norms to track telecom-linked fraud

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on Thursday withdrew a duplicate Gazette notification issued last month, clarifying that the amended Telecommunication Cyber Security (TCS) Rules, 2025 - notified on October 22 - remain fully in force.The clarification came after the same TCS amendment notification was inadvertently republished on October 29 in place of a different rule meant for public consultation. The error was rescinded through notification GSR 863(E) on November 25, PTI reported.“This error now stands rectified… and this rescindment in no way invalidates the original amendment to TCS Rule that brought it into effect in the first place,” the DoT said in a statement.The amended TCS framework targets rising cyber vulnerabilities stemming from the deep integration of telecom identifiers — mobile numbers, devices, and other telecom resources — into digital services such as banking, e-commerce and e-governance.A key measure is the creation of a Mobile Number Validation (MNV) platform aimed at curbing the surge in mule accounts and identity fraud. The decentralised, privacy-compliant mechanism will allow service providers to verify whether a mobile number genuinely belongs to the person whose credentials are on record, strengthening trust in digital transactions.The updated rules also tighten scrutiny of the booming second-hand device market. Entities dealing in resale or refurbished devices must scrub every handset’s IMEI against a centralised blacklist before resale — a move intended to counter the circulation of cloned, stolen or blacklisted phones and protect consumers from legal exposure.Under the amended TCS rules, banks, e-commerce platforms and other telecom identifier user entities may be required to share relevant telecom-identifier data with the government under regulated conditions. The DoT said this is aimed at improving traceability, accountability and coordination in combating telecom-enabled cyber fraud, while maintaining compliance with data protection norms.According to the department, the amendments collectively seek to “safeguard India’s digital ecosystem against telecom-enabled frauds, strengthen device traceability, and ensure responsible use of telecom identifiers.” The TCS Amendment Rules, 2025, it added, mark a “decisive step” toward a more resilient and future-ready telecom cyber security framework.","The amended Telecommunication Cyber Security (TCS) Rules, 2025 - notified on October 22 - remain fully in force.

India’s engineering goods exports fell a steep 16.71 per cent year-on-year in October 2025 to $9.37 billion, primarily due to a sharp drop in shipments to the US and a high base effect, the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India (EEPC) said on Saturday.Exports to key markets recorded widespread declines, with the Asean region seeing an almost 50 per cent fall to $1.02 billion.The US remained India’s top destination for engineering goods, but shipments dropped 14.5 per cent to $1.39 billion in October 2025, compared with $1.63 billion a year earlier.The decline was driven by the combined impact of Section 232 tariffs and reciprocal tariffs, EEPC said.Exports to the UAE fell 19.3 per cent to $667 million, while North America and the EU — the top two regions — also witnessed year-on-year declines for the second consecutive month. Significant drops were noted across WANA, South Asia, Latin America and the CIS region.“While a high base effect was one of the reasons for the drop in exports during October this year, it was also a result of the US-administered reciprocal tariffs… The industry believes that trade diversion due to US tariffs is one of the reasons behind the declining exports,” EEPC Chairman Pankaj Chadha said.He added that the industry welcomed the government approving over Rs 25,000 crore for the Export Promotion Mission and Rs 20,000 crore for credit guarantee support.The fall in October marked the second monthly decline of FY26 after May, ending a four-month streak of growth.Panel-wise data showed major contractions in ‘Aircrafts and Spacecraft’ and ‘Ships, Boats and Floating structures’, both falling over 80 per cent.Key categories including ‘Electrical machinery’, ‘Products of iron and steel’, ‘Industrial machinery’ and ‘Aluminium products’ also registered year-on-year declines. Overall, 23 of 34 engineering panels recorded negative growth in October.India’s exports to the US have been under pressure for months due to steep tariff hikes.Between May and October 2025, US-bound shipments fell 28.5 per cent as American duties climbed from 10 per cent in April to 50 per cent by late August, as per a GTRI report.Labour-intensive goods, which faced 50 per cent tariffs, saw a 31.2 per cent drop in the same period.Despite the October setback, engineering exports grew 1.68 per cent on a cumulative basis during April-October 2025, rising to $68.73 billion from $67.60 billion a year earlier, ANI reported.",India’s engineering goods exports fell a steep 16.71 per cent year-on-year in October 2025 to $9.37 billion.

EAM Jaishankar Decodes Massive US China Power Shift And Global Realignment In Sharp Kolkata Address

External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said the world has entered an era where “politics increasingly trumps economics” and stressed that India must continuously diversify supply sources to safeguard national interests.The minister was speaking after receiving an Honorary Doctorate from IIM-Calcutta, reported PTI.“This is an era where politics increasingly trumps economics… and that is not a pun,” he said, adding that in an “uncertain world”, India must guarantee its needs by widening supply networks.He noted that the United States, “long the underwriter of the contemporary system”, has now set “radically new terms of engagement” by dealing with countries individually.He said China has “long played by its own rules” and continues to do so.Jaishankar highlighted that India and the US are currently engaged in two parallel negotiations — one on a framework trade deal focused on tariffs and another on a comprehensive agreement.His remarks come at a time when Indian exports to the US have seen a sharp 28.5 per cent decline between May and October 2025 due to aggressive tariff hikes, which pushed duties as high as 50 per cent by late August, as per a GTRI report.He said the global landscape is marked by fragmentation, supply insecurity and competing geopolitical pulls, with nations hedging against uncertainties.Jaishankar added that a third of global production “currently takes place in China”, putting the spotlight on supply-chain reliability. Conflicts and climate events have increased the risk of disruption.The minister asserted that India has been actively pursuing self-reliance and developing itself as a manufacturing base. He said the gap with successful Asian economies is narrowing with rapid progress in highways, railways, aviation, ports, energy and power. “We are now moving ahead, by any standards,” he said.Jaishankar emphasised that a major power like India must possess a strong industrial base, noting that ‘ Make in India ’ reflects a “different mindset and greater ambition”. He said industries must build domestic supply chains even as India seeks a stronger role in global ones.IIM-Calcutta, in its statement, said Jaishankar also reflected on the transformative impact of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, and underscored the need to strengthen domestic capabilities and reduce vulnerabilities.He reiterated that India’s foreign policy aims to expand the country’s global footprint as it works toward becoming a developed nation by 2047.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar said the world has entered an era where “politics increasingly trumps economics” He stressed that India must continuously diversify supply sources to safeguard national interests.

A history of dramatic and contested predictions

Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings after posting on X that “the biggest crash in history” has already begun. His message paints a picture of an economy under pressure from rapid technological change and widening global instability. Citing an AI-driven erosion of jobs and deepening stress in real estate markets, Kiyosaki argues that the financial landscape is shifting far faster than most expect, and that only those who prepare for a more turbulent era will be able to shield themselves from the heavy losses he believes lie ahead. In the latest post, he adds that the “best option” for investors is silver, while also urging them to consider gold during volatility.Kiyosaki’s latest message draws directly from his 2002 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, reprinted in 2013, where he predicted a historic market meltdown. His new post links the downturn to artificial intelligence, claiming job losses across the US, Europe and Asia are now triggering the market spiral he warned about more than two decades ago. He maintains that silver remains the “best option” for investors looking to protect themselves.Silver prices have continued climbing. As of 29 November 2025, the metal sits at about $56.70 per ounce, a 13 percent increase from the $50 level Kiyosaki referenced on 23 November. Yet major market indicators tell a more measured story. The S&P 500 has dipped roughly 5 percent from recent highs, suggesting turbulence but not the total global crash Kiyosaki describes.Kiyosaki has made bold crash forecasts repeatedly, including several in 2025 that did not unfold as predicted. His latest warning has sparked scepticism and online pushback, with figures like Grant Cardone publicly dismissing the claims. Still, the post taps into a broader and unresolved debate over AI’s economic impact and whether today’s volatility is a temporary shock or the beginning of something far more severe.","Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings.

India-Russia Summit Dates Out As PM Modi, Putin Review S-400, Su-57 And Global Security Challenges

Oil India Limited (OIL) launched a landmark offshore drilling campaign in the Kerala-Konkan basin by spudding its first deepwater well, Union petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Puri announced on Saturday.He described the development as an “inspirational stride” in India’s energy journey aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision.The frontier Category-III basin is considered to hold significant potential, and the planned 6,000-metre-deep well—located 20 nautical miles offshore—will be among the deepest offshore wells drilled in Indian waters. Highlighting the groundwork already completed, Puri said on X that over 1,028 sq km of 3D seismic data had been acquired, and the campaign would “probe key Cretaceous plays and strengthen India’s pursuit of new energy frontiers. ”India currently imports 80 per cent of its oil and 50 per cent of its natural gas needs, as per ANI.To reduce dependence, the government has been expanding sourcing from multiple countries while simultaneously ramping up domestic exploration.A major push is underway in the Andaman region, where Puri earlier said exploration activity was pointing to “good news”, suggesting the area could become India’s “Guyana moment”.Strengthening its deepwater capabilities, OIL recently signed a Technology Service Agreement with TotalEnergies in New Delhi to enhance collaboration in deep and ultra-deepwater exploration across Indian sedimentary basins.The agreement aims to leverage TotalEnergies’ global expertise across OIL’s current and future offshore portfolio, including stratigraphic wells mandated by the government.India has about 3.5 million sq km of sedimentary basins, but only eight per cent has been explored so far, leaving a vast offshore expanse untapped.","Oil India Limited (OIL) launched a landmark offshore drilling campaign in the Kerala-Konkan basin by spudding its first deepwater well.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has announced that investments made by Mutual Funds (MFs) and Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) will be treated as equity-related instruments from January 1, 2026.The move is aimed at encouraging greater participation in the REIT market, reported news agency ANI.Sebi said it had amended the Sebi (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to enable this shift in classification.In a circular issued on November 28, the regulator stated, “With effect from January 01, 2026, any investment made by Mutual Funds and SIFs in REITs shall be considered as an investment in equity-related instruments.”The regulator clarified that REITs will be eligible for inclusion in equity indices from July 1, 2026, allowing for a six-month transition period. Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), however, will continue to be categorised as hybrid instruments for MFs and SIFs.Sebi also said existing REIT investments held by debt schemes of Mutual Funds and SIF strategies as of December 31, 2025, will be “grandfathered,” ensuring current portfolios are not forced to comply with the new classification immediately.Grandfathering typically shields ongoing investments or policies from updated rules.Despite this protection, Sebi has encouraged Asset Management Companies (AMCs) to gradually divest REIT holdings from debt schemes, considering market liquidity and investor interests.The regulator said the changes have been introduced “to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market”.","Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) will be treated as equity- related instruments from January 1, 2026.

"EVs from last millennium, vehicles registered in 1900: Database anomalies set off clean-up drive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/evs-from-last-millennium-vehicles-registered-in-1900-database-anomalies-set-off-clean-up-drive/articleshow/125667358.cms,"NEW DELHI: Electric vehicles may have emerged as a class of vehicles in the wake of climate change concerns in the new millennium, but the Vahan registration database tells a different story — more than 1,500 EVs are recorded as manufactured and registered before 1996, long before such vehicles actually existed in India. There are also more than 70,000 vehicles with their year of registration marked as ‘1900’ and the unladen weight (load without occupant) of over eight crore vehicles is more than the laden weight (load with occupant).These are a few among 117 anomalies that National Informatics Centre (NIC) has found in Vahan datasets, primarily due to a legacy of decades of manual data keeping by local transport offices across states before the system moved online and lack of uniform validation mechanisms. NIC, which manages the national database of Vahan, mentioned these anomalies in the bid document it has floated to select a “system integrator for implementation of data quality and data management solution”. The document said the bidder should study and identify more anomalies (if any) and provide solutions.Sources said that there was now a huge focus on cleansing the database and streamlining it as robust and correct data on vehicles with details that include their age, make, fuel-type and category are key for planning and framing policies.While the agency to be engaged by NIC for three years will put in place a system for a “master data repository”, which would include cleansing, standardising and doing away with duplication of the legacy Vahan database, govt is also going to undertake a massive exercise to arrive at the exact number of vehicles that are operational or ‘live’.According to Vahan database, a little over 41 crore vehicles are registered in India, but even govt entities are unsure how many of these are actually in operation. The exercise is important amid concerns over the large number of older, fossil-fuel-powered vehicles contributing to air pollution in cities.Officials said there was a high possibility that many older vehicles were lying as scrap in junkyards or had been scrapped informally without updates being made in the registration system. So, the actual number of ‘live’ vehicles is likely to be significantly lower than the official numbers.TOI has learnt that the road transport ministry will soon roll out a framework to classify older vehicles under different categories. For example, non-renewal of registration for vehicles older than 15 years will see them being placed in the ‘permanent archive’ category, as they may not have been in use for years.Owners of vehicles with valid registrations but lacking PUC and insurance will get one year to update their documents and comply with regulatory norms. If they fail to do so, such vehicles would be moved to the temporary archive category. They will have a two-year window to ensure compliance with norms. Failure to do so may result in vehicles being placed in the permanent archive category, after which they will be removed from the Vahan system.“Most of the vehicles registered 20 or more years ago are not in operation, and these must be excluded from the database. But this should be done only after proper checks,” said transport expert Anil Chhikara.","More than 1,500 EVs are recorded as manufactured and registered before 1996.

The Indian rupee, which has been under persistent pressure through 2025, is unlikely to witness any sharp fall in the immediate term as its recent weakness has already played out, Union Bank of India said in a recent assessment.The bank noted that the currency has already slipped about 4 per cent this year and is currently stuck in a narrow band, weighed down by firm US dollar strength, capital outflows and uncertainty linked to the delayed first tranche of the India–US BTA.The rupee has been trading close to record lows, briefly touching 89.4950 in recent sessions, as foreign institutional investors have withdrawn over $14 billion since January, as per ANI.The bank said easing inflation and GST-related reforms were helping cushion some of the external strain. “Given that the rupee has already weakened by roughly 4 per cent this year, we do not expect significant further depreciation in the near term,” the report stated.It added that once clarity emerges on the trade agreement, “the appreciation threshold for the currency should shift”.Union Bank expects the rupee to remain range-bound between 88.80 and 89.50 through December, with strength likely only if there is sustained domestic equity inflow or “tangible progress” on the BTA, which could pull the currency toward 88.50 per dollar.If the pact is finalised alongside an RBI rate cut, improved FII sentiment and an anticipated US Fed easing cycle, the bank said the rupee could strengthen meaningfully. Any bearish turn, however, is expected to meet strong resistance near 89.50, with a breach opening the door to 89.90.Recently, the rupee settled at 89.45 on Friday, slipping 9 paise as a stronger greenback, firmer crude and weak equities dragged sentiment. Traders stayed cautious ahead of GDP data, which later showed the economy growing 8.2 per cent — the highest in six quarters.Forex analysts quoted by PTI said that month-end dollar demand and continued outflows were keeping the rupee pinned, even as the USD-INR pair faces resistance at 89.70 and finds support at 88.80.The rupee closed at 89.4575 in the latest session, just shy of its record low of 89.49 hit a week ago, with markets watching geopolitical developments, US tariffs and progress on the India–US deal for fresh direction.","The rupee has been trading close to record lows, briefly touching 89.4950 in recent sessions.

India Says US Trade Deal Is 'Only Matter Of Time' As Tariffs Reshape Bilateral Trade Negotiations

India’s exports to the United States saw a sharp 28.5% fall between May and October 2025 as aggressive tariff hikes by Washington hit key sectors.According to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), shipments dropped from $8.83 billion to $6.31 billion during the period, coinciding with US duties rising from 10% in April to 25% in early August and then to 50% by late August.GTRI said the sudden escalation made Indian goods among the most heavily taxed in the US market. By comparison, China faced tariffs of about 30%, while Japan’s stood near 15%.The think tank categorised exports into three segments. Tariff-exempt goods such as smartphones, pharmaceuticals and petroleum products accounted for 40.3% of October exports but still slipped 25.8%, falling from $3.42 billion in May to $2.54 billion.Uniform global tariff items — mainly iron, steel, aluminium, copper and auto parts — formed 7.6% of shipments and fell 23.8%, dropping from $629 million to $480 million.The steepest damage came in labour-intensive sectors such as gems and jewellery, solar panels, textiles, garments, chemicals and seafood, which alone faced the 50% rate.Exports in this group sank 31.2%, erasing nearly $1.5 billion.GTRI noted that even tariff-free categories could not escape the impact.Smartphone exports, India’s biggest product line to the US, plunged 36% from $2.29 billion in May to $1.50 billion in October.Monthly shipments tumbled sharply over the five months before showing a mild rebound in October. Pharmaceutical exports dipped 1.6%, while petroleum products fell 15.5%.The think tank said the fall in metals and auto parts was linked more to weak US industrial demand since tariff treatment was uniform for all suppliers.Against this backdrop, it urged the government to operationalise the Export Promotion Mission and push the US to remove an additional 25% Russia-related duty on Indian products.GTRI said the Mission — announced in March and approved on November 12 — “still exists only on paper,” arguing that delays in schemes and disbursals could undermine its goals.‘Nearly eight months into the fiscal year, no schemes are operational, while long-running programs such as the Market Access Initiative and the Interest Equalisation Scheme have made no payments this year,"" GTRI noted.The initiative has an outlay of Rs 25,060 crore for 2025–26 to 2030–31 and aims to support MSMEs, first-time exporters and labour-intensive sectors.The think tank said removing the extra tariff would halve the effective US burden to 25%, giving critical relief to Indian exporters.","India’s exports to the United States saw a sharp 28.5% fall between May and October 2025.

Tesla’s India Debut: Why Did Elon Musk Enter India & What Comes Next? | Explained

American electric carmaker Tesla is exploring ways to develop an electric-vehicle ecosystem in India to support long-term growth and enhance the ownership experience. Since beginning deliveries in September, the company has sold 109 vehicles and is now planning to establish home charging units, install superchargers in major cities, and set up chargers at key destinations such as malls and hotels.Tesla India General Manager Sharad Agarwal explained, “So the future roadmap will be to have a charging infrastructure to cover all major cities. We always build our infrastructure around the lifestyle of our customers, where they eat, where they work, where they go for staycations.”Agarwal highlighted the environmental benefits of EV adoption, noting that major cities like Delhi and Mumbai struggle with high pollution levels. “We have delivered more than 8 million cars worldwide, which has helped reduce carbon emissions by 32 million tons. So that's the kind of sustainable future we are talking about,” he said, stressing that air quality improvements are crucial to public health.On Tesla’s approach to sales, Agarwal said, “Our mission is to accelerate the world's transition towards sustainability. And when we are talking of this mission, we are also not only looking at the product, but also the way we sell to our customers, how we bring these products to our customers.”Unlike traditional car dealerships, Tesla follows a direct-to-consumer model.The Gurugram charging station, set to be commissioned soon, will be Tesla’s fourth in India, joining other stations equipped with 16 superchargers and 10 destination chargers. Tesla entered the Indian market earlier this year as its 50th global market and launched two imported Model Y variants priced at Rs 59.89 lakh and Rs 67.89 lakh. Both models are shipped from Shanghai and are subject to a 70% import duty, making them significantly more expensive than in the US.Tesla opened its first experience centre in Mumbai in July, followed by a second location at Aerocity, Delhi, in August. The company is taking a cautious approach in India due to high import duties and limited service infrastructure, and currently has no plans for local production.On the global front, Tesla delivered nearly 497,000 vehicles in the September quarter of 2025 and reported a 12% increase in revenue, reaching $28.1 billion.","The Gurugram charging station, set to be commissioned soon, will be Tesla’s fourth in India, joining other stations equipped with 16 superchargers and 10 destination chargers.

India Says US Trade Deal Is 'Only Matter Of Time' As Tariffs Reshape Bilateral Trade Negotiations

US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime, saying the duties had made the country “Rich, Strong, Powerful, and Safe,” in a post on his Truth Social account.Trump argued that because of the tariff framework he “set in place,” the United States now holds “all the cards,” asserting that the measures had stopped wars, strengthened alliances and prevented other nations from “ripping off the United States anymore.”He claimed the stock market and retirement savings had surged, adding that “Inflation, Prices and Taxes are down,” and that education was “being brought back to the States.”Trump also said the US military and southern border were “the strongest they have ever been,” contending that the country is “respected again, respected like never before.”He attributed these outcomes to what he described as “Strong leadership and tariffs.”The president’s remarks come at a sensitive moment, as the Supreme Court is preparing to rule on the extent of presidential authority to impose duties without congressional approval.Tariff revenues have climbed sharply in recent months, as per Fox Business, reaching a record $34.2 billion in October.Total duty collections were $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, and the Treasury has reported $41.6 billion in revenue so far in fiscal 2026.Since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, collections jumped from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, with August and September together bringing in $62.6 billion, reported Fox Business.US businesses pay these import taxes but often pass on the costs to consumers, though Trump has recently lifted some duties to ease price pressures.Trump has pledged that tariff revenues could finance a one-time $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income households.As per Fox Business, US trade representative Jamieson Greer recently said that the payments would not fuel inflation, stressing they would provide “welcome relief” without altering the broader economic outlook.Trump ended his post by urging Americans to “pray to God” that the Supreme Court “do the right thing for America.”","US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime.

Holiday rush: US retailers eye Black Friday lift; shoppers hunt deals despite weak sentiment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/holiday-rush-us-retailers-eye-black-friday-lift-shoppers-hunt-deals-despite-weak-sentiment/articleshow/125642803.cms,"Black Friday no longer pulls Americans from Thanksgiving dinners for midnight mall queues, but it still draws more in-store traffic than any other day of the year — and remains the unofficial start of the US holiday shopping season.This year’s kickoff came as US consumer confidence slipped following the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to The Conference Board, AP reported. Retailers say shoppers have grown more selective and deal-focused, even as they continue to spend on big seasonal moments, creating what executives describe as a “halo effect”.“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said ahead of Black Friday.At Macy’s Herald Square in New York City, early-morning crowds searched for steep discounts on shoes, clothing, linens and cosmetics after doors opened at 6 a.m. Footwear — marked down by 40–50% — was among the busiest sections. But unlike in past years, the atmosphere was calm.Veronica Nam, 68, picked up Nike sneakers for her husband and spent $256 on Lacoste bedding she estimated was half-price. She said she would wait until after Christmas to buy gifts for other relatives amid fluctuating tariffs under President Donald Trump and several years of elevated prices.“Food is very expensive,” she said.Nearby, 19-year-old Nicholas Menasche was shopping with his mother before heading to Best Buy for video games. The banking intern plans to spend around $1,200 this holiday season — roughly the same as last year. “I’m here to buy stuff. Shoes and clothes,” he said. “It’s a great tradition. The stores are open really early.”Retailers spent spring and summer navigating tariff unpredictability, shifting shipments ahead of import taxes and absorbing some costs to avoid raising prices. Circana data showed 40% of general merchandise in September saw price hikes of at least 5% versus early 2025. Toys, housewares, baby products and sports gear were especially affected; 83% of toys saw at least a 5% price rise. Nearly 80% of US toy sales involve items made in China — a sector hit with steep Trump-era tariffs.Still, malls and analysts reported strong momentum heading into Black Friday. At Minnesota’s Mall of America, foot traffic has exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels in recent weeks, said Jill Renslow, the mall’s chief business development and marketing officer. “We’re seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” she said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”Online spending is also growing briskly. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 23, consumers spent $79.7 billion, Adobe Analytics said — up 7.5% from a year earlier and ahead of its 5.3% forecast.Mastercard SpendingPulse projects holiday sales from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 will rise 3.6%, compared with last year’s 4.1%.“Clearly, there’s uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn’t seem like it’s changing how they are showing up for this season.”","Black Friday draws more in-store traffic than any other day of the year. Retailers say shoppers have grown more selective and deal-focused, even as they continue to spend on big seasonal moments.

Canada’s economy staged a stronger-than-expected recovery in the third quarter of 2025, expanding 2.6 per cent year-on-year after a contraction in the previous quarter, according to new data from Statistics Canada, AFP reported.The rebound was fuelled by an improved trade balance and higher government spending, offsetting the drag from US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has weighed on Canadian growth and clouded the country’s trade outlook.CIBC economist Katherine Judge said the print “was well above the consensus forecast,” noting that analysts had broadly expected growth of around 0.5 per cent.Statistics Canada said the improvement was led by declines in imports alongside a slight uptick in exports. “Imports dropped and exports edged up. Increased capital investment was driven by government capital spending, as business investment was flat,” the agency said.The drop in imports was the largest since 2022, the agency added.A sharp rise in federal outlays also contributed to the growth momentum, with government spending on weapons systems surging 82 per cent. Since taking office in March, Prime Minister Mark Carney has prioritised upgrading Canada’s ageing military hardware, arguing that significant investments are essential for meeting NATO spending targets and safeguarding sovereignty amid rising threats, including from Russia in the Arctic.","Canada's economy staged a stronger-than-expected recovery in the third quarter of 2025, expanding 2.6 per cent year-on-year.

German chemical major Wacker Chemie on Thursday announced plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce, as the industry faces one of its toughest periods in decades.The company said most of the reductions will take place in Germany, with the process to be completed by the end of 2027, according to AFP.The job cuts form part of a broader plan to save more than 300 million euros ($348 million) annually. Wacker employs around 16,600 people worldwide, most of them based in Germany. Its customer base spans the automotive, construction and semiconductor sectors — all of which have been hit by slowing demand and rising competition.Shares of Wacker Chemie rose nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt after the announcement.Chief executive Christian Hartel said the operating environment for chemical firms in Germany needed urgent improvement. “The excessively high energy prices and bureaucratic obstacles continue to act as a central brake on the successful development of the chemical industry,” he said.The company had reported a net loss of more than 80 million euros in the third quarter, citing weak demand and mounting competition, particularly from China.Earlier this month, Germany’s VCI chemical industry association warned that production in the sector had slipped to a three-decade low, reflecting the broader strain on traditional industries as the country struggles to emerge from two years of recession.","Wacker Chemie announces plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce.

Hong Kong Fire Out Of Control: Over 100 Casualties, Hundreds Missing; 3 Held For Manslaughter

China Taiping's insurance exposure



'Seriously underinsured'

China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project linked to a devastating high-rise fire that has killed at least 44 people and left hundreds missing.The stock slid as much as 8.1% in early trading before trimming losses to about 2% by late morning in Hong Kong. Firefighters continued battling the massive blaze on Thursday, nearly 18 hours after it tore through parts of the densely populated Wang Fuk Court estate in Tai Po.The disaster was the city's worst fire in decades, which erupted suddenly on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed several sections of the 32-storey complex, home to roughly 2,000 units.Authorities have arrested three men, saying flammable materials left behind during maintenance work had allowed the fire “to spread rapidly beyond control.”The buildings had been wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, a traditional but highly flammable material still widely used in Hong Kong.The fire began around 2:50 pm on Wednesday, with the estate under repair and wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, flames spread rapidly through the eight-building complex.The precise cause remains unknown, but officials believe leftover flammable material from maintenance work played a major role in the fire’s fast escalation. Rescue operations and investigations are ongoing.China Taiping underwrote third-party liability and employee compensation for mandatory building and window inspection work at the complex, Bloomberg reported.The HK$316 million (US$41 million) project, which used bamboo scaffolding and protective netting, is now part of an ongoing investigation into the cause of the disaster.The insurer’s policy covers the full contract sum plus an additional HK$50 million (US$6.4 million) for accidents, and provides HK$200 million in employee compensation. Separately, the company holds a general property-all-risk policy worth HK$2 billion.According to Bloomberg, Hong Kong Insurance Professionals Federation chairman Philip Mak said both the general all-risk policy and the construction-specific coverage are “seriously underinsured” given the scale of the multi-tower estate.Mak noted that rebuilding communal areas and replacing elevator steel cables will likely exceed the insured amounts. Individual flat owners may claim death or injury benefits under the HK$50 million accident portion, but he warned the sum is “nowhere near enough” in light of the number of deaths and the hundreds still unaccounted for.",China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project.

The factors influencing turkey prices this Thanksgiving

Grocery stores in the US are absorbing the rising cost of turkeys this Thanksgiving. A spike in bird flu cases has pushed up wholesale prices, according to new data from the US department of agriculture (USDA). But these higher costs are not being passed on to shoppers.USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year. Experts say stores are taking the hit to keep customers coming in, reported NBC News. Even the projected cost of a full Thanksgiving meal has stayed broadly steady.The main reason for the higher costs is a drop in supply. Bird flu has spread again among commercial poultry farms this autumn. By October, more than 2 million turkeys had been culled after exposure. Minnesota, the largest turkey-producing state, reported six confirmed outbreaks that month.David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told NBC, another virus avian metapneumovirus is also affecting production by reducing the number of viable eggs laid by hens. This has slowed farmers’ efforts to rebuild their flocks.Overall, turkey supply is tightening. The USDA expects production to fall to 4.8 million pounds this year, down from 5.1 million pounds in 2024.This shortage has pushed up costs for retailers. USDA data shows the wholesale price of frozen turkeys, the type most families buy for Thanksgiving, has jumped by about 80% since last year, rising from under $1 per pound to more than $1.70.A separate USDA report shows retail prices for frozen turkeys staying flat. Ortega said shops may be absorbing these increases to stop customers from switching stores. Retailers often use turkeys as a “loss leader”, selling them at or below cost to draw in shoppers and make up the difference through other items in their baskets.While turkey prices have stayed stable for shoppers, the overall cost of a Thanksgiving meal varies depending on the data source. Some estimates show prices rising by nearly 10%, while others show a fall of up to 5%.",USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year.

Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta all traded higher. Wellington and Manila lagged.This upswing comes after markets stumbled earlier in the month over fears that the tech-driven surge of recent years had overheated, and returns from heavy AI investments would take time to materialise. For now, those concerns have been overshadowed by the prospect of lower borrowing costs, which are seen as a bigger support for a broader range of companies, including smaller caps.Bitcoin, which had slumped to a seven-month low just above $80,000 during the recent market turmoil, climbed back above $90,000 as risk appetite improved.

AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers

Americans are set for a mix of family meals and early holiday shopping this week, with most big retailers staying shut on Thanksgiving before reopening at dawn for Black Friday, the unofficial start of the Christmas buying rush. The week also marks what AAA says will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record, according to AP report.Most national retailers — including Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Costco — will remain closed on Thursday, returning with early openings from 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Black Friday. CVS will shut early, and Walgreens will close most stores except select 24-hour locations. Grocery chains will open but many will close ahead of schedule, with timings varying by area.Government offices, post offices, courts and schools will be closed. US banks and stock markets will also shut for the day, reopening on Friday for a shortened trading session that ends at 1 p.m. Eastern. Standard FedEx and UPS pickup and delivery services will not operate on Thursday, though limited critical services will be available at certain locations.With schools closed and a long weekend ahead, travel is expected to surge.AAA estimates that 81.8 million people will journey at least 50 miles between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1 — 1.6 million more than last year and a potential new record. Nearly 73 million will travel by car, aided by petrol prices holding near $3 a gallon, slightly below last Thanksgiving’s average.About 6 million Americans are expected to fly domestically, a 2% rise from 2024, though cancellations or delays could shift the final count. Another 2.5 million travellers will rely on buses, trains or cruise ships, marking an 8.5% increase from last year.For many households, Thursday offers a quiet holiday — before the weekend turns into one of the year’s busiest on the roads, at airports and at shop entrances.","AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers.

Zoom in: Burry’s beef isn’t with Nvidia’s books-but its customers’



The big picture: A new bubble with a familiar face



What they're saying: Nvidia responds, Burry doubles down



What’s next



Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in “The Big Short,” is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir-two flagbearers of the AI rally. In a blistering Substack post, Burry dismissed Nvidia’s internal memo rebutting his concerns as “disingenuous on the face, and disappointing. ”He accused the world’s most valuable company of deflecting criticism with “one straw man after another,” charging that Nvidia’s response failed to engage with his actual concerns around depreciation assumptions in the AI ecosystem. The fresh attack comes as investors increasingly debate whether the AI boom has tipped into bubble territory, a Business Insider report said.The criticism comes at a critical moment: Nvidia stock has dropped 14% from its early-November peak, and broader questions are emerging over whether AI’s gold rush has entered speculative territory.Burry’s remarks tap into mounting investor unease-not about innovation, but about how profits are being propped up by accounting choices that may not age well as chip cycles shorten.Burry clarified that he never accused Nvidia of stretching out the depreciation of its own factories or equipment. “No one cares about Nvidia’s own depreciation,” he wrote. “One straw man burnt.”Instead, he zeroed in on cloud giants-Microsoft, Meta, Oracle-who are reportedly extending chip and server depreciation timelines from 3 years to 5 or 6.That, Burry says, lets them spread massive AI hardware costs over longer periods, inflating earnings now while kicking losses down the road.He cited a Microsoft interview in which Satya Nadella said the company slowed data center buildouts to avoid overbuilding for one generation of AI chips-a move Burry sees as confirmation that tech’s depreciation timelines may be out of sync with reality.“The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes,” Burry warned.Burry says today’s AI surge echoes the dot-com bubble-just with faster hardware, loftier assumptions, and bigger accounting risks. He compared Nvidia to Cisco circa 2000, the centerpiece of tech euphoria before the crash.“There is a Cisco at the center of it all,” he wrote. “Its name is Nvidia.”In a particularly stark forecast, Burry predicted tech companies could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, warning that Meta, Oracle and others could overstate earnings by 20–27% if timelines aren't adjusted.Nvidia disputed Burry’s math, especially around its stock buybacks. The company clarified that it has repurchased $91 billion in shares since 2018-not $112.5 billion as Burry implied-and said he mistakenly included RSU-related taxes.Nvidia also defended its GPU longevity, arguing chips like the A100 (released in 2020) are still in full use, justifying longer depreciation periods.Burry remains unmoved. “I stand by my analysis,” he posted on X. “Obviously, the full analysis does not fit in a tweet.”Burry disclosed he still holds put options on both Nvidia and Palantir, despite the market’s growing appetite for all things AI. He claimed they cost about $10 million each-not the $1.1 billion their notional value implied.He’s now using his new paywalled newsletter, “Cassandra Unchained,” to argue that this AI cycle isn’t just about tech-it’s also about the accounting scaffolding propping it up.“I have been drawn into something much bigger than me,” he wrote.If he’s right again, this won’t be the last straw man he sets alight.(With inputs from agencies)","Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in ‘The Big Short,’ is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir.

Explained: How China gained rare earths dominance — and what it means for the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-how-china-gained-rare-earths-dominance-and-what-it-means-for-the-us/articleshow/125588339.cms,"AI image

US Turns to India to Curb China’s Rare Earth Grip, Global Alliance to Counter Beijing’s Moves

Why the US fell behind





America and allies search for alternatives





China’s control over rare earth elements did not happen overnight. It is the result of decades of investment across every stage of the chain — from mining and reserves to processing and technology — giving Beijing significant influence in its trade dispute with Washington.These 17 minerals are essential for defence equipment such as fighter jets, radar systems and missile guidance, and are also used in smartphones, medical tools and cars.According to news agency AFP reporters who visited Ganzhou this month, found the heavy rare earths region buzzing with activity despite tight surveillance.The area produces elements like yttrium and terbium, and the agency reporters witnessed trucks moving in and out of mines and busy processing plants.The city is also constructing new headquarters for China Rare Earth Group, one of two major state-owned players formed after years of government-led consolidation.Economics lecturer Heron Lim told AFP that recent disruptions have encouraged more countries to consider expanding their own production, adding that such moves “could pay longer-term dividends.”Trade tensions push rare earths to centre stageChina’s export restrictions announced in early October shook global manufacturers and alarmed Washington, which is locked in a renewed trade war with Beijing under President Donald Trump’s second term.After talks in South Korea, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce that temporarily secures supplies of rare earths and other minerals — a development widely viewed as favourable to Beijing.Lim said rare earths would likely remain central to future negotiations, noting that China has shown it is prepared to use trade tools to keep the US engaged. He added that the uncertainty has created difficulties for industries dependent on these metals.During the Cold War, the United States led the rare earths industry, with the Mountain Pass mine in California supplying much of the world.But as relations with Moscow improved and environmental concerns grew, the US shifted production overseas through the 1980s and 1990s.China now accounts for about two-thirds of global mining and roughly 90% of processing, according to analysis cited by AFP. It also holds the world’s largest reserves and leads in patents, supported by strict export controls on processing technology.Commodities analyst Amelia Haines was quoted by AFP as saying that the heavy reliance on imports poses “significant risks to critical industries,” which could accelerate a broader push for mineral security.The US has been attempting for years to rebuild its rare earths capacity. Defence agencies have invested heavily to establish a full “mine-to-magnet” chain by 2027.Washington has also signed critical minerals agreements with allies including Australia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand.Trump recently announced an $8.5 billion rare earths partnership with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.This urgency is not new. In 2010, China briefly halted rare earth shipments to Japan during a territorial dispute, highlighting the geopolitical stakes.The Obama administration called for strengthening US resilience, yet 15 years on, China remains the dominant force in the sector.",China's control over rare earth elements did not happen overnight.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

"‘Not a good indicator, what counts is…’: India overtaking Japan to be 4th largest economy no reason to be smug; WEF ex-MD serves reality check",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/not-a-good-indicator-what-counts-is-india-overtaking-japan-to-be-4th-largest-economy-no-reason-to-be-smug-wef-ex-md-serves-reality-check/articleshow/121706941.cms,"For India to achieve its goal of becoming a $ 7-trillion economy by 2030, the country needs to strengthen its industrial sector, according to Smadja.

India overtaking Japan to become the fourth largest economy soon is not something to be complacent about, World Economic Forum’s (WEF) former MD Claude Smadja has said. Giving a reality check, Claude Smadja has pointed to India’s abysmal per capita GDP numbers, comparing them to how poorly they fare to Japan’s per capita income.India’s GDP ($4,187 billion) is set to surpass that of Japan ($4,186 billion) by the end of this year (FY26), according to the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report. However, the IMF statistics from April 2025 also reveal that India's GDP per capita stands at $2,878.4, which is roughly 8.5% of Japan's $33,955.7. This means that people in Japan earn approximately 11.8 times more than their Indian counterparts!""Yes, it (economy size) is a good indicator because it gives a notion of the economic weight of the country on the global balance. No, it is not a good indicator because what counts is the per capita GDP. In terms of per capita GDP, India is far below Japan. So whether India has achieved this fourth position in the global economic balance... is a good indicator of progress being made, but it is not in any way any reason for complacency,"" Smadja said in his conversation with PTI.In fact, Smadja emphasised that India's enhanced economic position should drive faster reforms, ensuring improved living conditions across all societal segments, beyond just the expanding middle class in both urban and rural regions.The youthful demographic of India remains a significant advantage, but Smadja highlighted the critical requirement to enhance skill development and retraining across the workforce.For India to achieve its goal of becoming a $ 7-trillion economy by 2030, the country needs to strengthen its industrial sector, according to Smadja.He pointed out that manufacturing's contribution to India's GDP is approximately half of China's level. He considers this proportion inadequate considering India's geographical size, population, and economic capabilities.Without substantial growth in manufacturing activities, India's aspirations to reach the $7-trillion economic milestone remain challenging, according to Smadja.Smadja, who heads Smadja and Smadja Strategic Advisory, spoke of India's crucial position in the global technology landscape. He noted the country's exceptional advantage in big data management, which he believes should be safeguarded and utilised effectively to elevate India's status in worldwide technology and innovation.Also Read | Extreme poverty in India sees sharp decline! Number dips from 344.47 million to 75.24 million; poverty rate down to 5.3%, says World Bank He emphasised that India ranks amongst the primary data producers globally, alongside China, Europe, and the US.According to him, India's unique circumstances stem from its widespread internet connectivity, extensive mobile phone usage, and the national ""Aadhaar"" identification system, resulting in substantial data generation that encompasses all aspects of everyday living.In India, safeguarding this vital strategic resource is crucial as it serves as the foundation for advancing technological innovation, fostering breakthroughs in disruptive technologies, and establishing itself amongst the world's leading big data powerhouses.Besides China, India stands alone in possessing such a substantial big data resource, according to Smadja.","India overtaking Japan to become the fourth largest economy soon is not something to be complacent about, World Economic Forum’s (WEF) former MD Claude Smadja has said.

Corporate Bonds: What's On Offer

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Bank fixed deposits lose sheen! Retail investors seeking enhanced returns from fixed-income portfolios are increasingly gravitating towards corporate bonds offering higher yields. This shift has intensified following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) reduction in repo rates by one percentage point since February, leading to decreased bank fixed deposit rates.These investors are focusing on state-guaranteed securities, NBFC bonds, and small finance and microfinance bonds, which provide superior returns compared to traditional bank deposits.State Bank of India's fixed deposits with 2-3 years tenure offer maximum returns of 6.7%, whilst state-guaranteed bonds from Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, with 2-4 years tenure, yield returns between 9-10%.Various retail websites offer these bonds with a minimum investment requirement of ₹10,000. These platforms, known as Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPP), are SEBI-registered entities facilitating electronic bond transactions, according to an ET report.Platforms such as Indiabonds, Bondbazaar, Grip Invest and Wint Wealth are experiencing increased trading activity.

If the rollout happens as planned, it would mark a major milestone in Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) program—a technology that has faced years of delays and criticism.Musk also revealed that the first Tesla to fully ""drive itself from the factory end of line all the way to a customer house is June 28.""Earlier, Musk responded to a video on X showing what appears to be one of Tesla's first robotaxis in Austin, a Model Y carrying a passenger with no driver behind the wheel.The car had a ""Robotaxi"" logo on its side.""These are unmodified Tesla cars coming straight from the factory, meaning that every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving!"" Musk wrote on X.Investors, analysts, and Tesla fans have been closely watching for this moment since Musk said earlier this year that the robotaxi service would launch in Austin sometime in June.In an interview with CNBC last month, Musk outlined initial plans for the service, stating that the vehicles would operate under remote supervision and ""geofenced"".He indicated plans to begin with approximately 10 vehicles, with rapid expansion planned for other metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Francisco.Musk has spent years promising fully self-driving Teslas “next year,” but now the pressure is real as the company begins rolling out its robotaxi service. Tesla's electric vehicle sales have recently dipped, hit by rising competition, the revamp of its popular Model Y, and the backlash from Musk’s political statements.The Austin launch coincides with a reported clash between Musk and US President Donald Trump over tax policy. Some analysts worry this could lead to more scrutiny from federal safety regulators if problems arise with the robotaxis.Still, Wall Street remains hopeful.

"Equity mutual fund inflows hit 13-month low; large, mid, small-caps all down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/equity-mutual-fund-inflows-hit-13-month-low-large-mid-small-caps-all-down/articleshow/121765268.cms,"MUMBAI: Equity mutual fund inflows fell to a 13-month low in May, with net additions dropping to Rs 19,013 crore, down 21.7% from April. This marked the fifth straight month of declining equity fund inflows, reflecting investor caution amid high valuations and global uncertainty.Despite the drop, retail participation through SIPs continued to rise. SIP inflows hit a record Rs 26,688 crore in May, marginally above April's Rs 26,632 crore. The number of contributing accounts rose to nearly 8.6 crore, with the total number of SIPs touching around 9.1 crore. At the same time, 59 lakh accounts were closed or matured, indicating turnover within the system.According to data released by industry body Amfi, total industry assets under management rose to Rs 72.2 lakh crore in May, up from Rs 70 lakh crore in April, supported by market performance. The Nifty 50 gained 1.7% in May, while mid-cap and small-cap indices rose 6.1% and 8.7%, respectively, helped by foreign portfolio investor flows and strong performance in sectors such as defence.Overall, the mutual fund industry experienced an infusion of over Rs 29,000 crore in May compared to Rs 2.77 lakh crore in the preceding month.However, inflows into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap funds all fell. Large-cap funds received Rs 1,250 crore, down from Rs 2,671 crore in April.Mid-cap fund inflows dropped to Rs 2,808 crore from Rs 3,313 crore, while small-cap funds attracted Rs 3,214 crore compared to Rs 3,999 crore earlier. Equity-linked saving schemes and value funds recorded net outflows of Rs 678 crore and Rs 92 crore, respectively.Flexi-cap funds attracted the highest equity inflows in May at Rs 3,841 crore. The shift reflects investor preference for more flexible strategies and caution around overvalued segments. Passive and hybrid fund categories also gained, pointing to diversification in investment approaches.Debt mutual funds saw a sharp reversal, with outflows of Rs 15,908 crore in May after Rs 2.2 lakh crore inflows in April. Redemptions came mainly from short-term categories, influenced by changing interest rate expectations and RBI's neutral stance.Corporate bond funds attracted Rs 11,980 crore, the highest since March 2023, as institutional investors chased higher yields in AA+ and above-rated paper. Bank liquidity and shorter maturities boosted demand.Foreign portfolio investors bought $2.3 billion worth of Indian shares in May, the highest since Sept 2024, contributing to equity market gains. Mutual funds, however, held Rs 2.15 trillion in cash in April, suggesting a wait-and-watch approach toward deployment.The rise in SIP inflows and accounts highlights steady retail commitment despite volatility. As digital adoption increases and mutual funds expand beyond larger cities, long-term structural participation appears stable. Yet, market volatility, high valuations, and geopolitical risks are likely to keep inflows uneven in the near term.","Net additions dropped to Rs 19,013 crore, down 21.7% from April.

The plan includes district-level outreach camps involving multiple agencies.The FSDC functions as the main platform for dialogue between the finance ministry and regulators. Tuesday's meeting was attended by RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra, Sebi chief Tuhin Kanta Pandey and ministry officials.These assets have grown due to outdated contact details, incomplete documentation, or unreported deaths. Unclaimed bank deposits reached Rs 78,213 crore as of March 2024, rising 26% from the previous year. RBI holds these balances under its Depositor Education and Awareness Fund. SBI alone accounts for over Rs 8,000 crore of this amount. Stockbrokers and other Sebi-regulated entities hold an additional Rs 500 crore in unclaimed assets, spread across idle funds and securities. Several demat accounts and mutual fund units remain inaccessible because of incomplete nominations or lack of awareness.Based on a review of cybersecurity rules, and suggestions from Financial Sector Assessment Programme 2024-25, the FSDC discussed creating a dedicated cybersecurity plan.This area has received emphasis in the wake of the surge in cyberattacks following the India-Pakistan conflict.The council also discussed expanding both the access and coverage of factoring services as well as the use of account aggregators which improves financial inclusion and can reduce unclaimed assets. It also discussed creating frameworks to assess and improve the responsiveness of regulations and proposed prescribing common KYC norms to enable digital onboarding, especially for NRIs, PIOs and OCIs in Indian markets.She said the asset recovery process must be simplified, especially for NRIs, PIOs, and OCIs.

"Modi at 11: Economy's good, but job creation, land & labour reforms need a push",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modi-at-11-economys-good-but-job-creation-land-labour-reforms-need-a-push/articleshow/121765680.cms,"There are two parameters that economists typically use to measure the economic performance of a country or any govt - growth rate and inflation.Going by GDP growth, the Indian economy expanded an average 6.8% during the UPA tenure, while averaging 6.2% between 2014-15 and 2024-25. But keeping 2020-21, when Covid resulted in economic contraction, and 2021-22, when the base effect resulted in a massive jump in growth, the average works out to 7.1%.On inflation too, the years of Modi govt have been better, averaging 8.1%, compared with 5% during the 10 years of Manmohan Singh (although based on different base years).While there is greater focus on managing food prices by ensuring improved supply and quicker responses, a big differentiator is crude oil, which has been kinder to Modi than Singh.On June 10, 2014, the Indian basket for refiners was $107 a barrel, translating into Rs 6,331 a barrel at the then exchange rate of Rs 59.26 to a dollar. Eleven years later, PPAC data for June pegs the Indian basket at $67.38 and at Tuesday's exchange rate of Rs 85.60 to a dollar, the cost works out to Rs 5,711 a barrel - almost 11% lower.""The economy delivered an average growth of 6.2% and an inflation rate of 5% over the last 11 years, despite the pandemic.The economy is currently in a healthy shape with inflation under control, corporates and banks having healthy balance sheets, a low current account deficit, and ample forex reserves. Rains and crude oil prices, which are luck factors, are expected to be favorable this year. We expect India's GDP to grow at 6.5% in fiscal 2026, with risks tilted to the downside due to weak global prospects amid heightened uncertainty,"" said Crisil chief economist DK Joshi.Economists concur that on most macro parameters, the Indian economy is healthy: India remains the fastest growing major economy, inflation is within RBI's comfort zone of under 4%, the fiscal numbers are transparent, bank and corporate balance sheets are not as fragile as 10 years ago, and the current account deficit remains within control. Apart from cleaning up its books, the Centre is seen to be prudent in fiscal management.""India demonstrated exemplary commitment to fiscal prudence and discipline over the last one decade despite the unprecedented Covid shock. Accordingly, India's public debt profile turns out to be a strong advantage today, much in contrast to the current global trend. Lower public debt, along with better anchored inflation and current account deficit, political stability and strong domestic demand amidst the current uncertain global economic environment, has enormously enhanced India's attractiveness as a preferred investor destination over the past decade,"" said Siddhartha Sanyal, chief economist and head of research at Bandhan Bank.What govt and economists are worried about is a pick-up in private investment as companies are not adding capacity that will create more jobs. Creating more jobs in the organised sector is seen to be the biggest challenge for govt. Technology and AI are making the task tougher.Experts have argued that govt now needs to move quickly on two critical reforms - land and labour. While it did try to fix land acquisition related issues soon after coming to office in 2014, protests prompted it to drop the plans, just as it retreated on farm law amendments. On labour, while govt managed to enact the four codes, it has been wary of notifying them, blaming the reluctance in some opposition-governed states. They are seen to be particularly crucial at a time when India is signing several free trade agreements, which will see it lower tariffs.With BJP dependent on coalition partners, strategic sale of public sector companies and asset monetisation, which would have helped generate resources for fresh capex are issues that are on the back burner. But the new found political confidence may help Modi move faster.","The economy delivered an average growth of 6.2% and an inflation rate of 5% over the last 11 years, despite the pandemic.

Indian companies may double capex to $850 billion in next five years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-companies-may-double-capex-to-850-billion-in-next-five-years/articleshow/121765343.cms,"MUMBAI: India's corporate sector is gearing up for its largest capital expenditure cycle in over a decade, with companies poised to nearly double their investments over the next five years, according to S&P Global Ratings.The rating agency estimates total capex could reach $800 billion to $850 billion, mostly funded through operating cash flows and supported by domestic financing channels. If execution remains on track and macroeconomic conditions hold steady, S&P expects companies to expand without significantly increasing debt.Infrastructure will drive the surge, led by power, roads, and transport, where spending is expected to double.

Maruti Suzuki Cuts e-Vitara Production by 67% Due to Rare Earth Magnet Shortage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/maruti-cuts-production-of-electric-vitara-due-to-chinese-magnet-shortage-in-fy26-april-september-period/articleshow/121764836.cms,"NEW DELHI: In one of the first major companies to go for production cuts due to a shortage in rare earth magnet supplies from China, top carmaker Maruti Suzuki decided to cut back on the initial production schedule for its first electric car, the e-Vitara, by over two-thirds in the first half of this fiscal to factor in the squeeze in part shipments.While the company’s original production plan to manufacture around 67,000 units by March 2026 remains in place, it will “go slow in the first half of the fiscal” where it is building inventory for exports as well as some sales in the Indian market, supplier sources told TOI.“The original production plan for the FY26 April-September period was to do around 27,000 units. This now looks challenging, and Maruti Suzuki is looking to do only around 8,000 units or a little over that,” the sources said.A spokesperson for the company refused to comment on the matter.It is not yet clear whether the company will delay the launch of the e-Vitara, which is its first battery-electric vehicle (BEV) in the country. The e-Vitara is being produced at Maruti’s plant in Gujarat, and the company hoped to begin sales by the start of the festive season in the second half of the fiscal.The company showcased the car at the Auto Expo held in the national capital earlier this year and plans to take on electric models from Tata Motors , Mahindra & Mahindra, JSW MG Motor, and Hyundai with the green car.Sources said that the shortage of magnets, used for components like speedometers, electric motors, e-axles, electric water pumps, automatic transmission kits, speakers, sensors, and ignition coils in engines, is also seeing Maruti re-calibrate production plans for other models.“The company is assessing dealer inventory levels for various models and using the rare earth magnet inventory for cars that have a higher demand. The work on re-calibration of production plans is in progress. Almost daily assessments are being carried out to be in line with the market realities related to the availability of magnets,” one of the sources said.The e-Vitara is one of the most ambitious products from Maruti Suzuki, and the company plans to sell it across continents including Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Africa, and the home market India. The plan is to also do product-sharing with Toyota, which will be selling the car under a different badge and distinct design cues. This is in line with the product-sharing plans already in place between the two Japanese companies.Maruti officials have been negotiating with govt officials on the matter of magnet supplies, and through the industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, the company has been seeking facilitation for an early resolution of the matter.The company is among those who submitted applications for getting supplies of the crucial ingredient through the process mandated by the Chinese govt. However, with delays from the Chinese side, there has been a demand that the govt and the Indian embassy in China intervene to hasten the approval process.The company recently said it would be difficult to give ""very specific details"" on the magnet crisis until it receives a response to its application submitted for consideration by the Chinese govt. ""It is not a restriction. It is an endorsement of end use. In case there is an issue, we will inform all our stakeholders, including the stock exchange,"" Rahul Bharti, Senior Executive Director, Corporate Affairs, said.","Maruti Suzuki is one of the first major companies to go for production cuts due to a shortage in rare earth magnet supplies from China.

"Relax production-linked incentive, PM e-drive schemes, say auto companies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/auto-industry-seeks-relaxation-of-local-sourcing-rules-due-to-china-magnet-shortage/articleshow/121764805.cms,"NEW DELHI: With supply chains crippled due to the severe curbs on shipments of rare earth magnets by China, the auto industry raised an SOS and sought relaxation from the govt in meeting the all-crucial domestic value addition (DVA) norms towards the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the phased manufacturing programme (PMP) in the PM e-Drive programme.Sources said the companies, which include top manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto, Hero Moto, TVS, and Tata Motors, also petitioned the govt for permission to import complete assemblies of components from China in the short term to ensure that production schedules are not disturbed.“DVA requirement in PLI and PMP in PM e-Drive schemes may have to be relaxed to allow for imports of completed assemblies,” the industry – which is currently not getting supplies from China and is banking only on existing inventory – said in a representation to the central govt, the sources told TOI.“In the eventuality of the challenge not being resolved, the industry will be constrained to import complete assemblies of components from China in the short term,” the companies said, adding that the measure may result in a loss of business for local manufacturers of motors, sensors, and other components who use rare earth magnets.They also said that despite the import of full assemblies, there may still be challenges in production plans.“… this will not resolve the immediate problem of disruption in manufacturing, as the new components are not designed/compatible with the requirement of the vehicles being produced in India.”The companies also said that local value add-on in the vehicles will also be impacted as companies import complete assemblies from China, leading to cost escalations. “The imports in the auto sector will rise as complete assemblies will have much higher cost.”The industry requested the govt to take measures so that India becomes self-reliant in the production of rare earth permanent magnets by establishing a complete domestic value chain. “Financial incentives linked to production and policy support may be extended to promising manufacturers. Encourage local mining and production of magnets for reducing dependence on China through incentives. Financial and policy support may be provided to encourage public-private partnerships in setting up rare earth processing facilities and magnet production clusters across India,” the companies said.As magnet supplies stopped following new procurement procedures mandated by China to control any diversion towards defence and weapons production, auto companies raised an alarm over the impending challenges. They said that the matter will lead to the stoppage of production of certain models in June, while heading to a complete shutdown of production by the middle of July if new supplies were not forthcoming.The industry said that the shortage will impact the planned launch of many new models, apart from disturbing the entire value chain across passenger vehicles, two-wheelers, and commercial vehicles.The rare earth magnets are used for components like speedometers, electric motors, e-axles, electric water pumps, automatic transmission kits, speakers, sensors, and ignition coils in engines.Companies say a multi-layered approval process has to be followed before the magnets can be procured, and a final approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce is also required.","The auto industry raised an SOS and sought relaxation from the govt in meeting the all-crucial domestic value addition (DVA) norms towards the production- linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the phased manufacturing programme (PMP) in the PM e-Drive programme.

"Trade tremors deepen: World Bank slashes global growth forecast to 2.3% for 2025; warns of long-term hit from tariffs, inflation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-tremors-deepen-world-bank-slashes-global-growth-forecast-to-2-3-for-2025-warns-of-long-term-hit-from-tariffs-inflation/articleshow/121756722.cms,"Developing economies face slower recovery

Global growth will slow sharply this year as trade disruptions triggered by sweeping US tariffs increase uncertainty and fragment markets, the World Bank warned in its latest economic outlook released Tuesday.The multilateral lender cut its 2025 global GDP growth forecast to 2.3%, down from the 2.7% estimated in January, citing a weakening trade environment and deteriorating investor sentiment, AFP reported. That would mark the slowest pace of non-recessionary expansion in nearly two decades.“This is the weakest performance in 17 years, outside of outright global recessions,” said Indermit Gill, chief economist of the World Bank Group, in a press briefing.Meanwhile, World Bank pegged India's economic growth projection at a lower level of 6.3 per cent for 2025-26 due to pressure on exports emanating from global uncertainties, though the country will remain the fastest growing major global economy. In April, the World Bank had lowered India's growth projection for 2025-26 to 6.3 per cent from its January forecast of 6.7 per cent.The World Bank said high levels of policy uncertainty—driven by US President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff regime—were dragging down both growth and inflation expectations.Trump’s 10% import tariff, rolled out in April and targeting nearly all US trade partners, has since been suspended temporarily until July. The tariff war with China has also paused, but prospects for a durable truce remain unclear.“Without a swift course correction, the harm to living standards could be deep,” Gill cautioned.While advanced economies have seen a steeper cut in their growth forecasts, the World Bank noted that emerging markets—particularly commodity exporters—are facing a damaging mix of low prices and market volatility.Roughly 60% of developing nations are commodity exporters and are now grappling with what Gill called a “very nasty combination” of falling prices and unpredictable global demand.The bank projects global growth to average just 2.5% for the remainder of the decade through 2029, making it the slowest ten-year growth rate since the 1960s.By 2027, the per capita GDP of high-income countries is expected to return to its pre-pandemic trajectory. But for developing nations—excluding China—per capita output is projected to be 6% below pre-Covid forecasts, Gill said. “Except for China, it could take these economies about two decades to recoup the economic losses of the 2020s,” he warned.Despite the grim outlook, the World Bank stressed that decisive policy moves could still avert permanent damage. “If the right policy actions are taken, this problem can be made to go away with limited long-term damage,” Gill said.The report urged G20 economies to avoid trade fragmentation and suggested that developing nations should reduce tariffs across the board—not just with the US—and harmonise cross-border rules to drive sustainable growth.Tariffs in developing countries are generally higher than in advanced economies, the Bank noted, often due to protectionist strategies or limited sources of government revenue.The World Bank’s warning comes amid a series of downgrades by other global agencies. The OECD this month cut its 2025 global growth projection from 3.1% to 2.9%, citing the chilling effects of Trump’s trade actions. In April, the IMF lowered its forecast from 3.3% to 2.8%.","The World Bank cut its 2025 global GDP growth forecast to 2.3%, down from the 2.7% estimated in January.

Trade negotiations between the US and China continue for a second day in London on Tuesday, following US President Donald Trump 's assessment that while China presents challenges, the US is making progress in the discussions.At Lancaster House, a prominent 19th-century building situated near Buckingham Palace, the Chinese delegation headed by Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged with US officials including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday.The Chinese representation includes Wang Wentao, the commerce minister, alongside trade negotiator Li Chenggang.Trump's Monday evening statement to journalists confirmed, ""We are doing well with China. China's not easy.""Following their Geneva discussions last month, both nations agreed to pause the implementation of substantial tariffs for 90 days, addressing concerns about potential economic downturn caused by their ongoing trade disputes.Post-Geneva talks, tensions have risen between the nations regarding AI-capable semiconductors, visa policies for Chinese students in American educational institutions, and the supply of ""rare earth"" minerals crucial to manufacturing sectors.Last Thursday, Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping conducted an extensive telephone conversation to improve diplomatic relations. Trump subsequently announced via social media that negotiations would commence in London.As the primary global supplier of rare earths, China has indicated potential relaxation of its April export limitations, which had caused concern among global automotive manufacturers. Simultaneously, Beijing seeks removal of US restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology.Trump expressed his intention to increase Chinese market access for American products. ""If we don't open up China, maybe we won't do anything,"" Trump said at the White House. ""But we want to open up China.""This comes as top US and Chinese officials convened in London on Monday to work on stabilizing the delicate pause in their trade conflict, which has impacted global markets.The latest round of diplomacy follows a tentative agreement in Geneva last month, where both sides committed to a 90-day pause on the steep tariffs, some over 100%, they had imposed on each other in a tit-for-tat escalation.The temporary truce, announced on May 12, offered some breathing space, though tensions remain high. Since the Geneva breakthrough, the two nations have had disagreements over advanced semiconductors used in artificial intelligence, visa restrictions for Chinese students in the US, and the export of rare earth minerals, critical raw materials used in electric vehicles and consumer electronics.The rare earths issue is likely to be a key topic in the London talks, after China began mandating export licenses for producers dealing in seven of these materials in April. The move triggered supply shortages, sending global automakers scrambling and raising fears of production halts.","Top US and Chinese officials convened in London on Monday to work on stabilizing the delicate pause in their trade conflict.

US President Donald Trump has dismissed rumours that he plans to sell or give away his red Tesla Model S, saying he might simply “move it around” to a different location instead.Speaking at a White House press briefing on Monday (local time), Trump was asked if he intended to part with the high-profile electric vehicle he purchased on March 11. “Are you going to get rid of your Tesla?” a reporter asked.“No, I may move it around a little bit,” Trump responded.When pressed on where the car might be relocated, Trump responded cryptically, “I have a lot of locations.”Trump also clarified he has no plans to discontinue Musk’s satellite internet venture, Starlink, calling it a “great service.”When asked if he plans to speak with Elon Musk soon, Trump said, “If I were him, I would want to speak to me. Maybe he’s already called. You’d have to ask him.”Relations between the two men have soured in recent weeks after Musk sharply criticised Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” calling it an “abomination” over concerns it would explode the federal deficit.In response, Trump threatened to revoke Musk’s government contracts, prompting Musk to warn that SpaceX could pull its Dragon program in retaliation.Despite the tensions, Trump’s Tesla, originally intended as a symbolic stand against left-wing attacks on Musk’s ventures, remains a visible gesture of support in the White House driveway.The car, which the US President bought on March 11 during a public show was in support for Elon Musk.The high-end Model S, estimated to cost over $100,000, is currently parked in the White House lot for staff use, as the president himself is not allowed to drive under security regulations.The Tesla Model S, launched in 2012, was the company’s first mass-market electric car and remains one of its most advanced vehicles.The Model S stands out with its sleek design, large touchscreen display, and cutting-edge features. It offers both Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability, allowing the car to automatically change lanes, navigate highways from on-ramp to off-ramp, and even park itself.Inside, the car features an optional yoke-style steering wheel, similar to those used in Formula 1, and a rear-seat display for passengers to watch movies or play games.The second-row seating has been redesigned to comfortably seat three adults, offering more legroom, headroom, and a fold-down armrest.One of its key safety features is Sentry Mode, which uses cameras and sensors to monitor the car’s surroundings when parked. If it detects suspicious activity or potential damage, it sends real-time alerts to the owner.With its blend of luxury, technology, and safety, the Model S continues to be one of Tesla’s flagship electric vehicles.","US President Donald Trump has dismissed rumours that he plans to sell or give away his red Tesla Model S.

India-EFTA trade agreement: Deal set to kick in by September; $100 billion investment incoming in 15 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-efta-trade-agreement-deal-set-to-kick-in-by-september-100-billion-investment-incoming-in-15-years/articleshow/121733506.cms,"India Inks Another Big Trade Deal with EFTA, $100-Billion Worth Deal From September: Piyush Goyal

The much-awaited free trade agreement between India and the four-nation European bloc EFTA is expected to come into force by September this year, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal announced on Monday.The trade and economic partnership agreement (TEPA), signed on 10 March 2024, marks a significant milestone in India’s trade diplomacy. Under the deal, India has secured a commitment of $100 billion in investments over the next 15 years from the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which comprises Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.Speaking to reporters during his official visit to Switzerland, Goyal confirmed, “By September, TEPA will be operationalised. It will enter into force by September.”The agreement has already been cleared by the Parliaments of all four EFTA countries, with an objection window in Switzerland open until 10 July, the minister said, cited by PTI.The agreement is expected to slash or eliminate import duties on a range of European goods, including Swiss watches, chocolates, and cut and polished diamonds, benefiting Indian consumers and industries alike.During his visit, Goyal engaged with leaders and business representatives, holding one-on-one discussions with over a dozen Swiss firms. He said most companies expressed strong interest in investing in India. Swizz companies, especially, have shown interest in sectors like pharmaceuticals, cybersecurity, and machinery manufacturing.“Lots of excitement here for India,” Goyal said.During his bilateral meetings, he also encouraged companies to hold their board meetings in India, allowing them to witness the country's investment potential firsthand.He noted that 100 per cent foreign direct investment is permitted in machinery manufacturing in India, which could help reduce the country’s reliance on machine imports from China.The minister also offered an update on other trade negotiations, stating that India is in active discussions with New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Oman, and the European Union. A deal with the EU could be concluded “faster than expected,” he hinted, alongside a possible finalisation of a bilateral investment treaty.Reflecting on the 11-year tenure of the NDA government, Goyal said FTAs have played a crucial role in positioning India as a top destination for global investment.“The world today recognises that the best place to do business is India,” he said. “India is also a preferred destination for services.”He highlighted the growing presence of global capability centres (GCCs) in India, with nearly 2,000 already established. On manufacturing, he pointed to the success of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which has boosted local content in air conditioner manufacturing from 20 per cent to 65 per cent.All of this has been made possible because of the “good governance” of the last 11 years, he said.","Trade and economic partnership agreement (TEPA) signed on 10 March 2024.

Amazon's Pennsylvania investment: 2 data centres worth $20 billion; One taps directly into nuclear power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazons-pennsylvania-investment-2-data-centres-worth-20-billion-one-taps-directly-into-nuclear-power/articleshow/121732372.cms,"Why the scrutiny over the Susquehanna plant?

Amazon on Monday announced a $20 billion investment to develop two data centre complexes in Pennsylvania, adding to the billions of dollars that Big Tech’s have already poured into the state’s booming data centre industry.The e-commerce giant is planning to construct one data centre next to Susquehanna nuclear power plant, but the plan is now under federal investigation due to concerns over the company drawing power directly from the facility.The other is planned just north of Philadelphia, Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon Web Services told AP on Monday.The Pennsylvania investment follows a string of similar commitments by Amazon this year, with $10 billion each pledged for data centre projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina, marking an aggressive expansion as tech giants vie for dominance in the AI era.As cloud computing and AI continue to grow rapidly, the demand for data centers is also surging as the technologies require significant power to operate servers, storage systems, networking gear, and cooling infrastructure.The data centre near the Susquehanna plant stands out not just for its scale but for the way it plans to tap into power.In a deal struck last year, Talen Energy, majority owner of the nuclear facility, sold its adjacent data centre to Amazon for $650 million.The agreement would allow Amazon to access up to 960 megawatts of electricity, approximately 40% of the plant’s output, sufficient to power over 500,000 homes.However, the unique “behind the meter” arrangement, which enables Amazon to plug directly into the plant without routing through the broader power grid, has triggered the attention of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This is the first case of its kind to come before the agency.Regulators are now examining whether such setups unfairly allow large tech firms to bypass grid fees and if prioritising high-paying corporate users could jeopardise energy availability for others.","The e-commerce giant is planning to construct one data centre next to Susquehanna nuclear power plant, but the plan is now under federal investigation.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

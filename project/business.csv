India’s trade data: Top Highlights

India’s exports to the US have grown in October over September, despite the 50% tariffs imposed by American President Donald Trump on Indian goods. However, the exports to the US for October have registered a decline of 8.58% compared to October 2024. Global Trade and Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava notes that US-bound merchandise exports from India reached $6.3 billion in October, showing a 14.5% increase from September, marking the first monthly growth since May despite the 50% tariffs.US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India in August, 25% of which is a penalty for India’s crude oil imports from Russia. “Although October 2025 exports of $6.3 billion are 8.6% lower than the $6.9 billion recorded in October 2024, the month-on-month rise from September is a welcome improvement,” says GTRI.“Product-wise data for the USA for October are not yet available, but tariff-exempt sectors such as smartphones and pharmaceuticals may have performed better—though this remains only a tentative assumption. Despite the October rebound, India’s shipments to the US have dropped nearly 28.4% between May and October, erasing more than $2.5 billion in monthly export value,” GTRI adds.India's aggregate exports declined 11.8% year-on-year in October, indicating widespread global demand softness.Among India's top 20 markets, only 5 showed growth in October, with Spain (+43.4%) and China (+42.3%) showing highest increases. Spain led primarily due to enhanced petroleum product exports, whilst China. Hong Kong (+6.00%), Brazil (+3.54%), and Belgium (+2.22%) showed modest improvements.The remaining fifteen destinations saw drops, indicating widespread external challenges. The United States (-8.58%) and UAE (-10.17%) showed moderate declines. Substantial reductions occurred in Singapore (-54.85%), Australia (-52.42%), Italy (-27.66%), UK (-27.16%), and the Netherlands (-22.75%). Additional declines were noted in Malaysia (-22.68%), Korea (-16.43%), Germany (-15.14%), France (-14.28%), Bangladesh (-14.10%), Nepal (-12.64%), South Africa (-7.54%), and Saudi Arabia (-1.12%).Imports of gold rose by 188.2% whilst silver increased by 528.7%, pushing total imports to $73.2 billion, despite gems and jewellery exports declining by 29.5%.Following May 2025's growth of 4.8% to $8.8 billion, exports declined consistently: June showed -5.7% to $8.3 billion, July registered -3.6% to $8.0 billion, August saw -13.8% to $6.9 billion, and September experienced -20.3%, before showing signs of improvement in October.India recorded a significant increase in its merchandise imports, which reached $73.2 billion in October 2025, showing a 16.5% growth. The rise was primarily attributed to substantial increases in precious metals purchases.The country's gold imports witnessed a remarkable increase of 188.2%, totalling $14.7 billion. Similarly, silver imports demonstrated an exceptional growth of 528.7%, amounting to $2.7 billion compared to the previous year's figuresThis substantial increase in precious metal imports is particularly significant as India's gems and jewellery exports declined by 29.5% in October. This trend suggests that the imported gold and silver are primarily serving domestic consumption rather than being utilised for export-oriented manufacturing.","India recorded a significant increase in its merchandise imports, which reached $73.2 billion in October 2025, showing a 16.5% growth.

508-km corridor sees major civil progress

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked engineers working on the Mumbai–Ahmedabad bullet train project to systematically document their technical and on-ground experiences, saying such a record would help India replicate high-speed rail projects across the country without “repeated experimentation. ”Interacting with engineers and workers of the Mumbai–Ahmedabad High Speed Railway (MAHSR) corridor in Surat on Saturday, Modi said the learnings from India’s first bullet train effort should be compiled like a “Blue Book” so future teams understand why decisions were taken, not just what was done.“If these experiences are documented, the country can move confidently towards large-scale bullet train implementation,” he said, stressing that such material would help students and strengthen nation-building. “We will dedicate our lives here and leave behind something valuable for the country,” Modi added.The prime minister reviewed progress on construction targets, including speed and timetable milestones. Workers told him that the project was advancing smoothly. An engineer from Kerala described her experience at the Noise Barrier Factory in Navsari, where robotic systems are welding rebar cages. She called working on India’s first bullet train a “dream project” and a proud moment for her family.Another team member, Shruti from Bengaluru, serving as Lead Engineering Manager, outlined the design-review and engineering-control processes. She said her team evaluates pros and cons at every execution stage and explores alternatives to ensure error-free delivery.Modi said such stories reflect the motivation that comes from contributing to nation-building, drawing parallels with India’s early space missions and the exponential progress that followed.The 508-km MAHSR project covers 352 km in Gujarat and Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and 156 km in Maharashtra, connecting key nodes such as Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Vapi, Thane and Mumbai.Built with advanced engineering techniques, nearly 85 per cent of the route—465 km—is on elevated viaducts to reduce land disruption and boost safety. According to the PMO, 326 km of viaduct work is complete, along with 17 of 25 river bridges.Once operational, the bullet train is expected to cut travel time between Mumbai and Ahmedabad to around two hours, significantly improving inter-city mobility. The government says the project will spur business, tourism and economic activity along the corridor, helping catalyse regional development.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked engineers working on the Mumbai–Ahmedabad bullet train project to document their technical and on-ground experiences.

Gold price prediction today:

Gold prices are expected to be under pressure this week on global factors, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his views and recommendations for gold investors:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Last week, Gold and Silver prices fluctuated as shifting expectations for a December Federal Reserve rate cut and a series of weak US economic indicators shaped market sentiment. Signs of stress in the labor market, including October job losses and falling consumer sentiment, initially supported bullion, while prolonged uncertainty from the recently concluded 40-day government shutdown added to growth concerns.However, optimism faded as the shutdown’s end reduced safe-haven demand and traders sharply pared back the probability of a December rate cut from earlier estimates near 85–90% to around 45–70%. Fed officials adopted a more cautious stance amid persistent inflation risks and relative labor-market stability, contributing further to the pullback in precious metals. Physical demand across Asia remained subdued, with Indian dealers offering steep discounts as volatility deterred buyers, while Chinese demand softened on regulatory changes.A firmer dollar index and continued ETF outflows could continue to weigh on prices.With the IMF lowering its global growth forecast through 2026 and US data releases still normalizing post-shutdown, markets remain focused on upcoming indicators—particularly nonfarm payrolls— to gauge the Fed’s next move.The stance from President Trump on Tariffs, fed officials on interest rate and economic data releases post shutdown will be key triggers for Gold and Silver prices this week.Gold after marking $4200 has fallen towards its recent lows of $4050. Weak data points could support prices however, declining rate cut expectations and lower tariff dialogue could continue to keep prices under pressure dragging it towards immediate support of $4000 -3920. On the domestic front, ₹1,22,000 is an important support for any break below that we could see prices dragging towards ₹119500- 1,20,000. While on the higher side ₹1,25,000 is an important resistance and buying might resume above these levels.","Gold prices are expected to be under pressure this week on global factors, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

US SHUTDOWN OVER! Heated Debate On Healthcare In HOUSE Ends In SHOCKER For Dems | Watch

according to news agency AP

reported AP





The Federal Aviation Administration will lift all flight-reduction orders at 40 major airports from Monday, allowing airlines to return to normal operations after weeks of shutdown-triggered disruptions.In a joint statement, transportation secretary Sean Duffy and FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said regular schedules can resume from 6 am EST on Monday.The FAA had imposed the unprecedented limits from November 7 due to growing staffing shortages at air-traffic control facilities during what AP described as the country’s longest government shutdown.The cuts initially stood at 4%, rising to 6%, before being reduced to 3% on Friday as staffing improved following the shutdown’s end on November 12,Major hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta were among those affected.Cancellations fell to their lowest point this weekend, with aviation analytics firm Cirium showing fewer than 1% of flights cancelled.The FAA said its safety team recommended lifting the order after “detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events.” However, it noted reports of carrier non-compliance during the emergency period and said enforcement options were being assessed.The worst disruption came on November 9, when more than 2,900 flights were cut due to the FAA order, controller shortages and severe weather,Controllers, who worked without pay during the 43-day shutdown, had missed two paychecks.According to NBC News, staffing levels have now “stabilised,” enabling the emergency order to end.Staffing-trigger events dropped sharply—from 81 on November 8 to just one on Sunday.Other restrictions, such as limits on visual flight rule approaches and commercial space launches, will also end.Under the original emergency order, reductions were set to climb to 10%, but officials froze them at 6% on Wednesday before scaling them down to 3% on Friday.Duffy said the agency can now “refocus” on controller hiring and building a “state-of-the-art air traffic control system the American people deserve.”","The Federal Aviation Administration will lift all flight-reduction orders at 40 major airports from Monday.

Asian markets fell on Tuesday as caution spread across global equities ahead of several delayed US economic releases and shifting expectations around the Federal Reserve’s next move.The weakness followed a tech-led slide on Wall Street overnight, with investors watching closely for Thursday’s September nonfarm payrolls report to gauge the strength of the US economy.Stocks across the region opened lower. As per news agency Reuters, MSCI’s broad Asia-Pacific index excluding Japan was down 0.7%, while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled more than 2%.The Topix slipped 0.6%, South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.64% and the Kosdaq 0.58%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index declined 0.86%, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.76%. Mainland China’s CSI 300 traded flat.Sentiment in Japan was also shaped by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s first meeting with Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda since taking office, as per Reuters.Analysts at JBWere said markets were keen to see how the new leadership would balance easy-policy preferences with Ueda’s recent signals of a possible rate hike as early as next month.Takaichi and finance minister Satsuki Katayama have publicly backed keeping rates low until inflation stays near the BOJ’s 2% target.As per CNBC, Bond yields in Japan continued to climb, with the 20-year yield rising to 2.78%—its highest since 1999—while the 10-year yield hit 1.751%.Overnight in the US, the Dow lost 557 points, or 1.18%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.92% and 0.84%.Nvidia slipped nearly 2% ahead of its earnings due Wednesday, dragging other tech shares lower amid growing concerns about stretched valuations.Investors have dialled back expectations of a Fed rate cut in December, as per Reuters, with markets now pricing in roughly a 40% chance, down from over 60% earlier this month.The cautious mood kept the dollar index 0.2% higher at 99.545, while the yen weakened to 155.29 per dollar, its softest since early February. Japan’s finance minister said she was “alarmed” by the currency’s recent volatility, reported Reuters.Commodities also reflected the risk-off tone. Gold slipped 0.3% to $4,030 an ounce, while Brent crude fell nearly 0.5% to $63.91 a barrel.Oil prices softened further after Russia’s Novorossiysk port resumed loadings sooner than expected following a two-day halt caused by a Ukrainian drone and missile strike.Brent dipped 28 cents to $63.92 and US WTI eased 26 cents to $59.65.IG analyst Tony Sycamore said crude was trading slightly lower as operations normalised.Exports from Novorossiysk and the nearby CPC terminal—together responsible for about 2% of global supply—had been paused late last week, briefly lifting prices more than 2%.Traders are now watching the longer-term impact of Western sanctions on Russian flows, with the US treasury noting that restrictions on Rosneft and Lukoil were already squeezing Moscow’s revenues.A senior White House official quoted by Reuters said that President Donald Trump is prepared to sign sanctions legislation as long as final control stays with him. Trump also said Republicans were working on a bill that could target any country doing business with Russia, potentially including Iran.Goldman Sachs expects oil prices to decline through 2026 due to a wave of new supply, though it noted Brent could climb above $70 in 2026-27 if Russian output drops sharply, reported Reuters. Bitcoin edged up 0.3% after touching a seven-month low earlier in the session, with nearly 22% wiped off its value in three months.","MSCI's broad Asia-Pacific index was down 0.7%, while Japan's Nikkei tumbled more than 2%. weakness followed a tech-led slide on Wall Street overnight.

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: State-run oil companies have signed a one-year deal to buy 2.2m tonnes of cooking gas from the US, about 10% of India's LPG imports. It's expected to help cut the trade imbalance, a key complaint of the Trump administration.""A historic first! One of the largest and the world's fastest growing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market opens up to the US. In our endeavour to provide secure affordable supplies of LPG to the people of India, we have been diversifying our LPG sourcing,"" petroleum minister Hardeep Puri posted on X. The gas will be sourced from the US Gulf Coast and the purchase in 2026 will be linked to Mont Belvieu as the benchmark, the minister said.While the exact figures remain confidential, analysts peg Mont Belvieu propane at roughly $650-$700 per metric tonne and butane at $550-$600 per tonne as of Nov 2025.Historically, India has leaned on Gulf partners, mainly Qatar, UAE and Saudi, for over 80% of its LPG imports. Qatar dominates with a 27% share (down from 32% in 2012-13), followed by UAE at 26% and Saudi at 19%. These Gulf majors have been reliable, but volatility, exacerbated by Red Sea disruptions and OPEC+ cuts, prompted US outreach, according to New Delhi.""India has been contemplating purchasing from the US for long. It's not part of any negotiation per se,"" commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said, adding that the idea is to keep trade more balanced.Recent data suggested that India's crude imports from US have climbed to the highest level since March 2021, indicating that it is not just diversifying its oil purchases but also looking to address the US administration's concern. India is also looking to purchase more American products, though the commerce secretary did not comment on the issue.The deal followed talks between IndianOil, BPCL and HPCL and major US producers over the last few months, oil minister Hardeep Puri said.India ran a trade surplus of $42 billion with the US during the last financial year, exporting goods worth $86 billion.During his recent visit to DC for trade talks, commerce minister Piyush Goyal had said that India was open to more energy purchases from the US as it will need fuel to meet its growth requirements.","State-run oil companies have signed a one-year deal to buy 2.2m tonnes of cooking gas from the US.

Gold imports are estimated to have surged three times to $14.7 billion in Oct, from $4.2 billion in the corresponding period in 2024. As a result, during April-Oct, gold imports were up 21% to $41.2 billion. (see graphic).Unlike gold, which is largely seen as an investment, silver imports were up both in value and volume terms. The value of these shipments was seen to be 52% higher at $3.2 billion during the first half. But a 6.3-fold surge to $2.7 billion Oct meant that silver imports so far this year were 2.4 times higher at $5.9 billion.""The rise in silver imports is attributed to an increase in international price and also due to higher industrial demand in sectors, such as solar panel, electronics, EVs and pharma,"" DGFT Ajay Bhadoo said, while disclosing the numbers.In the first half, silver prices (based on unit value of imports) are seen to have been 26% higher, while there was a 22% increase in the case of gold.The spike in Oct is seen to have been due to the festival demand, commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said. Gold and silver purchases increase ahead of Diwali. ""We export around 800 tonnes of gold (annually) and we have crossed the halfway mark. In case we go to the same level of purchase, there will be a challenge because a 20-25% increase in prices will increase the import bill,"" he said.

MUMBAI: The sales of consumer goods like soaps, shampoos and washing detergents slowed in the Sept quarter in anticipation of the GST cuts, impacting FMCG volume growth sequentially. Volumes grew by 5.4% compared to 6% in the June quarter with the decline being led by the home and personal care categories, data released by NielsenIQ on Monday showed.As markets prepared for the new GST rates to kick in from Sept 22, consumers delayed purchases to avail benefits of the reduced prices while retailers slowed stocking up shelves, hitting sales of FMCG companies such as HUL and Colgate Palmolive (India). Value growth stood at 12.9% in the quarter, led by a 7.1% increase in prices and down marginally over the previous quarter.""With inflation easing, the outlook for consumption remains optimistic and the impact of GST changes on consumption is expected in the next two quarters,"" said Sharang Pant, head of customer success, FMCG, NielsenIQ in India. Value growth and volume growth stood at 5.3% and 3.5%, respectively, in the year-ago period.Govt cut GST rates on a host of essentials and regular household items to spur consumption; companies are passing on the benefits through a mix of price cuts and grammage increases. Firms had earlier said that markets would resume normal operations from Nov.

Rural volumes increased by 7.7%, lower than the 8.4% growth recorded in the preceding quarter but higher than urban's 3.7% expansion.In urban India, smaller towns are leading the demand recovery given that the shift to online channels is not yet as rampant as in the metros where people are increasingly shifting to quick commerce platforms.

In Delhi-NCR and Kolkata, for instance, e-commerce growth has surpassed that of modern trade channels.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as 'very poor' — despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog continued to blanket Delhi on Monday, showing little improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 385.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Iconic areas like India Gate and Kartavya Path were shrouded in toxic smog, with AQI readings of 341 (‘very poor’). Other hotspots included Chandni Chowk (383), RK Puram (366), ITO (394), Punjabi Bagh (384), Patparganj (369), Pusa (365), and Dwarka Sector-8 (356).Meanwhile, Anand Vihar remained engulfed in a layer of toxic smog, with the CPCB reporting an AQI of 383, classified as ‘very poor’.The thick smog, along with deteriorating air quality, mercury continued to hover around the 9 Degree Celsius mark, with some areas recording even lower temperatures.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.Following the deteriorating air quality in the national capital, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III was implemented on November 11 across Delhi by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The measures aim to control emissions through stricter restrictions on construction, vehicular movement and industrial operations.Under GRAP-III, restrictions include a ban on most non-essential construction, limits on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of in-person classes for students up to Class 5 with a shift to online or hybrid learning, curbs on industries using non-clean fuels, and a ban on non-emergency diesel generators.Earlier, the Supreme Court directed the governments of Punjab and Haryana to file a status report on the measures taken to curb stubble burning, which contributes to the air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region.A bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered, ""We direct the state of Punjab and Haryana to file a report on what steps are being taken to curb stubble burning.""Since Diwali, air quality in Delhi and the NCR has remained in the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories in several areas, despite Stage III of the GRAP being in effect.","The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am.

TOI correspondent from Washington

India Brushes Off US Threats, Doubles Russian Oil Imports Amid Global Tensions | Watch

: In a landmark move to both bolster its energy security and mollify MAGA-infused Washington, India will buy 2.2 million tonnes of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States under an initial one-year contract.The agreement marks the first structured purchase of American gas for the Indian market, with global giants Chevron, Phillips 66, and TotalEnergies Trading SA expected to ferry the LPG to India in 48 very-large gas tankers. Effective from January 2026, with possible extensions, the state-run oil majors Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) will handle supplies at the Indian end.“A historic first! One of the largest and the world’s fastest growing LPG market opens up to the United States,” India’s minister for petroleum and natural gas announced on social media on Monday, even as US President Donald Trump threw his support behind lawmakers drafting a bill that would sanction countries purchasing Russian oil and gas to the tune of 500 per cent.The legislation still has some distance to go. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, who first introduced the bill in April 2025, said in a joint statement on Sunday that “The ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries, like China, India and Brazil, that prop up Putin’s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.”India buys most of the gas it imports from the Gulf, mainly Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia, even as it is whittling down oil purchase from Russia to free itself from the punitive 25 per cent additional sanctions tariff related to this.The volume of U.S export represents only 10per cent of India's total annual LPG imports projected at around 22 MTPA to meet surging domestic demand as more Indians transition to the use of LPG. This effectively leaves room for more purchases subject to competitive pricing.Puri said the purchase is based on using Mount Belvieu – the premier US LPG pricing hub – as the benchmark. While exact figures remain confidential, analysts peg Mont Belvieu propane at roughly $650–$700 per metric tonne and butane at $550–$600 per tonne as of November 2025.For Indian consumers, this translates to subsidized 14.2-kg cylinders under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) staying affordable at Rs 500–Rs 550, thanks to government absorbing over Rs 40,000 crore in subsidies last year amid 60per cent global price spikes.“Our PSU oil companies have been providing LPG at the lowest global prices to all our mothers and sisters. Even as global prices soared by over 60per cent last year, Modi Ji ensured that our Ujjwala consumers continued to receive LPG cylinder at just Rs 500-550 whereas the actual cost of the cylinder was over Rs 1100,” Puri said.The LPG deal forms part of a nascent bilateral trade agreement (BTA), with five negotiation rounds completed and a first-phase closure imminent, as confirmed by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. ""This isn't just about energy; it's about fair, equitable ties,"" Goyal stated last week at the Udyog Samagam 2025 forum. Trump recently noted the two nations are ""pretty close"" to a ""fair trade deal,"" potentially easing tariffs in exchange for boosted US energy inflows.India's push for diversification stems from its heavy reliance on imports, which met over 67per cent of LPG needs in 2024—a sharp rise from 47per cent in 2015—driven by stagnant domestic production and redirection of refinery output to higher-margin petrochemicals. Total consumption hit 28.7 million tonnes last year, with monthly averages at 2.6 million tonnes in early 2025, fueled by PMUY's expansion to 10.3 crore beneficiaries and a total domestic customer base of 33 crores.Historically, India has leaned on Gulf partners for over 80per cent of its LPG imports. Qatar dominates with a 27per cent share (down from 32 percent in 2012–13), followed by the UAE at 26per cent and Saudi Arabia at 19per cent. These Gulf majors have been reliable, but volatility—exacerbated by Red Sea disruptions and OPEC+ cuts—prompted the US outreach, according to New Delhi.Months of talks, including site visits by IOCL, BPCL, and HPCL executives to American facilities, paved the way. ""We've shielded households from shocks; now, we're securing supplies,"" Puri emphasized on X, crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision.","India will buy 2.2 million tonnes of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States under an initial one-year contract.

Wall Street opened the week on a subdued note on Monday as investors braced for Nvidia’s much-watched earnings and the first US government economic data release in six weeks. Trading was mixed in early hours, with futures on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping less than 0.1 per cent, while Nasdaq futures nudged up by a similar margin.Alphabet shares jumped more than 4 per cent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had taken a stake of more than $4 billion in the Google parent.Nvidia, which recently became the first firm to briefly cross a $5 trillion market capitalisation, will release quarterly results on Wednesday after market close. The stock has eased in recent weeks amid warnings that AI-linked valuations may have overheated.The earnings print is expected to be a key test. Analysts said companies often counter overvaluation worries by “delivering solid growth in profits”, raising the stakes for Nvidia’s summer quarter.A string of major US retailers — Home Depot, Target and Walmart — will also post results this week, offering clues to consumer strength in the absence of official economic indicators.The 43-day federal shutdown halted key releases, leaving the Federal Reserve and markets without fresh numbers on jobs, inflation and GDP since late summer.The Labor Department will publish September hiring and unemployment data on Thursday, marking the end of the data drought.European markets slipped at midday, with Germany’s DAX down 0.6 per cent, France’s CAC 40 off 0.5 per cent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 easing 0.2 per cent.Asia saw mixed moves.

Donald Trump Signals Harsh Sanctions On Russia’s Trading Partners With India On List For Oil Trade

A new analysis by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies has cautioned that the worldwide effort to move away from Russian gas is creating fresh instability in the market, largely because of tighter supplies and shifting political alignments.The report says that cutting reliance on Moscow has pushed several countries to depend more heavily on the United States, describing the shift as an increased dependence on “an increasingly volatile ally in the US.”According to news agency ANI, sanctions on Russian energy have pushed global demand towards American LNG, placing the US in a position to dominate LNG supply growth. Its export capacity is expected to almost double by 2030, at a time when the global gas market is already facing upheaval.The study warns that although a new wave of LNG supplies may ease pressure later this decade, price swings are likely to worsen in the near term.Gas is increasingly being used to back up renewable power, and delays in new investments could trigger shortages. Such pressures, the report notes, could fuel political friction, especially if major producers accuse the EU of adding regulatory and pricing uncertainties.The institute also highlighted concerns over Washington’s push to expand markets for US LNG — a trend particularly strong under the Trump administration — saying this could politicise gas trade and undermine long-term buyer confidence.The long-term outlook for natural gas is already uncertain, with renewables challenging it in Europe and China, and coal remaining competitive in India and parts of Asia.Another risk flagged in the report is the United States’ influence over global energy flows through the dollar-clearing system, which enables it to impose unilateral or secondary sanctions.This power, the study says, increases the chance of disruptions and is encouraging countries like Russia, China, India and Iran to explore trade in local currencies.Globalised gas markets have further amplified these vulnerabilities. As per ANI, interconnected benchmarks now mean that a supply shock in one region can instantly raise prices elsewhere. After the Ukraine conflict, European and Asian gas prices effectively converged, turning Europe’s energy crisis into Asia’s.The volatility has raised concerns among major Asian buyers, including China and India, about whether LNG can be relied upon for power generation and industrial use in the long run.India on Monday announced that it signed a significant one-year agreement to source 2.2 million tonnes of LPG from the United States — around 10 per cent of its annual imports — as part of its wider strategy to diversify fuel supplies.The deal comes amid strained India–US ties following President Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on India to 50 per cent.","New analysis by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies has cautioned that the worldwide effort to move away from Russian gas is creating fresh instability in the market.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

Pakistan’s central bank has introduced new restrictions to reduce the cash outflow of US dollars and protect the value of the Pakistan rupee.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has instructed banks not to hand out cash dollars to anyone who does not hold a foreign currency (FCY) account, meaning customers without such accounts can no longer buy cash dollars from banks.According to new agency PTI, the SBP circular states that all foreign currency sale transactions meant for deposits will now be completed through bank-to-bank transfers.The circular said: “In order to promote cashless economy , it has been decided that, henceforth, all FCY sale transactions to resident citizens of Pakistan for the purpose of deposit into FCY account will be executed through account-to-account transfer.”This effectively ends cash payouts for dollar purchases intended for deposit.Banks will now transfer dollars directly into a purchaser’s FCY account, while exchange dealers can give only $500 in cash without verification.Any higher amount will require customers to present documents, state their purpose, and complete biometric verification. Even those travelling for Hajj, Umra or studying abroad will need full documentation to buy more than $500.Exchange companies must also follow stricter procedures.Sardar Naseem of Galaxy Exchange was quoted as saying by PTI that customers buying dollars for deposit will receive cheques instead of cash, which banks will then credit to FCY accounts.He said the move is aimed at controlling the outflow of dollars and preventing money changers from keeping large dollar reserves in bank accounts.Currency experts cautioned that buyers of euros or pounds may face delays, as cheques issued for these currencies could take five to seven days to clear.Pakistan’s financial pressures have been mounting, as the country’s total public debt climbed to $286.832 billion (PKR 80.6 trillion) by June 2025, nearly 13% higher than the previous year.According to the finance ministry’s Annual Debt Review, the debt-to-GDP ratio rose to about 70%, driven largely by weaker-than-expected economic growth and subdued inflation.Domestic debt jumped 15% year-on-year while external debt increased by 6% to $91.8 billion, supported by IMF disbursements, a $1 billion ADB-guaranteed commercial loan, and fresh inflows from multilateral lenders.Provincial debt also rose, led by Punjab and Sindh, while overall 84% of the country’s external public debt sits with the federal government.Despite some signs of recovery—such as a current account surplus, higher reserves of $16.64 billion, and modest GDP growth—the rising debt burden underlines Pakistan’s fragile economic position.",State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has instructed banks not to hand out cash dollars to anyone who does not hold a foreign currency (FCY) account. Customers without FCY accounts can no longer buy cash dollars from banks.

Global equities are expected to generate strong long-term gains even though market valuations remain high, with Goldman Sachs forecasting an annualised return of 7.7 per cent in US Dollar terms over the next decade.The projection comes from the investment bank’s latest Global Strategy Paper titled Building Long-Term Returns: Our 10-Year Forecasts.According to news agency ANI, Goldman Sachs said its estimate is close to the historical median and is supported by structural factors such as nominal growth, profitability and shareholder payouts.The bank noted, “We expect global equities to deliver a 10-year total return of 7.7 per cent in USD,” despite pricey starting valuations.The firm’s building-block model derives long-term returns from earnings growth, dividend yield and valuation changes.Earnings remain the key driver, with Goldman Sachs expecting global earnings — including buybacks — to grow at roughly 6 per cent annually, ANI reported.Dividends are likely to contribute about 2 per cent, while valuations may slightly weigh on returns over the decade.Goldman Sachs acknowledged that current market valuations, at around 19 times forward earnings, are elevated but said “valuation, however, is not the whole story” and pointed to higher margins and improved return on equity as support for these levels.Regional returns over the next 10 years are expected to vary significantly. Emerging Markets are projected to deliver the highest returns at 10.9 per cent, driven by strong earnings growth in China and India.Asia ex-Japan may generate 10.3 per cent, supported by 9 per cent earnings growth and a 2.7 per cent dividend yield.Japan is forecast to give 8.2 per cent, helped by reforms and 6 per cent EPS growth. Europe may return 7.1 per cent, with about half coming from dividends and buybacks, as per ANI.The United States is expected to lag at 6.5 per cent due to expensive valuations and modest dividend payouts.While the report does not directly model the impact of artificial intelligence, Goldman Sachs said AI could offer further upside, with benefits likely to be broad-based rather than limited to US technology companies.The bank added that its baseline does not factor in “extreme shocks or blue-sky optimism”, though alternative scenarios range from 3.6 per cent to 10.5 per cent annualised returns.Despite uncertainties, Goldman Sachs said investors can anticipate favourable long-term outcomes: “We expect global equities to deliver solid long-term returns despite elevated valuations.”","The projection comes from the investment bank’s latest Global Strategy Paper titled Building Long-Term Returns: Our 10-Year Forecasts.

‘If Japan Fails…’: China Military Draws Red Line Over Taiwan; Vows To Make Tokyo Pay Heavy Price





Japan’s economy suffered its first setback in six quarters as exports faltered under US tariffs, while Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s new administration moves to assemble a large stimulus plan to steady growth.Government figures released on Monday showed that gross domestic product fell 0.4% between July and September, with the annualised decline coming to 1.8%.The Cabinet Office numbers, as per news agency AP, showed the contraction was smaller than the market had anticipated, with economists having expected a 0.6% drop.Exports were a central drag, falling 1.2% from the previous quarter after companies had rushed shipments earlier in the year to get ahead of tariff increases.On an annualised basis, exports slid 4.5% in the three-month period, while imports edged down 0.1%. Private consumption rose 0.1%.A second reading of the same quarter also recorded a 0.4% quarter-on-quarter fall, marking the first contraction since early 2024.The April-June period was revised up to a growth of 0.6% from an initial 0.5%.Takaichi, who became the country’s first woman prime minister in October, has directed ministers to prepare a stimulus package that finance minister Satsuki Katayama said would be “well above” 17 trillion yen, according to local media cited by news agency AFP.Reports said cabinet approval is expected on Friday.Economists differed on how serious the downturn might be. As quoted by AFP, BNP Paribas’ Ryutaro Kono argued there was no need to view the negative quarter as “particularly serious”, pointing to a rebound in September exports and steady corporate investment appetite.But Capital Economics’ Marcel Thieliant warned that tensions with China — triggered by Takaichi’s recent remarks on Taiwan — risked escalating into a damaging trade dispute.As per Reuters, the 1.8% annualised fall was milder than the 2.5% contraction economists had predicted. Housing investment weakened after new energy-efficiency rules took effect in April, and higher US tariffs on Japanese goods sharply reduced shipments.Automakers, in particular, saw exports drop after earlier front-loading, though Reuters said companies largely absorbed the tariff impact through price cuts.Trade continued to weigh on growth, with net external demand subtracting 0.2 percentage points from GDP after contributing positively in the previous quarter, according to Reuters.The US and Japan implemented a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese imports in September, replacing prior duties of 27.5% on autos and 25% on other goods.Capital spending increased by 1% — far above expectations — while consumption stayed positive but modest.Economic revitalisation minister Minoru Kiuchi said in a statement, quoted by Reuters, that private consumption had now risen for six consecutive quarters and that capital expenditure had also continued to strengthen, supporting Japan’s “moderate recovery path”.Private-sector forecasts collected by the Japan Center for Economic Research show economists expect a rebound in the final quarter of the year, projecting growth of around 0.6%.The downturn has also strengthened arguments for Takaichi’s planned stimulus, with advisers citing the weak quarter as justification for a large package.Nomura Securities economist Uichiro Nozaki was quoted by Reuters as saying that measures planned from late winter to spring should improve households’ real income conditions, supporting spending early next year.","Gross domestic product fell 0.4% between July and September, with the annualised decline coming to 1.8%.

Donald Trump Signals Harsh Sanctions On Russia’s Trading Partners With India On List For Oil Trade





US President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind a new wave of hard-hitting sanctions aimed at isolating Russia, warning that countries maintaining trade ties with Moscow—and potentially Iran—will be “very severely sanctioned. ”Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump said he supported congressional efforts to advance tougher penalties on Russia and President Vladimir Putin. “I hear they're doing that, and that’s okay with me,” he said.He added that Republicans were “passing legislation... very tough sanctioning... on any country doing business with Russia,” noting, “They may add Iran to that... I suggested it.”“So any country that does business with Russia will be very severely sanctioned. We may add Iran to the formula,” added Trump.The administration has already imposed some of the steepest tariffs in the world, including a 50 per cent duty on India and a 25 per cent tariff tied to its purchases of Russian energy.On Capitol Hill, senators are pushing for even stronger measures. A bill introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham calls for a 500 per cent tariff on secondary purchases and reselling of Russian oil, a proposal with broad support in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Graham and Senator Richard Blumenthal have also put forward the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, which seeks secondary tariffs and sanctions on “countries that continue to fund Putin’s barbaric war in Ukraine"". The legislation has secured 85 Senate cosponsors, reported PTI.In a joint statement released in July, the senators said, “President Trump and his team have made a powerful move, implementing a new approach to end this bloodbath between Russia and Ukraine... However, the ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries, like China, India and Brazil, that prop up Putin’s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.”","US President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind a new wave of hard- hitting sanctions aimed at isolating Russia.

Crude prices edge lower as Russia restarts exports

Asian markets started the week on a weak note, with investors turning cautious amid fading expectations of a US rate cut and rising concerns over stretched tech valuations.The uncertain mood also spilled over into cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin briefly dipping below its end-2023 level.As per news agency AFP, traders are increasingly doubtful the Federal Reserve will cut rates next month after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that another reduction was “not certain”, while other policymakers have also suggested they may pause.Inflation staying above the Fed’s 2% target has added to those nerves. Markets are now waiting for delayed US jobs and inflation data, held up by the record government shutdown.A fragile lead from Wall Street meant most Asian bourses slipped. Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney and Singapore were lower, while Seoul, Manila and Taipei managed gains, according to AFP.Tokyo also fell after data showed Japan’s economy contracted 0.4% in the September quarter. Tourism and retail firms were hit hard after China advised its citizens against travelling to Japan following a diplomatic row over remarks by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi about Taiwan.As per AFP, Shiseido sank 9%, Takashimaya more than 5%, and Fast Retailing over 4%.In Australia, the ASX slipped to a four-month low after BHP dropped 0.7% following a British court ruling over a Brazilian dam collapse.Across markets, attention remains fixed on Nvidia’s earnings this week. The chipmaker, which became the first company to cross a $5 trillion valuation this month, has been central to the AI-fuelled surge. Concerns are rising about a possible bubble.Fiona Cincotta of City Index warned that investors are questioning “the amount of money companies are spending on the tech relative to the returns”.Expectations for a December US rate cut have dropped from over 60% last week to around 40%. US 10-year Treasury yields held at 4.156% in Tokyo. The delayed US jobs report arrives Thursday, though Reuters noted it may be “too stale” to shift market thinking.Bitcoin also weakened, with a fall to $92,935 — below its end-December finish — after climbing earlier this year on optimism linked to Donald Trump’s return to the White House.Oil prices slipped in early Asian trade on Monday after Russia resumed loadings at the key Novorossiysk export terminal following a two-day shutdown caused by a Ukrainian attack, reported Reuters.Brent crude fell 0.9% to $63.81 a barrel, while US WTI dropped 1% to $59.50.Both benchmarks had risen more than 2% on Friday after exports were halted at Novorossiysk and a nearby Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal, collectively disrupting around 2% of global supply.While shipments have restarted, Ukraine’s continued strikes on Russian refineries — including Ryazan and Novokuibyshevsk — have kept the market on alert.Analyst Toshitaka Tazawa of Fujitomi Securities was quoted as saying by Reuters that traders are weighing the long-term risks to Russia’s exports while also taking profits after Friday’s rally.He added that expectations of oversupply from OPEC+ production increases remain, with WTI likely to hover around $60 within a $5 band.As per Reuters, Western sanctions remain a key watchpoint, with the US banning dealings with Russian oil firms Lukoil and Rosneft after November 21. President Donald Trump said Republicans are preparing legislation to penalise any country trading with Russia, adding that Iran could be included.Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to increase December output targets by 137,000 barrels per day and to pause further hikes in the first quarter of next year.Meanwhile, US drillers added three oil rigs last week, bringing the total to 417.","Asian markets start the week on a weak note, with investors turning cautious amid fading expectations of a US rate cut and rising concerns over stretched tech valuations.

"When will Americans receive $2,000 tariff dividends? Donald Trump speaks out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/when-will-americans-get-2000-tariff-dividends-donald-trump-speaks-out/articleshow/125371512.cms,"‘FOOLS’: Trump Promises To Pay $2,000 Tariff Cheque To Americans, Sends Shockwaves In US

Rebate for families making less than $100,000



President Donald Trump has said Americans could see $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026, but no exact date has been set yet, although he hinted at the timeline.The payments are expected to come from revenue raised through tariffs.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said the checks will not arrive in time for the Christmas shopping season. “It will be next year. The tariffs allow us to give a dividend. We’re going to do a dividend and we’re also going to be reducing debt,” he said.The MAGA chief first floated the idea of tariff dividends earlier this month, suggesting that high-income earners would be excluded, though he did not define a specific income threshold. Trump said his Truth Social platform, “A dividend of at $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone. Those against the tariffs are FOOLS!”Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained last week that the administration was still discussing income limits. “Well, there are a lot of options here that the president’s talking about a $2,000 rebate and those — that would be for families making less than, say, $100,000,” Bessent told Fox & Friends, later clarifying that no final decision had been made.The plan faces legal hurdles. The US Supreme Court has questioned the legality of Trump’s tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, raising the possibility that some could be struck down.Trump acknowledged that if the Court rejects the tariffs, “Then I’d have to do something else.” The payments would also require congressional approval, with some Republicans sceptical and urging a focus on reducing the federal deficit.Trump’s tariffs, including IEEPA tariffs, have raised around $90 billion since implementation, with all tariffs taking in $195.9 billion in fiscal 2025. Analysts estimate that if the $2,000 dividend were limited to individuals earning under $100,000, the cost would be about $300 billion, according to the New York Post.Trump has repeatedly argued that tariffs are a tool to rebalance trade and support American businesses. Treasury Secretary Bessent said the tariffs are intended to create a “perfect storm” for rebalancing trade rather than merely raising revenue.The GOP leader remains committed to the idea of sending checks to Americans. “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,” he posted on Truth Social.","President Donald Trump has said Americans could see $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying





Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

He added, “I am confident… that China will honor their agreements,” referring to commitments made during the Trump–Xi meeting.However, Bessent cautioned that Washington has “lots of levers” if Beijing fails to keep its word.Under the emerging arrangement, rare earths “will flow freely as they did before April 4,” when China imposed new export licence requirements in retaliation for Trump’s sweeping tariffs.As part of the broader understanding reached by both leaders, the United States will roll back some tariffs on Chinese goods, and China will resume large-scale purchases of American soybeans — at least 12 million metric tons this year and 25 million metric tons in 2026.China had halted soybean imports earlier in response to Trump’s tariff actions. “They made pawns out of our great soybean farmers,” Bessent said, adding, “But we believe we have remedied that.”","Deal includes a one-year suspension of Chinese export restrictions on critical minerals.

Scheduled to begin operations in 2028, the plant is expected to play a “greater strategic role in both the global semiconductor supply chain and South Korea’s domestic chip ecosystem.”Samsung Electronics, already one of the world’s largest memory-chip makers, has seen profits jump more than 30% year-on-year in the third quarter, fuelled by AI-driven demand for high-performance chips. Rival SK hynix, also a key global player, continues to benefit from similar trends.Samsung SDS, the group’s IT and logistics arm, will build two AI data centres in South Jeolla and Gumi.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

"Find less costly ways to address pension concerns instead of OPS, says Raghuram Rajan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/find-less-costly-ways-to-address-pension-concerns-instead-of-ops-says-raghuram-rajan/articleshow/98457871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme and suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.Rajan further said the old pension scheme does involve massive future outlays because of the indexation of pensions to current salaries.""This is an enormous obligation, not necessarily in the short run, but in the long run,"" he said, adding obviously, state governments have to think through the long-term implications for government finances, and whether civil servants are the most in need of help among the constituencies they deal with.Rajan, currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said as he understands it, it may be infeasible technically or legally to move back to the old pension scheme.""If so, there may be less costly ways of addressing the concerns that prompt such moves,"" Rajan told PTI in an email interview.In a major move, a select group of central government employees have been given a one-time option to opt for old pension scheme.The employees who joined the central government services against posts advertised or notified before December 22, 2003, the day National Pension System ( NPS ) was notified, are eligible to join the old pension scheme under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021).Under Old Pension Scheme (OPS), employees get a defined pension. An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme. He suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.

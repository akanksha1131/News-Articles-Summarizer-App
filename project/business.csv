About Swiggy

Swiggy IPO : Food delivery and quick commerce platform Swiggy’s IPO worth Rs 11,324 crore opens today. It consists of Rs 4,500 crore fresh issue and remaining as an offer for sale.

Despite these challenges, India's quick commerce potential makes this IPO attractive for long-term investors, though business execution risks persist, the analysis says.Market analysts have diverse opinions regarding the Swiggy IPO, considering the company's present financial condition, market competition, and valuation metrics.

What will Donald Trump as US President mean for Indian stock markets? Top advantages & disadvantages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-will-donald-trump-as-us-president-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-top-advantages-disadvantages/articleshow/115005808.cms,"India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

How do you see the

Indian market?

As a consultant, if you were to advise the Indian govt, what would be your strategy to position India?

Vietnam and Mexico have emerged as attractive options for investment as part of the China+1 strategy. Where does India fit?

Supplementary or

complementary?

Which sectors would these be?

You work with clients on the supply chain. In the last four years, is there a significant shift in the supply chain from China?

Will the US election results and Trump’s win speed

up things?

Where do you see India figuring in all this?

Which sectors could be positive for India?

Robert Willen, the global managing partner and chairman of Kearney, has been coming to India over the last two decades. After taking the top job at the consulting firm in May 2024, Willen has spent the last couple of months meeting clients and colleagues amid renewed interest in India as companies look to diversify their supply chains beyond China, especially in sectors such as defence and telecom. Excerpts:I have been seeing incredible growth in India and we see a great potential here. There’s a domestic market, it’s not just a service market for the rest of the world. That’s a pivot we want to make in a much stronger way to really serve the domestic market, which is part of the growth of India, the aspiration of India, the positioning of India.This is a new era of industrial policy — govts are working with industry, the investor community, making choices, establishing priorities, creating a regulatory framework, attracting investments. Even the US has offered incentives to have local indigenous semiconductor production. Govts need to do that. It doesn’t mean it is for govt to do everything, but it means making some choices, establishing priorities, and investing in different ways to stimulate economic growth and development.Vietnam has advantages because it is close to China, probably replicating China most efficiently. For instance, if an American company wants to have an operation in Mexico, it’s not that it is replacing China, but it might also be thinking about resilience, speed to market, late-stage customisation, sustainability. It’s about having different sources of supply, different centres to serve customers.Probably complementary. For some, in sensitive areas, it would be replacing. (There) we see our clients wanting to move out of China entirely.More security-sensitive sectors such as defence and telecom. These are areas where backup is needed, resilience is needed. The concern about the South China Sea and Taiwan is causing many to look for alternatives.It’s still early, very early. The global shipping trends still show the strength of China; it’s coming down slowly. But we know from our discussions with clients how much they’re also considering alternate sources of supply, thinking about more diversification and resilience in supply chains. All of that’s in early stages. It doesn’t happen overnight. It needs time to develop.It’s early days, but it certainly will speed it up if you just take the rhetoric at face value. We talk about deglobalisation and tariffs, a Trump administration will perhaps accelerate that.It is generally good for India. It’s a strong, capable economy which has a lot of resources. It’s an alternative to China in many different ways. The other part is that the US has a low trade deficit with India. Some of the rhetoric that comes out of Trump circles is about rectifying the trade imbalance, which is a positive for India.We are having several conversations with multinational companies which are talking about what’s the latest in India, what are the emerging opportunities and when should they start looking at the country. Many have small presence and many do not have a presence. We are seeing a lot of interest in conversations about how to scale up, particularly in manufacturing.There is a lot of dependence on China in sectors such as batteries. Pharmaceuticals is an area where India has advantages.","Robert Willen, the global managing partner and chairman of Kearney, has been coming to India over the last two decades.

MUMBAI: The recent market crash that started in Oct has left Indian investors poorer by more than half a trillion dollars. With the sensex now down nearly 10% from its all-time high in late Sept, BSE’s market capitalisation has dipped by about Rs 48.5 lakh crore (or $620 billion) to Rs 429.5 lakh crore, official data showed.On Sept 27, BSE’s market cap was at an all-time peak at about Rs 478 lakh crore. At that day’s rupee-dollar exchange rate, the bourse’s market cap was $5.7 trillion. And on Wednesday, the bourse’s market cap stood at $5.1 trillion.This massive slide in investors’ wealth came on the back of relentless selling by foreign funds which, in turn, was because of US election-related uncertainties globally. Before the election, investors globally were unsure who will be elected the president of the US. But now, after the results, investors are worried how the policies of incoming president Donald Trump would impact markets around the world.On the domestic front, weak corporate results and a surge in retail inflation reading to a 14-month high weighed on investor sentiment, market players said.Between Oct 1 and now, foreign portfolio investors have net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 1.2 lakh crore, data from NSDL and BSE showed. This translates to nearly $14 billion.Although domestic institutional investors have net pumped in over Rs 1.3 lakh crore into stock since Oct 1, unlike in FY22 and FY23, this time it has proved to be inadequate to arrest the market’s slide, a report by Axis Securities said.On Wednesday, the sensex lost 984 points or 1.3% to close at 77,691 points — a level not seen since June 24 this year. On the NSE, Nifty lost 324 points or 1.4% to close at 23,559 points.

NEW DELHI: Debt-ridden Vodafone Idea on Wednesday said its consolidated loss narrowed to Rs 7,176 crore in the Sept quarter, compared to a loss of Rs 8,747 crore in the same period a year ago, helped by an increase in tariffs.The consolidated revenue from operations increased to Rs 10,932 crore during the quarter from Rs 10,716 crore a year ago, a growth of 2%.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

NEW DELHI: Tax burden on individuals earning less than Rs 20 lakh a year, broadly described as middle class, has come down during the 10 years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led govt, while there has been a substantial increase in taxes paid by those having annual income above Rs 50 lakh, sources said on Wednesday.As per the income tax return (ITR) filing data, the number of individuals showing annual income of over Rs 50 lakh has gone up to over 9.4 lakh in 2023-24, a five-fold jump from nearly 1.9 lakh in 2013-14. Also, the income tax liability of those earning above Rs 50 lakh has gone up 3.2 times, from over Rs 2.5 lakh crore in 2014, to Rs 9.6 lakh crore in 2024. A source said that 76% of income tax collected is from those earning above Rs 50 lakh a year. This has led to reduced tax burden on the middle class.Also, the increase in number of people filing ITRs with annual income above Rs 50 lakh is due to “strong anti tax evasion and black money laws implemented by the Modi govt”, the source added. The source further said that in 2014, individuals earning above Rs 2 lakh a year had to pay income tax. However, because of various exemptions and deductions announced by the Modi govt, individuals earning up to Rs 7 lakh need not pay any taxes.The percentage of income tax collection from taxpayers earning less than Rs 10 lakh has reduced, from nearly 10.2% of the total tax paid in 2014, to around 6.2% in 2024.According to the source, the income tax liability of those earning between Rs 2.5 and Rs 7 lakh was an average Rs 43,000 in 2023-24, which is around 4-5% of their income.","Tax burden on individuals earning less than Rs 20 lakh a year has come down during the 10 years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led govt.

MUMBAI: The trade receivables discounting system ( TReDS ) has been instrumental in addressing the long-standing issue of delayed payments for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It has offered a much-needed boost to their cash flows and addressed their financing requirements, according to RBI deputy governor Michael Patra.TReDS is an online platform that helps small businesses (MSMEs) in India get paid faster for their invoices. It’s an online marketplace where they can sell their unpaid invoices (receivables) to financiers (banks, NBFCs, etc) at a discounted rate. This gives them quick access to working capital , which is crucial for their growth and operations.Patra said that MSMEs often face cash flow challenges due to delayed payments from larger buyers. This impacts their ability to reinvest in their businesses, manage day-to-day operations, and scale up.“TReDS has effectively bridged the credit gap by enabling MSMEs to promptly convert their trade receivables into liquid funds. This ensures that small businesses do not have to wait endlessly for payments,” he said, adding, “This competitive environment helps MSMEs secure financing at rates much lower than traditional bank loans.”TReDS has helped address the credit gap of MSMEs — estimated at around Rs 52 lakh crore — by connecting them with banks and clients, reducing funding costs up to 2.5 percentage points, Patra said. “The value of invoices financed through TReDS have surged more than 23 times. As of Oct 2024, around 5,000 active fintechs are involved in providing various financial and technical solutions to businesses, including MSMEs, helping businesses better manage their operations and improve supply chain finance,” Patra said.","TReDS is an online platform that helps small businesses in India get paid faster.

BENGALURU: Industrial and automation companies showed diverse salary structures, with several firms offering compensation packages at the conservative end of the spectrum. Salary hikes in industrial and automation sectors show wide disparity amid economic pressures.During the 2023-24 financial year, some firms experienced an even more pronounced decline in wage increases. Whilst employees received minimal raises, senior executives at certain organisations continued to receive substantially higher compensation compared to their workforce. The situation remained challenging at other firms as well, with modest increments being the norm.At Bosch India , employees got a meagre 0.6% hike in FY24, while managerial personnel got an average increment of 10.5%. On the contrary, Guruprasad Mudlapur, president of Bosch Group in India, got a 15.5% hike during the same period, taking home over Rs 3 crore.The company has over 5,000 employees in India. Engineering services company Honeywell Automation India’s annual report showed employees salaries dropped 0.8% in FY24, but key managerial personnel received an 8% increment. Its India MD, Ashish Gaikwad’s remuneration increased by 12% to Rs 63.7 crore. At Cummins India, its MD Ashwath Ram’s compensation reached Rs 6.2 crore following a 20% merit increase plus a 10% market adjustment in FY24. Its employees received an average 12.4% increase.3M India presented a different scenario, with its MD Ramesh Ramadurai’s increment matching other employees. Schneider Electric Infrastructure provided average salary increases of 10.3% in 2023-24. “Product companies need capital-intensive investments, which can sometimes influence their salary budgets differently from service firms,” Sachin Alug, CEO of talent solutions firm NLB Services, said.Krishna Vij, Teamlease digital’s business head of IT staffing, said increases in salaries of key management personnel reflect a talent retention strategy .","At Bosch India, employees got a meagre 0.6% hike in FY24, while managerial personnel got an average increment of 10.5%.

NEW DELHI: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is going to move the ministry of corporate affairs for a review of the National Financial Reporting Authority’s decision to amend Standards of Audit (SA) 600 and SA 299, arguing it is not feasible to ‘blindly adopt’ global standards in the Indian context.“They are citing a few abrasions to seek these changes. If someone (auditor) is negligent, it doesn’t mean the standard is wrong. We have said that in these years you should not regret concentration of work in the hands of a few large firms and frauds should not increase,” a senior ICAI functionary said, a day after NFRA voted in favour of recommending changes, which will be notified by MCA.The official said views were similar on 38 of the 40 standards but argued that there were several member countries of the International Federation of Accountants, including India, China and the US, which only adopted the standards partially. “Given the diversity in India, carveouts are needed.

DEHRADUN: Six youngsters, including three women, died and one was critically injured after their speeding multi-utility vehicle collided with a container truck near ONGC Chowk in Dehradun around 1.30am on Monday night.Guneet Singh, 19, Kamakshi Singhal, 20, Navya Goyal, 23, Rishabh Jain, 24, and Atul Agrawal, 24 - all residents of Dehradun - and Kunal Kukreja, 23, from Himachal's Chamba, died on the spot. The injured driver, Siddhesh Agrawal, 25, also from Dehradun, is battling for life in hospital.A police officer privy to the investigation told TOI that CCTV footage and statements of passersby suggest that the MUV was at a speed of over 100kmph.The officer said the impact of the accident was so severe that the roof of the MUV was ripped off the vehicle, decapitating two passengers. The MUV has turned into mangled metal junk. ""The youngsters were returning from a party hosted by Siddhesh. The truck driver, who fled from the scene abandoning his vehicle, seems to be at no fault,"" he said.Referring to findings from the initial investigation, he said, ""The MUV - which in all likelihood was new and did not have number plates - was travelling towards Garhi Cantt from Ballupur Chowk when ""a luxury overtook them at high speed. The MUV driver then tried to accelerate to catch up with the car, as a container truck was crossing the intersection at a normal pace,"" the officer said.He added, ""The MUV driver misjudged the timing, thinking he could also cross the intersection before the truck, which was heading towards Kaulagarh from Kishangarh Chowk, had passed. As a result, the MUV collided with the truck's left side from behind.""He added that five of the deceased residents hailing from Dehradun belonged to well-to-do business families. Three of them, including two women aged 19 and 20, were students at a private university in the city, while one was an alumnus of an engineering institute.

""It was coming towards us at high speed. I managed to manoeuvre my car to avoid a head-on crash. I immediately drove towards the police personnel at the barricade near the Mussoorie diversion on Rajpur Road and asked them to stop the car.

With the current market gains for Bitcoin and other crypto assets, investors are expecting a good bull run in the 2025 cycle. Most analyses suggest that the upcoming bull run would kickstart from Bitcoin dominance. This is why many altcoins are on the rise, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), TRON , Bonk, Uniswap , Dogecoin, and Toncoin . This growth will stem from the decentralised economy to meme coins and will surely build up momentum for the next cycle.Rexas Finance (RXS) is raising capital by centering its business around the idea of adapting real-world physical assets to the blockchain. This approach appears promising, as the company has raised over $5.9 million in presale funding, following a presale of the token at $0.07. Unlike purely digital crypto space projects, Rexas Finance focuses on this core value proposition. As a microcap asset, Rexas Finance’s aims are relatively more attainable for other microcap stage investors, with a focus on tapping into real estate, precious metals, and other commodity token markets, allowing a wider array of investors to participate. Rexas Finance has created an investment utility that thrives on tokenisation using their Rexas token builder. This feature allows anyone to possess physical assets, which can then be tokenised and fully put onto the blockchain.Additionally, the platform offers a launchpad for new projects, enabling them to raise funds and grow within the Rexas ecosystem, making the platform even more interesting and useful. Rexas Estate , which deals effectively with real estate, works on the tokenisation of real-world real estate investments and merges them with a more modern real estate investment strategy. The latest campaign aimed at building a large dedicated community in Rexas Finance by rewarding early participants with a $1 million giveaway has already attracted many investors, thus enhancing the visibility of the token, which in turn appeals to investors seeking a utility token bound to increase due to its real-world purpose. With these features and practical applications, Rexas Finance appears to be an option for long-term growth and value-seeking customers.TRON is particularly noted for its advocacy of self-sovereignty of content delivered to users on the network, asserting its rights in the blockchain media and entertainment space. The price of TRON, currently trading at around $0.16, has made it the network of choice for many developers and content creators looking for a network with low fees and better scalability. Its ecosystem includes various decentralised applications, allowing content creators and developers in digital entertainment to effectively use the platform. Given the increasing appetite for decentralised media, TRON has an opportunity to grow its user base and scope of applications within the ecosystem in the upcoming 2025 bull cycle.Bonk is a recently launched meme coin that has gained popularity and can be seen as a cultural trend within the crypto ecosystem. Currently valued at $0.000022, Bonk combines the fun and entertainment aspects of a meme coin while also addressing potential use cases in the DeFi marketplace, giving it an edge over other coins. The intersection of the token’s strong network effects and the potential use of the coin within decentralised finance could help the token stay relevant and grow as demand for these types of coins increases.Uniswap has established itself as a key market client in decentralised finance, and its UNI tokens have become handy in the DeFi space. Currently trading at a price of closer to $9.20 and a little over 4.1 billion in terms of valuation, Uniswap still holds a position in the DEX protocol primarily because it allows its users to swap tokens from their wallets instead of having to use a centralised exchange. As DeFi continues to grow in number of users, it is reasonable to say that the amount of trades on UNI will also rise along with the usage of the platform.Although it began as a meme, it now has a market cap of $23 billion and a value of $0.19. Its primary utility today is as a digital currency, but its wide acceptance and use in retail and payment settings allow it to compete seriously with several global currencies. The highest growth potential for Dogecoin still seems ahead, largely thanks to strong community support.Toncoin, originating from Telegram’s blockchain, has become a major player in the DeFi space. Its current market cap is $4.71 billion, with a price of 12.9 billion tokens, which enables users to conduct high-speed transactions at low costs. Toncoin’s focus on expansion and enhancing user experience suggests it will remain key in meeting the rising demand for DeFi services.When trading tokens, each one has its own identity and purpose, whether it's Rexas Finance, TRON, Bonk, Uniswap, Dogecoin, or Toncoin. RXS’s real-world asset tokenisation model distinguishes it from others as a utility-focused project with high growth potential. As the 2025 bull run approaches, these six coins provide opportunities across various sectors—from real asset tokenisation and meme coin culture to DeFi. Early investors may want to keep a close watch on these tokens, as they are poised to bring significant returns and unique value propositions to the blockchain industry.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the website and the whitepaper X and Telegram","Many altcoins are on the rise, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), TRON, Bonk, Uniswap, Dogecoin, and Toncoin.

The Rexas Finance token (RXS) is capturing attention with its strong price projections in the crypto market . This digital asset promises significant returns, fueled by innovative real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation strategies . Investors eyeing 2025 could see the RXS token reach $10, marking an impressive 5,000% increase from its launch. By 2030, experts project RXS to climb to $40, representing a remarkable 20,000% rise. Looking to 2040, the token is anticipated to exceed $100, driven by broad adoption across various asset classes, including real estate, commodities, and digital investments.Rexas Finance is revolutionising access to real-world asset markets. Through blockchain technology , it is transforming ownership by enabling users to tokenise high-value assets like real estate, gold, and more. Imagine an investor in Asia owning a percentage of an apartment in Europe or a fraction of a retail property in the US, with potential passive income from rentals and asset appreciation. Rexas Finance empowers this transformation with key tools like the Rexas Token Builder, allowing users to tokenise assets from real estate to precious metals. The platform’s QuickMint Bot, accessible on Telegram and Discord, streamlines this process further, simplifying token creation for users regardless of technical knowledge.Expanding its asset tokenisation vision, Rexas Finance also supports entrepreneurs and startups through its Launchpad, a platform for raising capital. With this feature, creators can launch their tokens and reach investors directly, bypassing traditional funding obstacles. This democratisation of finance allows a broader pool of projects to emerge, whether in real estate, commodities, or other investment areas. The Launchpad offers opportunities for public involvement in ventures traditionally dominated by institutional investors, fueling the wider adoption of blockchain-based investments. The progress of theRXS presale underscores investor interest, with the first four stages raising $5.45 million. Currently priced at $0.07 in stage five, the presale has now raised a total of $5,697,681. RXS has achieved a 2.3x price increase since stage one, and investors entering this stage are positioned for a potential 2.8x return on launch. Notably, the decision to bypass venture capital funding in favour of a public presale has enabled wider access to this ambitious project. With Rexas Finance now listed on major data tracking platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, it gains visibility across the crypto market, bolstering credibility and user participation. The RXS token will also be listed on 3 of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, further boosting its visibility.At the heart of RXS is a comprehensive ecosystem supporting tokenised assets across industries. Rexas Estate exemplifies this expansion, offering tokenised property investments with options for fractional ownership . This model democratises real estate, previously accessible mainly to high-net-worth individuals, by allowing smaller investors to benefit from property investments with minimal capital. The platform’s tools, such as Rexas GenAI and Rexas AI Shield, add a layer of innovation, enhancing data protection and operational efficiency. Rexas GenAI powers automated insights and asset management solutions, while Rexas AI Shield focuses on security, ensuring a trustworthy investment environment. Together, these features create an ecosystem where traditional assets meet blockchain, enhancing accessibility, security, and ownership for users globally.Rexas Finance is at the forefront of a financial revolution, transforming how assets are accessed and owned in the crypto market. Combining the accessibility of fractional ownership with the security of blockchain redefines investment in real estate, commodities, and digital assets . With promising projections of $10 in 2025, $40 in 2030, and over $100 in 2040, RXS positions itself as a dynamic and compelling asset for investors. The platform’s ongoing innovations and presale momentum make RXS a valuable entry into the world of digital finance, inviting investors to seize this opportunity for significant future returns.","The Rexas Finance token (RXS) is capturing attention with its strong price projections in the crypto market.

Stretched rally

Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally took the digital asset past $89,000 and lifted the overall value of the crypto market above its pandemic-era peak as traders bet on a boom under US President-elect Donald Trump The largest token has jumped about 32% since the US election on November 5 and hit an all-time high of $89,599 early on Tuesday. The original cryptocurrency changed hands at $89,165 as of 9:25 am in Singapore.Trump has vowed friendlier crypto rules and his Republican Party is tightening its grip on Congress to push through his agenda. Other pledges include setting up a strategic US Bitcoin stockpile and boosting domestic mining of the token.His stance is a sharp break from a crackdown on the divisive industry by the Securities & Exchange Commission under President Joe Biden ’s administration. The shift has energized speculative buying of large and small tokens alike, raising the value of digital assets to about $3.1 trillion, CoinGecko data show.Bitcoin is in “beast mode,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, wrote in a note. “The question for traders not already set is whether there is still room to chase this red-hot play or wait for a slight retracement and for some of the heat to come out of the impulsive trend.”In the options market, investors are lining up bets that Bitcoin will pass $100,000 as soon as the end of the year, according to data from the Deribit exchange. Meanwhile, software firm MicroStrategy Inc. — the largest publicly-traded corporate holder of Bitcoin outside the exchange-traded fund sector — bought about 27,200 Bitcoin for some $2 billion between October 31 and November 10.Traders for now are paying little heed to questions such as how quickly Trump will implement his agenda or whether a strategic stockpile is a realistic step.Bitcoin has more than doubled so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US ETFs and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the token exceeds the returns from investments such as global stocks and gold.Fairlead Strategies LLC technical analyst Katie Stockton in her latest research note said “it would be natural to see a period of digestion after such a steep run-up,” recommending a “short-term neutral bias.”Digital-asset companies spent heavily during the US election campaign to boost candidates viewed as favorable to their interests. Against that backdrop, Trump did an about-face, becoming a supporter of an industry he once labeled a scam.His backing turned Bitcoin into one of a range of so-called Trump trades. Others include US stocks and the dollar, both of which have also been advancing given Trump’s focus on domestic economic growth, tax cuts and protectionist tariffs.","The largest token has jumped about 32% since the US election on November 5.

Rising beyond the $160 level and gaining 13% over the past month, Solana (SOL) has shown fortitude. Due to its scalability and cheap transaction costs, Solana's total value locked (TVL) of $5.4 billion places it as a key competitor in the crypto industry, despite complaints regarding its centralising tendency. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance's presale, which sold over 114 million tokens in the past two months and drawn many investors with its creative strategy, has created a buzz. This has left crypto aficionados wondering: Can Solana reach $500, and what is the secret behind the presale numbers of Rexas Finance?With a weekly gain of 2.4%, Solana (SOL) has been creating waves; its price now exceeds the $160 barrier level to $165.97. Sol is under observation by traders and analysts since breaking above $160 could indicate continuous positive momentum. By the end of this month, some analysts estimate SOL might be worth $180. Technically, Solana's performance is reinforced by various indicators. Strong buying interest would be shown if SOL could cross its annual VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and the crucial support level of $154. With estimates of over 100 million Solana wallets, the network's activity also recently underwent a spike. But since many of these wallets are empty, questions have surfaced over possible bot activity raising the network's measurements.Projections of SOL reaching $500 are highly pessimistic. Reaching this level requires SOL to overcome a sequence of important resistance levels, which could take a while. Solana's development has been noteworthy, especially with its rise from $22 to $120 over a year ago, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain the momentum needed to attain such high valuations in the distant future.While Solana draws interest, crypto billionaires and investors are also looking at Rexas Finance, a venture with record-breaking presale levels.Rising as a major competitor in the crypto space, Rexas Finance presents significant short-term profits when compared to more established initiatives like Solana. With Stage 4 alone bringing over $5.4 million and an amazing 130% return for early supporters in just two months, the presale for the project has attracted great interest. This expansion has attracted attention to Rexas Finance's creative strategy, presenting a special chance for investors. At its present price of $0.07, investors demonstrate great interest in the token, so the current presale stage 5 is presently 74% complete. With 114,732,875 tokens sold out of a targeted 155,000,000 and a total of $5,781,319 raised thus far out of a projected $8.6 million. This increase in demand demonstrates general belief in the project's ability to challenge established markets with a fresh vision for blockchain uses.Other elements driving the presale performance of Rexas Finance have been found by crypto experts. Recently, the site started a millionaire giveaway with a $1 million prize pool worth of RXS tokens. Twenty fortunate winners will get RXS tokens valued $50,000 apiece. Users must interact with the community to raise their chances of winning and enter their ERC20 wallet address on the Rexas Finance website (rexas.com). Particularly considering plans to offer the RXS token on three top-tier exchanges at a listing price of $0.20 in the first quarter of 2025, Rexas Finance has a bright future. For Stage 5 investors, this action promises a possible 186% increase; early supporters might see gains of more than 330%. Analysts estimate that considering the demand for the RXS token, it might rally up to 12000% by the end of 2025, therefore confirming its revolutionary nature in the crypto industry.Solana shows resiliency, but Rexas Finance makes a strong argument for those looking for quick gains. Rexas Finance seems poised to generate significant gains that could exceed even Solana's remarkable increase with its consistent presale performance, creative platform, and strategic listing policies.","Solana (SOL) has been creating waves; its price now exceeds the $160 barrier level to $165.97. While Solana draws interest, crypto billionaires and investors are also looking at Rexas Finance, a venture with record-breaking presale levels. The presale for the project has attracted great interest.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115185670,imgsize-1000614,width-838,resizemode-4/115185670.jpg"

Budget 2026: Change in FM Sitharaman’s Budget speech format? What Part B may now hold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-change-in-fm-sitharamans-budget-speech-format-whats-part-b-may-now-hold/articleshow/127831252.cms,"Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Union Budget 2026 is just hours away and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman might use Part B of her budget speech to put forward the country’s long term vision for investors.The Part A has traditionally carried core policy measures and economic announcements, while Part B has been limited largely to taxation. This year year’s speech, however, may be a clear shift, according to sources cited by ET. FM Sitharaman is expected to place more weight on Part B, going away from a format that has been followed for decades.According to sources, the section will cover both near-term economic priorities and long-term structural ambitions, providing a clearer sense of where the economy is headed. It is also expected to set out the government’s economic thinking in the context of changing global and domestic conditions.Part B will not be confined to tax proposals but will include a broader strategic outline aimed at boosting India’s standing. The narrative is expected to highlight domestic strengths, existing economic capacity and future growth prospects, alongside the policy path required to maintain progress. “The idea is to lay out a broader, long-term vision,” a government official told ET.The timing of the shift is linked to current geopolitical uncertainties, including higher tariffs imposed by the US.The government intends to use the budget speech to present a long-term policy message that offers reassurance to foreign investors.The Economic Survey, presented in Parliament earlier this week, had highlighted the need for a multi-pronged strategy to improve the investment environment by tackling both structural and cyclical issues. It also pointed to the importance of emphasising India’s stability, macroeconomic strength, sustained growth and large market size, noting that foreign direct investment inflows have yet to reach their full potential despite the government’s stated intent and track record in economic management.",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman might use Part B of her budget speech to put forward the country’s long term vision for investors.

FM Nirmala Sitharaman opts for a Kanjeevaram saree from Tamil Nadu on Budget Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-opts-for-a-kanjeevaram-saree-from-tamil-nadu-on-budget-day/articleshow/127832134.cms,"Nirmala Sitharaman poses with her team ahead of Budget speech

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget for the financial year 2026–27 in the Lok Sabha today, marking her ninth consecutive Budget presentation.While attention will be on revenue projections, fiscal discipline and spending priorities, Sitharaman’s Budget Day appearance also attracts interest for another reason — her saree. Over the years, the finance minister has consistently chosen handloom sarees for the occasion, using the high-profile moment to spotlight India’s traditional textiles and artisan communities, in line with the government’s “Vocal for Local” push.Ahead of the presentation, Sitharaman posed with her Budget team outside her office at Kartavya Bhavan. This year, the finance minister opted for a magenta Kanjeevaram saree from Tamil Nadu and paired with a yellow blouse and a woollen shawl.In her hands, she carried a tablet enclosed in a red pouch bearing the national emblem, accompanied by the minister of state and the six secretaries of her ministry, underscoring the continued shift to a paperless Budget format.Last year, Sitharaman had opted for an off-white saree featuring Madhubani fish embroidery, gifted by Padma Shri awardee Dulari Devi of Bihar. Paired with a red blouse, the saree highlighted Bihar’s folk art tradition and brought national attention to a regional craft form.Over successive Budgets, Sitharaman’s saree choices have evolved into a quiet tradition, one that brings focus on Indian handlooms and regional textiles while keeping the spotlight firmly on the Budget itself.","Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget for the financial year 2026–27 in the Lok Sabha today.

US President Donald Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff policies have created an “American economic miracle”, dismissing warnings of global fallout and asserting that critics of his trade strategy “were all wrong”.In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal, Trump said the tariffs he imposed on nearly all foreign countries last April had strengthened the US economy rather than triggering the global economic meltdown predicted by skeptics.“When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,” Trump wrote, as quoted news agency ANI. “Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!”The US president said he inherited a “ravaged economy” from his predecessor and was accused of pushing the world towards recession, but claimed those forecasts had been disproved.“Nine months later, the results are in, every one of those predictions has proven completely and totally wrong,” he wrote, adding that since his election in 2024 the US had seen 52 stock market highs.Trump asserted that the American economy was growing at 4.4 per cent with inflation at 1.4 per cent, and that real incomes for US workers had risen by between $1,000 and $2,000. He also claimed the stock market had “skyrocketed” since what he described as “Liberation Day”, saying the Dow Jones Industrial Average could soon breach the 50,000 mark.In the op-ed, Trump further claimed his administration had cut the federal budget deficit by 27 per cent in a single year and slashed the monthly trade deficit by 77 per cent, “all with virtually no inflation”.He also cited trade agreements with China, the UK, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, saying these deals had blunted retaliation against the US and strengthened economic security.Trump went on to make broader claims about the geopolitical impact of tariffs, arguing that they had bolstered US national security and even contributed to peace-making efforts. He asserted—without evidence—that tariffs had helped resolve several conflicts, including what he described as mediation between India and Pakistan.Concluding his article, Trump urged critics to acknowledge his record. “Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST’ country anywhere in the world,” he wrote, adding that skeptics should don his “favourite red hats” bearing the slogan: “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!",US President Donald Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff policies have created an “American economic miracle” He has dismissed warnings of global fallout and asserting that critics of his trade strategy “were all wrong” Trump said the tariffs he imposed on nearly all foreign countries last April had strengthened the US economy rather than triggering a global economic meltdown.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127824776,imgsize-747985,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Who is Kevin Warsh?

NEW DELHI: US president Donald Trump on Friday announced Kevin Warsh as his nominee for chairman of the US Federal Reserve, setting the stage for a contentious Senate confirmation process amid growing debate over the central bank’s independence.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, "" I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Kevin Warsh to be the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. Kevin currently serves as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution, and Lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He is a Partner of Stanley Druckenmiller at Duquesne Family Office LLC. Kevin received his A.B. from Stanford University, and J.D. from Harvard Law School. He has conducted extensive research in the field of Economics and Finance. Kevin issued an Independent Report to the Bank of England proposing reforms in the conduct of Monetary Policy in the United Kingdom. Parliament adopted the Report's recommendations. Kevin Warsh became the youngest Fed Governor, ever, at 35, and served as a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2006 until 2011, as the Federal Reserve's Representative to the Group of Twenty (G-20), and as the Board's Emissary to the Emerging and Advanced Economies in Asia. In addition, he was Administrative Governor, managing and overseeing the Board's operations, personnel, and financial performance. Prior to his appointment to the Board, from 2002 until 2006, Kevin served as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and Executive Secretary of the White House National Economic Council. Previously, Kevin was a member of the Mergers & Acquisitions Department at Morgan Stanley & Co., in New York, serving as Vice President and Executive Director. I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is “central casting,” and he will never let you down. Congratulations Kevin!""Warsh previously served as a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011 and was the youngest Fed governor at the time of his appointment. He worked closely with then Fed chair Ben Bernanke during the 2008 global financial crisis and emerged as a key link between policymakers and financial markets.Before joining the Fed, Warsh served in the White House as special assistant to the president for economic policy and executive secretary of the National Economic Council under president George W Bush. He began his career in investment banking at Morgan Stanley, where he worked in the mergers and acquisitions division.The nomination comes days after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady under current chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump again criticised, calling him a ""moron"". Trump had said he would announce his pick after the rate decision, as months of attacks on Powell have raised concerns among investors about political pressure on the central bank. US media reports said Warsh emerged ahead of other contenders, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder and Trump’s economic adviser Kevin Hassett.In recent years, Warsh has criticised the Fed for moving into political territory and argued that its policy choices have constrained economic growth. He has publicly supported interest rate cuts to boost the economy, even as Fed officials have cautioned about inflation risks, including those stemming from Trump’s tariff policies.Warsh’s appointment will require confirmation by the US Senate. The Senate Banking Committee will first review the nomination, followed by a full Senate vote. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican member of the committee, has said he will oppose any Fed nominee until an ongoing probe involving Powell is resolved.",US president Donald Trump on Friday announced Kevin Warsh as his nominee for chairman of the US Federal Reserve.

Musk meets Musk: SpaceX explores mergers with Tesla or xAI; $50 billion IPO in focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/musk-meets-musk-spacex-explores-mergers-with-tesla-or-xai-50-billion-ipo-in-focus/articleshow/127795715.cms,"(AP)

Space-based data centers and AI strategy

SpaceX IPO could be largest in history

SpaceX is exploring potential mergers with Tesla Inc or artificial intelligence startup xAI, as Elon Musk considers ways to consolidate his growing business empire.The aerospace company has held internal talks about the feasibility of a SpaceX–Tesla merger, an idea that some investors are actively encouraging, reported Bloomberg, citing sources. Separately, SpaceX is also evaluating a possible combination with xAI ahead of a potential initial public offering.No final decisions have been made, and the details of any transaction could still change.Any merger involving SpaceX could draw strong interest from infrastructure funds and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, according to people familiar with the matter. One source noted that a deal could also require a significant financing component.Different merger structures could support Musk’s broader vision for SpaceX, including placing data centers in orbit to handle advanced artificial intelligence computing.A merger between SpaceX and xAI could allow the AI company to leverage space-based computing capacity, if the technical challenges can be overcome. SpaceX has discussed the possibility of using satellites and orbital infrastructure to support large-scale AI workloads.Tesla could also play a role in this strategy. The electric vehicle maker’s energy storage systems may help power space-based data centers using solar energy. Musk has additionally discussed using SpaceX’s Starship rockets to transport Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots to the Moon and Mars.Following reports of the potential merger discussions, Tesla shares rose as much as 4.5% in after-hours trading on Thursday. The stock had declined 3.5% during regular trading, leaving Tesla with a market capitalization of approximately $1.56 trillion.Bloomberg News has previously reported that SpaceX is targeting an IPO valuation of around $1.5 trillion, potentially placing it among the most valuable companies in the world.According to Nevada business records, two legal entities containing the phrase “merger sub” were formed on January 21. Both entities list SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen as an officer, a move often associated with merger preparations.Reuters previously reported on a potential SpaceX–xAI merger, under which xAI shares would be exchanged for SpaceX stock. Some xAI executives may be offered cash in lieu of equity, according to people familiar with the proposal.SpaceX is considering a public listing as early as June, around Elon Musk’s birthday, and could seek to raise up to $50 billion, sources have said. If completed, the offering would be the largest IPO in history.Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley are expected to serve as lead underwriters. Robinhood Markets is also seeking a role in the IPO, Bloomberg News reported.In December, CFO Bret Johnsen told employees that a SpaceX IPO would help fund an “insane flight rate” for the company’s Starship rocket and support plans for a permanent Moon base.","The aerospace company has held internal talks about the feasibility of a SpaceX–Tesla merger.

Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow. Tech stocks took a hit, while gold and silver prices dropped from their record highs. Oil prices also fell as tensions between the US and Iran showed signs of easing. The market's ups and downs this week were influenced by various factors, including a weaker dollar and Donald Trump's threats against Iran.The tech sector's earlier optimism about AI, boosted by strong earnings from Meta, Samsung, and SK hynix, took a downturn after Microsoft's announcement. The company revealed plans to increase AI infrastructure spending, which worried investors about delayed returns on investment. This news had a significant impact on Microsoft's stock.""Microsoft suffered its worst session since the Covid‑era crash, falling 12 percent and accounting for over two‑thirds of the S&P 500's decline,"" said National Australia Bank's Rodrigo Catril, as quoted by AFP. He pointed out that investors were worried about rising costs and slower growth in cloud services.Most Asian markets struggled, with Hong Kong and Shanghai dropping more than 1%.Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei, and Manila also fell, while Seoul and Wellington saw some gains. Jakarta continued to face challenges after MSCI raised concerns about ownership issues.Indian markets also opened at a low. While Nifty50 went below 25,300, BSE Sensex was down over 500 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,274.65, down 144 points or 0.57%.

The slight increase in the dollar value contributed to this decline, despite Trump's apparent comfort with a weaker US currency.Oil markets remained volatile, with prices falling more than 1% after Thursday's 5% surge. This came as Trump warned Iran about possible strikes while sending military forces to the region. However, fears persist about potential conflicts in the oil-rich area, which could drive up prices and inflation.The overall market sentiment reflects caution about tech valuations and concerns about possible market bubbles, as stocks have reached record highs in recent years largely due to tech sector growth.","Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow.

Toyota car sales climb despite US trade tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/toyota-car-sales-climb-despite-us-trade-tensions/articleshow/127767517.cms,"Japanese auto giant Toyota said on Thursday that global sales hit a new record last year, despite trade tensions, as it retained its title as the world's top automaker and widened the gap with German rival Volkswagen.Sales, including those of subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors, rose 4.6 percent to 11.3 million vehicles, the company said.That far outstripped Volkswagen's total of 8.98 million vehicles, which was down 0.5 percent from the year before.The overall increase came despite flat sales for Toyota in China, a crucial market where it faces intensifying competition from local automakers including electric-car champion BYD.US sales climbed eight percent in spite of the 25 percent tariff on Japanese auto exports imposed by Washington between April and mid-September, when a 15 percent cap kicked in.The United States is a key market where Toyota generates almost a quarter of its sales. But of the 2.52 million vehicles it sold there in 2025, only 1.39 million were produced in the country.Even so, it last year increased output by 10 percent at its factories in the United States, where it produces its increasingly popular hybrid vehicles.To keep exporting to the United States on competitive terms, Japanese automakers have had to slash prices.In early November, Toyota estimated the impact of US duties on its annual operating profit at around 1.45 trillion yen ($9.5 billion).Other Japanese automakers, meanwhile, are taking a hit.Nissan, which is in serious financial difficulty, saw sales drop 4.4 percent to 3.2 million vehicles in 2025, with a 6.3 percent collapse in its flagship Chinese market.Honda reported an almost nine percent plunge in global sales, to 3.4 million vehicles.","Sales, including those of subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors, rose 4.6 percent to 11.3 million vehicles.

"Tesla made smallest annual profit since pandemic, plans to spend big on robotaxis, robots",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-made-smallest-annual-profit-since-pandemic-plans-to-spend-big-on-robotaxis-robots/articleshow/127754813.cms,"Tesla's annual profit plunged to its lowest level since the pandemic five years ago as it lost the title of the world's biggest electric vehicle maker to a Chinese rival and boycotts hammered sales.The EV company run by Elon Musk reported Wednesday that net income last year dropped 46 per cent to USD3.8 billion. It was the second year in a row of steep declines. The drop came despite the introduction of cheaper models and Musk's promise to remain laser-focused on the company after a foray into US politics.Still, Tesla investors have kept the faith in Musk. The stock is up 9 per cent in the past year.Musk has been urging investors to focus less on car sales and more on what he considers a bright new artificial intelligence future of robotaxis ferrying millions in cars without drivers, or even steering wheels, and robots watering plants and taking care of elderly parents.On a conference call, Musk underlined that shift by announcing Tesla had decided to close down production of two older car models, S and X, in the second quarter and convert a Fremont, California, factory to produce its Optimus robots instead.Making those future ambitions a reality will take money. Officials said Tesla would spend big on AI and others new projects this year, more than doubling capital expenditures to USD 20 billion.And the company revealed it had recently invested USD 2 billion in the artificial intelligence company xAI, raising potential conflicts of interest issues as Musk holds big stakes in both companies.That AI business, known for its Grok AI assistant, has courted controversy for echoing Musk's views on race, gender, and politics and, recently, producing nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images.Tesla's fourth quarter profit also fell sharply, dropping 61 per cent to USD 840 million, or 24 cents. But excluding one-time charges, net income totalled 50 cents per share, compared to analysts' forecasts of 45 cents.""They've got aging product that is less and less competitive as other manufacturers come out with new models, then there is the general brand destruction,"" said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid. ""Musks involvement in politics has turned off customers.""There were hopeful signs in the report, too. Tesla's energy storage business, though small compared to the car sales, posted strong numbers last quarter with revenues surging 25 per cent to USD 3.8 billion reflecting demand from new datacentres sucking up energy around the US.Tesla's gross profit margins were another bright spot, leaping to 20 per cent last quarter from 16 per cent a year ago.""Tesla's ability to show improving profitably was a surprise,"" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.Goldstein said he was also encouraged by plans outlined in Tesla's earnings report to roll out robotaxi service in Houston, Miami and five other cities in the first half of this year. In the conference call, the company also said that it would begin producing its two-seated Cybercab with no wheels or pedals in the same time frame.But Musk is well know for making promises with deadlines he never meets.Musk said that European regulators would approve its partial self-driving software in the first three months last year, a potential big boost to Tesla sales there. But that hasn't happen yet. And a strong revival in sales Musk heralded midway through the year also failed to materialise.The robotaxi program has progressed slowly, which Musk told investors is due to Tesla being extremely cautious to avoid mishaps.Tesla promised robotaxi rides without anyone driving the car, but until recently the cars had supervisors inside to grab the controls in case something went wrong. Tesla has now removed the safety drivers in Austin where it launched the service in June.For some on Wall Street that is enough to keep pushing the stock up.One of Wall Street's most bullish analysts, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, expects robotaxis will be in more than 30 cities by the end of this year, and that Tesla will capture 70 per cent of the global market for self-driving cars in a decade.Ives and others are also encouraged that Musk has shifted his focus back to the company after spending months as head of a government cost-cutting team in Washington.But it's not clear his attention will remain as undivided in the new year. He has plans to take his rocket company SpaceX public, possibly in June, in what many expect to be a blockbuster IPO that make him the world's first trillionaire - but also possibly distract him.",Tesla's annual profit plunged to its lowest level since the pandemic five years ago.

Tether is shaking up gold market with massive metal hoard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tether-is-shaking-up-gold-market-with-massive-metal-hoard/articleshow/127749392.cms,".

There are roughly 370,000 nuclear bunkers in Switzerland, a legacy of the Cold War that are now rarely used. One of them, though, is a hive of activity.Every week, more than a ton of gold is hauled in to the high-security vault, owned by crypto giant Tether Holdings SA, which is now the world’s largest known hoard of bullion outside of banks and nation states. Over the past year, Tether has quietly become one of the biggest players in the global gold market — the embodiment of a meeting of the crypto and gold worlds whose shared distrust of govt debt is a major factor behind the surge in prices to never-before-seen highs above $5,200 an ounce.And yet relatively little is known about its inner workings, or its gold strategy. When two of the most senior gold traders quit leading bullion bank HSBC Holdings last year, the industry was abuzz with gossip about where they would head next; few guessed that the answer was Tether.In an interview with Bloomberg, chief executive Paolo Ardoino described the company’s role in the gold market as similar to that of a central bank, and predicted that Washington’s geopolitical rivals would launch a gold-backed alternative to the dollar.He revealed that it plans to keep ploughing its enormous profits into gold, while also beginning to compete with banks in trading the metal.“We are soon becoming basically one of the biggest, let’s say, gold central banks in the world,” he said.Even in these historic times for the gold market, Tether’s activities stand out. It has rapidly stepped up its purchases, buying over 70 tonnes of gold over the course of last year for its reserves and its own gold stablecoin, according to a Bloomberg calculation. That’s more than was reported by almost any single central bank: only Poland, which added 102 tonnes to its reserves, made larger declared purchases. It is also more than what was bought by any but the three largest exchange-traded funds, which represent the collective activity of tens of thousands of individual traders and investors.Tether holds around 140 tonnes of gold, according to Ardoino, most of which are its own reserves, along with the bullion backing its own gold token. That amount of metal is worth $24 billion, the largest known hoard outside of those held by central banks, ETFs and commercial banks whose vaults underpin the main trading hubs. Ardoino said Tether had been buying at a rate of about one to two tonnes a week, and intended to continue doing so for “definitely the next few months. ”Tether makes money from its dollar stablecoin that is the giant of the sector, with $186 billion in circulation. The company takes in real dollars in exchange for that USDT token, and invests them in Treasuries and other assets, such as gold, raking in billions in interest and trading profits.Possessing the physical metal is crucial, Ardoino said, so much so that the company has taken the unusual step of storing the bullion itself in the former nuclear bunker in Switzerland, guarded by multiple layers of thick steel doors. “It’s a James Bond kind of place,” Ardoino said.The secretive nature of the gold market means that while it’s easy to describe broad drivers of investment, it can be hard to pinpoint who exactly is buying. China, for example, officially disclosed just 27 tonnes of purchases last year, but many traders believe it bought much more.Such is the scale of Tether’s disclosed purchases, that some market watchers have pointed to their role in shifting global prices. The purchases likely contributed to gold’s 65% rally last year, analysts at Jefferies Financial Group said in a note, describing Tether as a “significant new buyer” which “could drive sustained gold demand.”"," crypto giant Tether Holdings SA is now the world’s largest known hoard of bullion outside of banks and nation states.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April. The target was fixed in the meeting of state food secretaries held alongside state food ministers' conference here to discuss procurement arrangements.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98373075,imgsize-189632,width-400,resizemode-4/98373075.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Consumption of petrol, diesel and jet fuel continued to gallop apace in February, prompted by early onset of summer and harvesting pushing up demand from the farm sector and increased mobility prompted by expanding economic activities.Early trade data shows petrol consumption rising 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago. Consumption of LPG , mostly used by households for cooking, grew maintained the usual modest growth at 2.4%.The growth in consumption was substantially higher than in the same month of 2021 when the economy began firing up after the pandemic. Compared to February 2021, petrol, diesel and jet fuel sales were higher by 15.7%, 12.1% and 41.3%, respectively.The growth in diesel sales was, however, appeared modest at 7.7% compared to February 2020 — when the pandemic was yet to squeeze demand. Since diesel a key indicator economic activities, this indicates lingering pandemic overhang.In contrast, petrol sales show a sharp uptick at 20% versus February 2020 as people’s preference for personal vehicles during the post-pandemic unlock period continues as reflected in robust automobile sales.Similarly, jet fuel sales have gradually recovered but still remains 10% short of the February 2020 level, indicating some resistance at this level. Industry is banking on the summer travel season for full recovery.Sequentially also, the sales in February were higher by 13.5% for petrol, 9.2% for diesel and just 3.3% for jet fuel, the data shows.Early onset of summer and absence of winter rains have pushed up demand from the farm sector due to increased use of diesel pumps for irrigating late standing crops such as mustard. Harvesting in states that have early harvesting further boosted the demand.","Petrol consumption rose 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago.

India's manufacturing PMI shows steady growth in February,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-manufacturing-pmi-shows-steady-growth-in-february/articleshow/98327500.cms,"NEW DELHI: The growth momentum in India's manufacturing sector was maintained in February, with new orders and output increasing at similar rates to January, according to a monthly survey. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 55.3 in February, little-changed from 55.4 in January.The February PMI data pointed to an improvement in overall operating conditions for the 20th straight month. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 indicates contraction.""India's manufacturing industry sustained robust growth of output and new orders halfway through the final fiscal quarter, albeit with a notable slowdown in the rate of international sales expansion,"" the survey released on Wednesday said.Companies signalled only mild pressure on their own operating capacities, with outstanding business increasing marginally in February and accordingly job numbers expanded only fractionally.As per the survey, 98 per cent of panellists reported no change in employment. Job creation failed to gain meaningful traction as firms reportedly had sufficient staff to cope with current requirements, said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The domestic market was the main source of new business growth, as new orders from abroad increased only fractionally. The rise in international sales was the weakest in the current 11-month period of expansion.""... most of the upturn in new orders welcomed by firms was domestically driven as international sales rose at a marginal pace that was the weakest in almost a year,"" Lima said.On the prices front, input cost inflation accelerated to a four-month high, with firms mentioning higher prices for electronic components, energy, foodstuff, metals and textiles.""After slipping to a 26-month low last November, input cost inflation surged in every month since. The latest rise was historically subdued, however, and among the weakest in around two years.""The survey showed some reluctance among manufacturers to pass on cost increase to clients, with output charge inflation easing since January,"" Lima said.Meanwhile, business confidence improved in February, with firms expecting demand strength, new product releases and investments to bode well for growth prospects.The S&P Global India Manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers.

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried, testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals.The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" He acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online.“Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN







NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","SEC sues Coinbase, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange.

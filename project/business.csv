When interest is paid—and when it is not

Why many refunds are taking longer this year

1. Mismatch between taxpayer data and department records

2. Foreign income or high-value transactions

3. Inoperative PANs, pending scrutiny or incomplete verification

New CBDT powers aimed at speeding up corrections

What taxpayers can do when refunds remain stuck

ITR filing FY 2024-25: Many taxpayers who completed their income tax return (ITR) weeks or even months ago are still waiting for their refunds despite the September 16, 2025 filing deadline having passed long ago. With bank accounts being checked daily, the tax department says the delays are tied to closer scrutiny of questionable deduction claims.Launching a taxpayers’ lounge at the India International Trade Fair (IITF), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman Ravi Agrawal said the department has already contacted individuals who may have missed key disclosures, asking them to submit revised returns. According to PTI, he added, “Low-value refunds are being released. We have analysed and found that some wrong refunds or deductions were being claimed. So, this is a continuous process. We hope to release the remaining refunds by this month or by December.”Amid the delay, experts note that taxpayers whose refunds are held up for reasons not attributable to them are entitled to statutory interest on the unpaid amount under Section 244A of the Income Tax Act.Neeraj Agarwala, Partner at Nangia & Co LLP, told ET “Under Section 244A, the department pays simple interest at 0.5% per month (6% per annum) on delayed refunds.”For ITRs filed on or before September 16, 2025, interest is calculated from April 1 until the refund is issued. For belated filings, the interest clock starts from the date the return was furnished.Interest varies depending on the type of tax paid and the timeline of payment or filing. Below is a summarised version of the department’s computation rules:Interest applies only if the delay is not caused by the taxpayer. Providing incomplete information, responding late to notices or giving incorrect details can make the taxpayer ineligible. Refunds arising from excess self-assessment tax under Section 140A also do not attract interest, and refunds below Rs 100 do not qualify.CA Mohit Gupta, Partner at PNAM & Co LLP, says, “Interest under Section 244A is payable at 6% per annum and continues to accrue for as long as the refund remains unpaid, irrespective of whether the return is taken up for scrutiny.” He notes that scrutiny proceedings themselves do not interrupt interest unless the delay is directly linked to the taxpayer.Data from the Income Tax Department as of 10 November 2025 shows a 7% year-on-year rise in net direct tax collections, but refunds have fallen by 18%. Several technical and compliance-related issues are contributing to slower processing:Gupta explains that TDS/TCS credit mismatches remain the most common trigger for delays. Errors such as incorrect TAN details, wrong section codes, outdated challans, or mismatches between gross and net interest figures frequently require manual review. Even minor inconsistencies between filings and Form 26AS, the Annual Information Statement (AIS) or the new Tax Information Statement (TIS) can flag a case for additional verification.Larger refund claims or filings that include foreign income, capital gains or multiple income streams take longer to clear. Gupta says, “Cases involving foreign income frequently see additional delays due to non-reflection of foreign tax credits. Another major source of delay is inconsistencies between ITR disclosures and data appearing in AIS/TIS.” Issues in reporting interest, dividends, capital gains, mutual fund redemptions, property deals or high-value SFT-flagged items often trigger automated alerts. Foreign asset reporting under Schedule FA is another high-risk category.Refunds are also held up when bank accounts are not pre-validated, PAN is not linked to Aadhaar or earlier tax demands remain unresolved. Returns not e-verified within 30 days become invalid until verification is completed. Gupta notes that when PAN becomes inoperative under Rule 114AAA, it disrupts every stage of processing—from TDS credit mapping to bank validation—making refunds impossible until the PAN is restored.To accelerate error resolution, the CBDT issued Notification No. 155/2025 granting the CPC Commissioner concurrent authority to rectify apparent errors and issue revised demand orders directly. Agarwala says the upgrade will help close long-pending cases faster because CPC Bengaluru no longer needs to wait for higher-level officers to issue corrections.If errors remain unaddressed or earlier rectification requests have not been processed, taxpayers may file a fresh online rectification request under Section 154. Gupta points out that the Income Tax portal’s e-Nivaran module allows users to file detailed complaints, upload supporting material and monitor progress online.Where responses remain slow, escalation through CPGRAMS often prompts quicker action because grievances are reviewed at senior administrative levels. Taxpayers may also write to their jurisdictional Assessing Officer or request a personal hearing. In situations of prolonged inaction or unjustified delays, filing a writ petition before the High Court is an available legal remedy.Refund delays can be frustrating, but the law does provide compensation where taxpayers are not at fault. Understanding how interest is calculated, ensuring accurate disclosures and using grievance channels effectively can help shorten the wait and ensure that refunds–and any interest due-reach the taxpayer sooner.","Many taxpayers who completed their income tax return (ITR) weeks or even months ago are still waiting for their refunds.

Small shareholders get priority allocation

Buyback track record and promoter stance

Infosys share buyback: IT major Infosys is set to launch its largest-ever share buyback programme worth Rs 18,000 crore on Thursday, offering shareholders a tender window until November 26. The initiative will see the IT major repurchase up to 10 crore fully paid-up equity shares of face value Rs 5 each at Rs 1,800 per share, representing as much as 2.41 per cent of its total paid-up equity capital.Announcing the details in a regulatory filing, the company said the buyback window will remain open from November 20 to November 26, 2025, PTI reported. It added that the move follows an assessment of medium-term strategic and operational cash needs while ensuring surplus funds are returned “in an effective and efficient manner in line with its capital allocation policy”.Infosys has split the buyback into a reserved category for small shareholders and a general category. Small shareholders—defined as those holding equity worth not more than Rs 2,00,000 on the record date—will receive a 15 per cent reservation or their entitlement, whichever is higher. As of the record date on November 14, 2025, there are 25,85,684 shareholders who meet this criterion.The entitlement ratio has been fixed at 2:11 for the reserved category and 17:706 for the general category.Entitlement reflects the number of shares that eligible investors can tender based on their holdings as on the record date.This marks Infosys’ fifth major share repurchase since 2017. Its first buyback, conducted eight years ago, amounted to around Rs 13,000 crore with 11.3 crore shares purchased at Rs 1,150 each, equal to 4.92 per cent of the equity base. Subsequent buybacks were valued at Rs 8,260 crore (2019), Rs 9,200 crore, and Rs 9,300 crore in 2022–23.Promoters —including Nandan M Nilekani and Sudha Murty—have chosen not to participate in this round. Together, they hold 13.05 per cent of the company’s equity as on the announcement date.Infosys said it plans to “steadily increase its annual dividend per share” and continue returning approximately 85 per cent of cumulative free cash flow over a five-year period starting FY25, using semi-annual dividends, buybacks or special dividends, subject to approvals.","IT major Infosys is set to launch its largest-ever share buyback programme worth Rs 18,000 crore on Thursday.

US SHUTDOWN OVER! Heated Debate On Healthcare In HOUSE Ends In SHOCKER For Dems | Watch

according to news agency AP

reported AP

The Federal Aviation Administration will lift all flight-reduction orders at 40 major airports from Monday, allowing airlines to return to normal operations after weeks of shutdown-triggered disruptions.In a joint statement, transportation secretary Sean Duffy and FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said regular schedules can resume from 6 am EST on Monday.The FAA had imposed the unprecedented limits from November 7 due to growing staffing shortages at air-traffic control facilities during what AP described as the country’s longest government shutdown.The cuts initially stood at 4%, rising to 6%, before being reduced to 3% on Friday as staffing improved following the shutdown’s end on November 12,Major hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta were among those affected.Cancellations fell to their lowest point this weekend, with aviation analytics firm Cirium showing fewer than 1% of flights cancelled.The FAA said its safety team recommended lifting the order after “detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events.” However, it noted reports of carrier non-compliance during the emergency period and said enforcement options were being assessed.The worst disruption came on November 9, when more than 2,900 flights were cut due to the FAA order, controller shortages and severe weather,Controllers, who worked without pay during the 43-day shutdown, had missed two paychecks.According to NBC News, staffing levels have now “stabilised,” enabling the emergency order to end.Staffing-trigger events dropped sharply—from 81 on November 8 to just one on Sunday.Other restrictions, such as limits on visual flight rule approaches and commercial space launches, will also end.Under the original emergency order, reductions were set to climb to 10%, but officials froze them at 6% on Wednesday before scaling them down to 3% on Friday.Duffy said the agency can now “refocus” on controller hiring and building a “state-of-the-art air traffic control system the American people deserve.”","The Federal Aviation Administration will lift all flight-reduction orders at 40 major airports from Monday.

It was last trading at $92,891 after hitting an intraday low of $89,286.75, reported Reuters.Data from CoinGecko shows the broader digital asset universe has seen about $1.2 trillion in market value erased over the past six weeks. Traders attribute the slide to uncertainty over future US interest rate cuts and a fragile mood across financial markets after an extended rally.“The cascading selloff is amplified by listed companies and institutions exiting their positions after piling in during the rally, compounding contagion risks across the market,” said Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association. He warned that “when support thins and macro uncertainty rises, confidence can erode with remarkable speed.”Market specialists said selling pressure has been persistent but is hitting at a time when the buy side looks especially weak. Joseph Edwards of Enigma Securities said many small investors have stayed away since the October crash that triggered liquidations worth $19 billion across leveraged positions.Shares of major crypto-linked firms such as Strategy, Coinbase, Riot Platforms and Mara Holdings have also fallen amid the broader risk-off tone. Standard Chartered Bank has estimated that a further decline below $90,000 could result in about half of publicly listed companies’ bitcoin holdings turning “underwater”, meaning their holdings would be valued below acquisition cost.The corporate sector collectively holds around 4 per cent of all bitcoin and 3.1 per cent of ether in circulation, according to the bank. Strategy, the largest listed holder, has continued to expand its stash. Founder Michael Saylor said the company purchased 8,178 bitcoin on Monday, taking its total to 649,870 tokens acquired at an average price of roughly $74,433 per coin.Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has also been under sustained pressure and is now down nearly 40 per cent from its August high above $4,955.“All in all, sentiment is pretty low in crypto and has been since the leverage wipeout of October,” said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital.","The world’s biggest cryptocurrency, which touched a record high above $126,000 in October, has now surrendered all its gains for 2025.

Morgan Stanley initiated its coverage on LG Electronics with an overweight rating and a target price of Rs 1,864. Analysts said the company stands out across many categories in a highly competitive consumer durables market with industry-leading margins and best-in-class capital efficiencies. They expect revenues and margins to be driven by its new capacity, and a greater contribution from exports and B2B business. They also forecast earnings to fall 9% on the year (YoY) in FY26 (led by AC segment), with a 16% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for earnings between FY26 and FY28.JP Morgan has initiated its coverage on Tata Capital with a target price of Rs 370. Analysts said they see the company as one that is uniquely positioned to deliver system-leading growth and gain market share, backed by its strong liability profile, comprehensive product mix and an extensive omnichannel distribution network. Its ‘risk before growth’ approach drives its industry-best GNPA and credit costs, providing confidence in its ability to weather asset quality downcycles without taking a major hit. They expect Tata Capital’s FY26 return on assets (RoA) to moderate to 1.9% and significantly lagging peers, they see scope for expansion from higher net interest margins (NIMs), lower credit costs and opex. They believe at the current price, the risk-reward profile is favourable.Emkay Global has initiated its coverage on Deepak Fertilizer with the target price at Rs 2,000. Analysts said that the company is a leader in mining and industrial chemicals, with a lion’s share in domestic markets. It is also the market leader in water-soluble fertilizers. Its product portfolio is well aligned with India’s growth story, and it has plans to move from commodity to specialty offerings across existing product portfolios. They also said that the company’s technical ammonium nitrate (TAN) expansion in Gopalpur, nitric acid (NA) expansion in Dahej, and the Equinor contract’s pricing benefit in ammonia manufacturing will drive at least 50% EBITDA growth over FY26 to FY28. The company has restructured its businesses into different entities, which it plans to demerge in the next 2-3 years. This, in turn, would lead to value unlocking and multiple re-rating across businesses.IDBI Capital has initiated its coverage of Adani Energy with the target price at Rs 1,195. Analysts said the company is wired for the future. It has a large market size opportunity in the transmission space. It’s also well-poised in the smart-metering business and is chasing growth via the energy solutions business. Analysts believe Adani Energy has a strong EBITDA visibility for the future.Goldman Sachs maintained its buy rating on PTC Industries with the target price at Rs 24,725. Analysts said that the company is adding capacity expansion at Mehsana to add competencies in the industrial casting segment. This facility may be an important enabler increasing industrial castings revenue. There’s an increasing trend in global OEMs to diversify and such a policy of de-risking the supply chains would benefit the Mehsana facility.","Morgan Stanley initiated its coverage on LG Electronics with an overweight rating and a target price of Rs 1,864.

MCX Gold has been exhibiting a steady upward momentum, and this positive trend has opened the possibility of prices moving toward the ₹1,27,000 level in the near term. The recent price action suggests strong buying interest, supported by favorable global cues and renewed investor confidence. However, this optimism must be balanced with caution, as the upcoming week is expected to be data-heavy. A series of key economic releases from the United States—delayed due to the recent government shutdown—could inject volatility into global markets, including commodities like gold.Given this backdrop, traders are advised to maintain disciplined risk management. A strict stop-loss at ₹1,22,000 is recommended to protect long positions. This level has been acting as a crucial support zone; a break below it could indicate a shift in sentiment.If prices fall below this stop-loss, gold may witness a deeper correction, potentially dragging it down toward the ₹1,18,000 mark, where the next major support lies.Overall, while the broader outlook remains constructive, traders should stay vigilant and responsive to global macro developments. With significant US economic data on the way, adopting a cautious yet strategic approach will be essential for navigating short-term market fluctuations.MCX Silver has shown strong upward momentum, successfully moving above the ₹1,58,000 mark and gradually approaching its previous swing high near ₹1,65,800. This breakout reflects renewed strength in the bullion market, supported by improving sentiment, global uncertainty, and steady buying interest from investors seeking safety. The price action suggests that silver may continue its upward journey if bullish conditions persist, especially with supportive cues from international markets.However, despite the encouraging trend, traders should remain cautious. Much like gold, silver is also sensitive to global economic data, currency movements, and macro-level developments. With several important economic indicators expected from the US this week—following delays caused by the recent government shutdown—volatility may rise across precious metals.To manage this potential risk, it is advisable to maintain a strict stop-loss at ₹1,55,500. This level serves as a crucial support area and helps protect against sudden downside moves. If silver fails to sustain above this threshold, it could trigger profit-booking or aggressive selling pressure, which may drag prices down toward the ₹1,45,000 level, where the next major support exists.Overall, while the broader trend remains constructive, adopting disciplined risk management and monitoring global cues closely will be essential for navigating the short-term movements in MCX Silver.","Gold prices may move towards Rs 1,27,000 levels in the near term, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Zomato to share customer contact with restaurants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/zomato-to-share-customer-contact-with-restaurants/articleshow/125447592.cms,"MUMBAI: In a win for the restaurant industry, Zomato has agreed to share customers' phone numbers with eateries after seeking consent from users, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) said. The restaurant industry had been at loggerheads with food delivery platforms - Zomato and Swiggy - over their refusal to share consumer data, which the eateries claimed to be an unfair practice.The move, restaurateurs said, will allow them to know who their customers are and offer a better experience by fixing issues that cannot be addressed adequately through online aggregator platforms. For instance, restaurants can now step in if there's a problem with the order or if the eateries want to confirm some order details with consumers, Gauri Devidayal, partner at Food Matters told TOI. Currently, there's an option for consumers to call a restaurant, but the eateries cannot contact them directly. Zomato couldn't be immediately reached for a comment.Getting consumers' phone number will also allow restaurants to figure out if the consumer visits their offline stores besides giving them data about the area from which they are getting orders. To be sure, Zomato and Swiggy currently share select macro-level data with restaurants like the number of people ordering from a certain radius, the time taken by a restaurant to prepare orders but not consumer-specific details, said Devidayal.""As of now, we didn't know how often a customer is ordering on Zomato and Swiggy.

Muted consumer appetite is pulling down the valuation growth of India's top 75 brands, with growth in 2024-25 slipping to 6%, in contrast to the 19% jump recorded last year. The combined value of these brands rose to $475.4 billion, according to the Kantar BrandZ Most Valuable Brands Report 2025.The study measures contribution of brands to financial performance, analysing 1,620 brands across 112 categories, with rankings combining financial metrics with consumer perception surveys.Interestingly, even as mass consumption is sluggish, momentum is shifting toward the fast growing ""experience economy,"" with travel and hospitality brands emerging as some of the year's strongest performers. Brands including Taj, IndiGo and MakeMyTrip are among the year's biggest risers, buoyed by consumers prioritising experiences over everyday staples, the study says. Others like the fastest growing Zomato (expansion into lifestyle categories with its District by Zomato dine-out app) and entry of retail chain Westside echo the above trend.Significantly, the Kantar study notes that India's brand value growth is lagging its GDP expansion, underscoring a paradox where strong economic performance has not translated into brand value creation.The weak demand is compounded by a steady erosion of consumer equity: The share of Indian brands with consumer appeal, or perceived as 'meaningfully different', have plunged from nearly 12% in 2014 to 4.3% in 2025.""What is of concern is that a third of India's top 100 brands (around 31%) score low on consumer appeal versus only 11% globally. In today's landscape, understanding how consumers experience and interpret your brand is no longer optional, it's a strategic imperative. Sustained measurement and actionable insights enable brands to forge stronger customer connections, maintain relevance and secure long-term competitive advantage,"" Soumya Mohanty, managing director and chief solutions officer, South Asia, Kantar, told TOI.According to the report, HDFC Bank is India's most valuable brand, up 18% to nearly $45 billion. Other valuable brands include Tata Consultancy Services, Airtel, Infosys, and ICICI Bank. ·This year, four cement brands appear in the ranking for the first time, reflecting the sector's role in powering India's infrastructure boom.

X-factor for sensex next year: GST cut impact on economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/x-factor-for-sensex-next-year-gst-cut-impact-on-economy/articleshow/125447411.cms,"MUMBAI: What's in store for the Indian markets and the corporates in 2026? As the year 2025-marked by high volatility and single-digit returns for sensex and Nifty-nears its end, brokerages and analysts are queuing up to come out with their predictions and expectations for the coming year.Analysts and strategists from a host of foreign and Indian brokerages are bullish on India, with most listing the govt's policy support for the economy as one of the key catalysts, with external factors as a major risk for India. One of the top monitorables for the Indian economy in the coming year would be the impact of the recent GST rate cut on the economy.Recently, Morgan Stanley India's Ridham Desai said that Indian investors could expect a strong bounce in the domestic market with sensex rising about 13% from current levels by the end of Dec 2026. Desai sees a 13% upside in sensex through Dec 2026, translating to about 96,000 points for the index. And in a bull-case scenario, sensex could cross the 1-lakh-point mark next year.In a note, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Desai said they see Indian equities regaining their mojo in 2026 as the long-term story is gaining strength with govt policy action, and the cyclical recovery is backed by policy pivot. ""Most risks to our views come from outside India,"" the report said.Rajiv Batra of JP Morgan India is expecting accelerated double-digit growth in corporate earnings in the second half of the current fiscal, which would spill over to fiscal 2027. Batra's expectations are based on the better-than-expected numbers that India Inc announced during the July-Sept quarter. Analysts at JP Morgan India ""see a confluence of factors like benign inflation boosting household purchasing power, another strong monsoon, direct tax cuts in the Budget, GST cuts, and monetary and regulatory easing. ""For Citi India's Surendra Goyal, there are a few monitorable factors for the Indian economy and the markets in 2026. Festive season demand saw an uptick but remains to be seen if the momentum sustains, Goyal wrote in a strategy note for India. ""Update on the US-India trade deal and confidence on return to double digit earnings trajectory in FY27 remain key,"" Goyal said.According to Mahesh Nandurkar at Jefferies India, the sustainability of the GST-driven consumption uptick is key for a stronger earnings trajectory for the Indian market.For Seshadri Sen and his team at Emkay Global, the top of their expectations list is an earnings recovery in the current half of the fiscal, which could come on the back of consumption bounce-back. They expect Nifty to reach the 28,000-point mark by Sept 2026, translating to a gain of about 8% from Wednesday's close for the index.",The year 2025-marked by high volatility and single-digit returns for sensex and Nifty-nears its end.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as 'very poor' — despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog continued to blanket Delhi on Monday, showing little improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 385.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Iconic areas like India Gate and Kartavya Path were shrouded in toxic smog, with AQI readings of 341 (‘very poor’). Other hotspots included Chandni Chowk (383), RK Puram (366), ITO (394), Punjabi Bagh (384), Patparganj (369), Pusa (365), and Dwarka Sector-8 (356).Meanwhile, Anand Vihar remained engulfed in a layer of toxic smog, with the CPCB reporting an AQI of 383, classified as ‘very poor’.The thick smog, along with deteriorating air quality, mercury continued to hover around the 9 Degree Celsius mark, with some areas recording even lower temperatures.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.Following the deteriorating air quality in the national capital, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III was implemented on November 11 across Delhi by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The measures aim to control emissions through stricter restrictions on construction, vehicular movement and industrial operations.Under GRAP-III, restrictions include a ban on most non-essential construction, limits on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of in-person classes for students up to Class 5 with a shift to online or hybrid learning, curbs on industries using non-clean fuels, and a ban on non-emergency diesel generators.Earlier, the Supreme Court directed the governments of Punjab and Haryana to file a status report on the measures taken to curb stubble burning, which contributes to the air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region.A bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered, ""We direct the state of Punjab and Haryana to file a report on what steps are being taken to curb stubble burning.""Since Diwali, air quality in Delhi and the NCR has remained in the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories in several areas, despite Stage III of the GRAP being in effect.","The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am.

Trump’s tariff impact! US trade deficit falls 24% as imports plunged in August; government shutdown delayed data release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-impact-us-trade-deficit-falls-24-per-cent-as-imports-plunged-in-august-shutdown-delayed-data-release/articleshow/125445151.cms,"AI image

The US trade deficit narrowed by about 24 per cent in August as sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump reduced imports, according to a delayed Commerce Department report released Wednesday.According to Associated Press, citing the report, the trade gap fell to $59.6 billion in August from $78.2 billion in July. Imports declined 5 per cent to $340.4 billion as businesses slowed purchases from abroad after stockpiling goods ahead of tariffs that took effect on August 7. Exports rose 0.1 per cent to $280.8 billion.Trump has upended decades of US free-trade policy by levying broad duties on most trading partners as well as on products such as steel, copper and automobiles. He argues that chronic trade deficits reflect foreign nations exploiting the US. Economists say tariffs are contributing to inflation by raising costs that importers largely pass to consumers.Despite August’s pullback, the trade deficit has widened in 2025, reaching $713.6 billion through August — up 25 per cent from $571.1 billion in the same period last year.A narrower trade gap typically supports economic growth because imports subtract from gross domestic product.“August’s smaller trade deficit will be a tailwind for third-quarter real GDP, since it means more US spending went to domestically-produced goods and services,” said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. The release was delayed due to the government shutdown.Public anger over living costs contributed to Democratic gains in the November 4 elections. Days later, Trump rolled back tariffs on items such as beef, coffee, tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and some fertilisers, acknowledging their effect on prices.The Supreme Court is weighing the legality of the tariffs. During a November 5 hearing, justices questioned whether a president can impose open-ended duties under emergency powers without approval from Congress.",The trade gap fell to $59.6 billion in August from $78.2 billion in July.

Pakistan stocks soar: KSE-100 surges 40% — What’s driving the market after years of volatility?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistan-stocks-soar-kse-100-surges-40-whats-driving-the-market-after-years-of-volatility/articleshow/125443910.cms,"What resulted in the rare rally

Economic landscape:

Political situations:

Renewed interest:

Fin-fluencer effect:

Other investments:

Pakistan’s stock market is experiencing an unusual surge, driven largely by retail investors, signalling renewed confidence in local equities after years of uncertainty.The KSE-100 Index has soared roughly 40% in 2025, making Pakistan one of Asia’s top-performing markets. With property prices stagnant and deposit rates halved over the past two years, more individuals are turning to shares as an alternative investment, Bloomberg reported.“We’re now seeing a liquidity-led rally,” said Mohammed Sohail, chief executive officer at Topline Securities Ltd. “Unless that liquidity finds a new avenue, the markets will likely stay strong.”The market’s momentum coincides with Pakistan’s improving economic landscape. After narrowly avoiding a debt default in 2023, the country received upgrades from S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings this year, reflecting better fiscal management and progress under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s IMF-backed reforms.Current political and strategic developments have also fueled this sentiment. The country's field marshal Asim Munir, widely regarded as Pakistan’s most powerful leader, has been credited with strengthening US relations.His elevation to a role extending until 2030 is seen as reinforcing stability.Investor participation is rising sharply. Nearly 36,000 new trading accounts were opened in the September quarter, up from 23,600 in the previous three months, according to Topline Securities. Trading activity has followed suit, with daily turnover surpassing $200 million in October—the highest since 2017, Bloomberg data show.Financial influencers online also play a role in fueling the interest. One such example is Jawad Khalid Mirza, a 44-year-old chief information security officer who once dismissed the market as gambling that ignored fundamentals. However, after following local “fin-fluencers” on Facebook, he invested in National Foods Ltd., a producer of ketchup and spices he personally uses.Mutual fund investments are also on the rise. By September, 16% of total assets managed by asset management companies were invested in equities, up from 9% at the start of the year, according to the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan.Stock market experts, have said that the steadiness will most probably continue for some more time. Mattias Martinsson, chief investment officer at Stockholm-based Tundra Fonder AB, told Bloomberg that ongoing crises have made companies more prudent in financial management, while the central bank has become more transparent.Nevertheless, inflation poses risks, with Bloomberg Economics predicting a further rise in prices after an unexpected acceleration in October. Geopolitical tensions with India and Afghanistan could also weigh on investor sentiment.Foreign investors are pulling back, selling a net $308 million in local shares in 2025, their largest annual outflow since 2018.Martinsson remains cautiously positive saying that in order to be optimistic from here on, ""you need to expect that the next 10 years for Pakistan will be better than the last ten.""The expert further added that even more gains could emerge on the way ahead, ""but they could be slower and steadier than what we saw in the last few years.""","Pakistan's stock market is experiencing an unusual surge, driven largely by retail investors.

"Trump's $2,000 tariff rebate promise: Is it even feasible? When Americans might actually get it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-2000-tariff-rebate-promise-is-it-even-feasible-when-americans-might-actually-get-it/articleshow/125443026.cms,"Less inflow, more outflow?



Checks limited to tax filers and spouses with a $100,000 individual income cap could cost $279.8 billion – $121 billion above projected revenue.



Expanding payments to include non-filers, spouses, and dependents could push costs to $606.8 billion, nearly double the expected 2025–26 tariff revenue .

Congressional support....or maybe not?



Trump's promise may backfire



Legal obstacles



When, if at all, the rebate could arrive



US President Donald Trump has vowed a tariff rebate of $2,000 to Americans next year, offering a potential financial boost to millions facing high costs of living.“We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We’re going to be issuing dividends…probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income,” Trump announced earlier on Monday.Experts, however, beg to differ, as the promise still faces a long and thorny road ahead. Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN, “It’s highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked.”Even prediction markets reflect scepticism: users on Polymarket assign just an 11% probability that a tariff dividend will arrive by March 31.While tariffs are generating revenue, the cost of rebate checks could exceed incoming funds. Trump’s new tariffs are expected to raise $158.4 billion in 2025 and $207.5 billion in 2026, according to the Tax Foundation.The foundation also modelled dividend scenarios:But the problem with these predictions is that the overall value in all these situations would still exceed the incoming money.Approval from Congress is another major barrier.Republican lawmakers concerned about deficits may resist allocating $300–600 billion in additional spending.The national debt, having surpassed $34 trillion in January 2024, now sits at $38 trillion, CNN reported.While the rebate could relieve financial strain for households, some economists warn it could worsen inflation. Additional consumer spending without a corresponding increase in supply can push prices higher.Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and former Trump economic adviser, said, “Sending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy. If there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Stimulus checks only stimulate inflation.”Using tariff revenue for dividend payments could also unsettle bond markets, raising Treasury yields and making loans and mortgages more expensive. Ed Mills, a Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, noted, “What Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly.”Legal uncertainty adds another complication. During Supreme Court hearings this month, justices questioned the use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs. The Tax Foundation estimates that potentially invalid tariffs make up roughly 75% of the projected new revenue.“If the Supreme Court says the bulk of the tariffs are illegal, that could throw a wrench in the tariff rebate plan,” Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation told CNN.With all the above reasons, traders are not counting on the promise to materialise.For now, Wall Street investors remain cautious. Bob Elliott, CEO of alternative investment firm Unlimited, said, “We’ve learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality.”One scenario in which the checks could become reality is an economic emergency. Rising unemployment or a weakened job market could force the White House to argue that direct payments are necessary to prevent a recession.“It’s almost like we shouldn’t want stimulus checks to happen,” Mills said. “Because it would be an indicator of something wrong. This is a break-the-glass, use in case of emergency tool.”","US President Donald Trump has vowed a tariff rebate of $2,000 to Americans next year.

Baby Shark grows up rich!

The Baby shark effect

Growing pains and legal battles

More than Baby Shark?

can it avoid being seen as a one-hit wonder?

What the company plans next

Can a simple children’s song really grow into a company valued at more than $100 million? Well that’s exactly what happened with South Korea’s Pinkfong!But how did a tiny digital-content start-up with only three employees turn into a company worth hundreds of millions in under a decade?Well the story starts long back with a tiny Seoul office where three people worked without knowing whether they would even get paid. One of them, Kim Min-seok, now looks back at that early setup and laughs at how small the room was. “The office was tiny – even smaller than this,” he said, explaining to the BBC team that they “didn't even expect a salary at the time”.Now, more than a decade later, the same company has listed its shares on South Korea’s stock market.On Tuesday, its debut saw the stock climb over 9%, pushing Pinkfong’s value past $400m (£304m). It is a remarkable jump for a business that originally made digital content simply to entertain children up to the age of 12.The turning point came from something Kim approved without much thought: a 90-second video uploaded in June 2016. That video was Baby Shark, the children’s song now watched more than 16 billion times on YouTube, giving it the title of the platform’s most viewed video ever.“We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,” he told the BBC from Pinkfong’s headquarters.“But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.”While the viral version belongs to Pinkfong, the tune itself is believed to date back to US summer camps in the 1970s. Media analyst Kevin Chew describes the modern recording’s repetitive line, “Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,” as something “attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults”.Kim agrees the tune has a strange power. “It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,” he said. He believes the melody’s “chanting” feel makes it easy for young children to remember.The Baby Shark clip did not go viral immediately. Its rise began only after the dance routine was picked up at kids’ events in South East Asia. Once videos of children and adults dancing started circulating online, views climbed rapidly. Kim remembers the mood in the office changing overnight: “festival-like,” he said, as they watched the numbers jump in real time.By November 2020, it became the most viewed video on YouTube, and for several years it brought in around half of Pinkfong’s total revenue. The company soon expanded its characters, merchandise and content catalogue.Success also came with challenges. In 2019, an American composer accused Pinkfong of plagiarism. The company argued its version was based on a public-domain folk song. South Korea’s Supreme Court eventually rejected the claim, a decision Kim described as uplifting, though Pinkfong had filed its stock listing application before the verdict.Now, Pinkfong has grown far beyond its early three-person team. It now has around 340 employees and offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles. The firm rebranded itself in 2022 as The Pinkfong Company, taking the name from the cheerful pink fox character that first appeared in its early content.Yet the company now faces a question many investors are asking:Korea University’s Min Jung Kim says its main advantage is its target audience, toddlers, who tend to watch the same content repeatedly. Still, she believes the company must prove that other characters can match Baby Shark’s reach.Baby Shark currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong’s revenue, while another franchise, Bebefinn, now makes up roughly 40%.Parents’ reactions vary too. Saleem Nashef, a father of two told the BBC that he appreciates the learning elements in Pinkfong videos, though his wife thinks Baby Shark is “too over-stimulating for kids”. Their daughter, nearly three, remains a fan regardless, her upcoming birthday will be Baby Shark-themed.Pinkfong raised almost $52m from its stock market debut. Kim said the company will use the funds to expand its characters and films, with a goal of becoming a “tech-driven” creator using viewing data to shape its projects.For now, Kim insists the company’s future will not be limited by its biggest hit. Pinkfong, he said, has already achieved “what many creators have always dreamed of”. The next chapter is proving that lightning can strike again.","South Korea's Pinkfong is valued at more than $100m (£304m) The company started out with just three employees in a tiny Seoul office.

Japan-China feud deepens? Beijing planning to cease Tokyo's seafood imports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-china-feud-deepens-beijing-planning-to-cease-tokyos-seafood-imports-heres-why/articleshow/125436063.cms,"‘OUR TERRITORY!’: China-Japan Spat Grows After Xi’s Coast Guard Sails Near Disputed Senkaku Islands

The latest dispute between Japan and China has now entered the trade sphere, with Tokyo media reporting that Beijing is planning to halt Japanese seafood imports.However the reports, which emerged on Wednesday and were widely carried by outlets, still remain unconfirmed by governments of both the countries as the diplomatic row deepens.Reports from Tokyo suggest that the seafood suspension is being linked by China to its monitoring of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. NHK, which carried the news, said that China called the step as part of its assessment of the release, which began in 2023 and had already prompted an earlier blanket ban on Japanese marine goods. Beijing had only recently restarted purchases of some products before the latest development surfaced.The UN atomic agency has backed Japan’s wastewater discharge, the equivalent of 540 Olympic swimming pools of cooling water accumulated since the 2011 tsunami, as safe. China, however, has continued to criticise the operation, accusing Tokyo of treating the Pacific like a “sewer”.When asked on Wednesday, China’s foreign ministry declined to confirm any new halt to imports. Spokeswoman Mao Ning said, “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese seafood were exported to China, there would not be a market.”Japan’s chief cabinet secretary Minaru Kihara also said there had been “no notifications from the Chinese side on this”, stressing the “importance” of honouring the understanding reached by both governments in September last year on seafood issues.Japanese shipments of seafood to mainland China were worth 15.6% of a total 390 billion yen in 2023, down from 22.5% in 2022. That same year, Hong Kong accounted for 26.1% of the total and the United States 15.7%.Relations between the two Asian giants have sharply deteriorated since November 7, when new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that Japan could intervene militarily if Taiwan came under attack.The remarks prompted an immediate backlash from China, which maintains that Taiwan is part of its territory. Beijing summoned Japan’s ambassador and even warned Chinese nationals against travelling to Japan. It also delayed the release of at least two Japanese films, according to state media.The diplomatic clash is also spilling into travel. China remains Japan’s biggest source of tourists, drawing almost 7.5 million visitors in the first nine months of 2025. But travel agencies say demand has fallen sharply. One analyst estimated that Chinese travellers have cancelled roughly half a million air tickets in recent days.“Recently, 90 percent of our customers (going to Japan) have asked for refunds,” said Shanghai travel agency manager Wu Weiguo, 48. His colleague, 47-year-old Zhou Pei, told AFP “I think relations will be able to improve, as long as Japan can tone down their rhetoric... After all, there are a lot of Chinese people currently in Japan, including my cousin, who is married to someone there.”Tokyo has advised Japanese nationals in China to stay alert and avoid crowded locations. Beijing responded on Tuesday by promising to “protect the safety” of foreigners, while also confirming it had issued a renewed “strong protest” over Takaichi’s comments.Seeking to reduce tensions, senior Japanese diplomat Masaaki Kanai held discussions in Beijing on Tuesday with Chinese foreign ministry official Liu Jinsong. After the meeting, ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said China had “once again lodged a strong protest with Japan” regarding “Takaichi’s erroneous remarks”.“Takaichi’s fallacies seriously violate international law and the basic norms governing international relations,” she said, arguing that the prime minister’s comment “fundamentally damage the political foundation of China-Japan relations.”","Beijing is planning to halt Japanese seafood imports, according to reports from Tokyo. The reports, which emerged on Wednesday, still remain unconfirmed by governments of both the countries. Reports suggest that the seafood suspension is being linked by China to its monitoring of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125436174,imgsize-137144,width-400,resizemode-4/this-is-an-ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representative-purpose.jpg"
Is gold renting the new trend? Investors earn yields by ‘renting’ idle gold to jewellers; here’s how,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-gold-renting-the-new-trend-investors-earn-yields-by-renting-idle-gold-to-jewellers-heres-how/articleshow/125433793.cms,".

Why investors are leasing gold

How gold leasing works

Risks of gold leasing

Gold prices have been breaking records this year, and wealthy investors and family offices are now looking for ways to earn returns on their bullion. Instead of keeping gold bars locked in vaults, more of them are leasing their metal to refiners, jewelers, and fabricators to earn interest — a major shift for an asset long viewed as non-yielding.“We’ve got a whole bunch of phone calls with people saying, I have $2 million of gold bars, I have a million dollars-worth of gold bars. Can you lease it out for me?” Gaurav Mathur, founder of SafeGold told CNBC.“What’s changed very substantially in the last few months is that a lot of the wealthier customers have now got comfortable with leasing,” he reportedly said. SafeGold’s leasing volumes have jumped from $2 million to $40 million since the start of the year.Industry experts say the idea is straightforward: investors who already want to hold gold can earn yields, while jewelers and fabricators get the metal they need for daily production. Borrowers return the same amount of gold rather than a dollar amount, protecting them from price swings.SafeGold currently offers a 2% yield on secured leases and 4% on unsecured ones, with rates earlier this year reaching as high as 3% and 5%.“People are no longer just buying gold and waiting for it to go up to $5,000,” said Keith Weiner, founder and CEO of Monetary Metals to CNBC.Gold leasing works like a loan, but the asset is measured in ounces, not dollars. Investors supply gold to a platform or financier, which then lends the metal to a business that needs it.For jewelers and refiners, this avoids taking out a cash loan and worrying about gold price changes while holding inventory. They pay a lease rate in gold and return the same amount of metal at the end of the term or extend the lease.If gold prices rise, both their selling price and the cost of buying back the gold move together, helping them keep stable margins.Gold prices have risen more than 50% this year and are on track for their strongest annual gain since 1979, according to LSEG. The surge has inflated the value of every bar, increasing financing needs along the supply chain.Demand from jewelers has doubled in the past four months, said Patrick Tuohy, CEO of Goldstrom. He added that while central banks and bullion banks have long dominated gold leasing, wealthy individual investors are now entering the space through new platforms.Gold leasing comes with risks that simple vault storage does not. “Lending gold – whether on a lease or a swap – carries a counterparty risk. In other words, the risk that the borrower may not pay you back,” said John Reade of the World Gold Council. According to CNBC, he warned that attractive yields still require caution and careful checks on borrowers.The biggest risk is default. A borrower may fail to return the gold on time or return bars with lower purity. Mathur said SafeGold tests every bar that comes back. Weiner said Monetary Metals uses insurance, audits, cameras, and radio frequency identification technology, but noted that “you could never say zero” when it comes to eliminating risk.Tuohy said Goldstrom uses RFID-tagged jewelry made from leased gold, with each piece sending live data to the company. “We literally turn the jeweler’s shop into a vault,” he said. Cameras and sensors track inventory, and insurers cover theft or employee fraud. If a jeweler defaults, Goldstrom can seize and melt the jewelry to recover the metal. “This model has been running in the Middle East since 2006 — and there’s never been a default,” he said.","Gold leasing works like a loan, but the asset is measured in ounces, not dollars.

"Fully functional, opulent: Solid gold toilet fetches $12.1m at NYC auction; artwork was titled ‘America’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fully-functional-opulent-solid-gold-toilet-fetches-12-1m-at-nyc-auction-artwork-was-titled-america/articleshow/125425451.cms,"(Image source: X/@Sothebys)

A solid gold toilet — the satirical Maurizio Cattelan artwork once offered to US President Donald Trump — became the talk of the art world again on Tuesday when it sold for $12.1 million at Sotheby’s New York.The 18-karat, fully functional sculpture, titled America, weighs more than 220 pounds and opened bidding at $10 million. The auction took place during what Sotheby’s described as a “soft patch” for top-tier art sales, Forbes reported.Created by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, America has a history as striking as its materials. The work first drew widespread attention in 2016 when it was installed in a public bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, attracting nearly 100,000 visitors. The toilet also became a pop-culture curiosity when the Guggenheim, after the Trump White House requested a Van Gogh painting, offered the gold toilet instead, an overtly satirical counteroffer that went unanswered.Sotheby’s describes the piece as an “incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value.” Cattelan himself has said the work mocks extreme wealth, noting: “Whether you eat a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,” CNN reported.Another edition of the gold toilet was stolen in 2019 in a dramatic heist at Blenheim Palace, Winston Churchill’s birthplace. Thieves used sledgehammers to detach it from its plumbing. Although two men were eventually convicted, the sculpture was never recovered and is believed to have been melted down.Cattelan has previously said he created more than one edition of the piece.Tuesday’s auction also included major works from the late cosmetics billionaire Leonard Lauder’s collection. Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sold for $236.3 million, while Blumenwiese and Waldabhang bei Unterach am Attersee fetched $86 million and $70.6 million respectively, according to Forbes.A day earlier, a Mark Rothko abstract from the collection of the late Weis Market chairman Robert F Weis and his wife Patricia sold for $62.1 million, bringing the total for that collection to $218 million.","The 18-karat, fully functional sculpture, titled America, weighs more than 220 pounds and opened bidding at $10 million.

Early trading saw the S&P 500 fall 0.3%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 361 points and the Nasdaq composite declining 0.6%, AP reported.The weakness followed another volatile stretch for the US market. Home Depot was among the biggest drags after reporting summer-quarter profit below expectations, with the retailer attributing the shortfall to fewer major storms, anxious consumers and a continuing slowdown in the housing market. The company’s shares fell 3.1% and it cut its fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings guidance while raising its sales growth outlook.The rout in artificial-intelligence-related stocks continued to shape market direction. Nvidia, whose shares have fallen 8.6% this month, slipped another 1.1% ahead of its earnings announcement due on Wednesday after a 1.9% decline on Monday. Other chipmakers—including Micron, Intel and Qualcomm—lost between 1% and 2%.Among the tech giants, Microsoft slid 1.5% while Amazon dropped 1.8%.Cloudflare shares also weakened after a technical issue at the internet infrastructure provider triggered global outages affecting services such as ChatGPT. European and Asian markets followed Wall Street lower, with major indices in Germany, France and the UK down 1.4% by midday.Futures trading mirrored the cautious mood, with S&P 500 and Dow futures down 0.6% and 0.7% respectively, and Nasdaq futures retreating 0.7%.Investors are also bracing for the delayed US employment data, scheduled for release on Thursday after the prolonged government shutdown. The update is expected to influence the US Federal Reserve’s next interest rate move. While markets had anticipated continued rate cuts to support a weakening labour market, officials have pointed to the risk of worsening inflation, which remains above the 2% target.A strong jobs report could delay further rate cuts, while particularly weak numbers may raise concerns about economic momentum. Fed policymakers have also cited limited data availability due to the shutdown as a reason for adopting a more cautious stance.Across Asia, markets retreated sharply. Japan’s 30-year government bond yield surged to 3.31% as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepared higher government spending plans and delayed efforts to reduce public debt. The yen hovered above 155 per dollar. The Nikkei 225 slumped 3.2%, dragged down by major chip-related names including Tokyo Electron, which fell 5.5%, and Advantest, down 3.7%.In Seoul, the Kospi tumbled 3.3%, with Samsung Electronics losing 2.8% and SK Hynix sinking 5.9%.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

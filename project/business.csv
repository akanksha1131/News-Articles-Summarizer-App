Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday as the December 2025 futures contract climbed to Rs 1,70,415 per kilogram. This marks an increase of Rs 1,977 or 1.18% for the day.The surge in silver prices has resulted in a remarkable 19.8% gain for the month of October, rising from a closing price of Rs 1,42,145 on September 30. This significant monthly increase highlights strong festive demand and growing industrial interest in the metal.The recent rally has sparked renewed interest in silver's long-term potential, with analysts attributing the uptrend to solid underlying fundamentals. Mahendra Patil, Founder and Managing Partner at MP Financial Advisory Services LLP (MPFASL), noted that silver is experiencing ""a phase of structural endurance rather than speculative exuberance"", as quoted by Economic Times.Patil pointed out that while silver has historically been volatile, its past performance offers valuable insights. The metal previously approached the $50 per ounce mark in 1980 and 2011, and with 2025 marking its third such approach, the focus is now on whether it can maintain sustained momentum.In 2025, silver prices surged from $29 to over $47 per ounce, reaching ""its highest level in more than a decade."" MPFASL attributes this momentum to several factors, including ""higher expectations from US rate cuts, sustained central-bank buying, and industrial restocking across solar and electronics supply chains.""Highlighting silver's dual appeal, Patil said, ""Silver is gaining ground as both a symbolic and practical substitute. Beyond its decorative appeal, the industrial demand linked to solar panels, electronics, and electric mobility provides fundamental support to prices, creating a dual-use demand base that gold lacks.""The rise in silver demand is not limited to global markets. In India, silver imports have increased significantly. ""Silver imports have expanded, reflecting its growing relevance as an industrial and investment metal within the renewable-energy and electronics value chains,"" MPFASL reported.Data from the firm also revealed that silver delivered an annualized return of 32.92% in the CY2023–CY2025 period, with a volatility of 24.66%, based on historical performance. The correlation between gold and silver during this period stood at 0.95, indicating closely linked price movements, although silver's trajectory has increasingly been driven by industrial factors.Looking ahead, MPFASL suggests that silver may continue to benefit from its industrial underpinnings. ""Silver exceeded expectations, crossing $47 per ounce on renewed industrial restocking in solar and electronics,"" the report noted.Most projections indicate that silver is expected to remain in the $44–50 per ounce range through FY2026. While gold may experience consolidation, ""silver amplified the momentum as the cyclical bellwether of a broader industrial revival.""As India enters the festive season and global industrial restocking continues, the metal's trajectory will likely depend on sustained demand from the electronics and renewable sectors. MPFASL adds that silver's ability to surpass the $50 per ounce mark may depend on whether it can ""finally build sustained momentum and move toward the next big landmark, its metaphorical 'century.'""For domestic traders, Rs 1,70,415 now serves as a key resistance level on MCX. With industrial and festive tailwinds in play, attention will remain on whether silver can build upon this rally or consolidate near its current highs.","Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their rally for the third consecutive week driven by strong global cues and encouraging business updates from several companies. Positive start to the Q2FY26 earning sessions also supported by positive momentum. Dovish remarks from the Fed Chair on interest rates and indications of a possible pause in quantitative tightening, which buoyed global risk sentiment. Lower CPI and WPI data in India also boosted rate cut expectations in India.Nifty traded in a range in the first two trading sessions of the week. However, it gained momentum as the week progressed and rallied to three months high on Thursday. Index in the process generated a breakout above a falling supply line joining the major highs of September 2024 and June 2025 signaling strength and continuation of the up move.On the smaller time frame Nifty has generated a breakout above the last three months symmetrical triangular consolidation pattern highlighting positive bias and any dips should be used as a buying opportunity.We expect the index to head towards 25,900 and then towards 26,200 levels in the coming weeks being the 123.6% and 138.2% external retracement of the last three months' corrective decline (25669-24338).On the downside immediate support is placed at 25350-25400 levels being the recent breakout area while key support is placed at 25100-25,000 levels being the current week low and 20- & 50-days EMA.Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows. The index has also witnessed a breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern — a strong bullish reversal setup — reinforcing the positive trend.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty in the current leg of up move, with key private banking heavy weights Q2FY26 results lined up on coming Saturday. It will decide the next directional trigger for the index.With prices holding above key moving averages, the near-term bias remains upward. The index is likely to test our target of 58,000, being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous up move (53561-55835) as projected from the recent trough of 54226. Thursday's gap area of 56,700 will act as immediate support for the index.The RSI (14) at 66 indicates healthy momentum, suggesting strength in the uptrend. Any dips should be viewed as buying opportunities within this constructive setup.Reliance Industries' stock has undergone a corrective phase over the past three months and is currently consolidating near a crucial support zone. This technical setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, positioning the stock for a potential bullish reversal and the next leg of the uptrend.A key technical takeaway from the weekly chart of Reliance Industries is the time-price relationship, where the stock has taken 13 weeks to retrace merely 50% of the preceding 13-week rally from ₹1115 to ₹1551. This shallow and time-consuming retracement reflects inherent strength and a bullish undertone. The recent corrective phase is interpreted as a higher base formation, setting the stage for the next impulsive leg on the upside.The ongoing corrective phase appears to be nearing exhaustion, with price action indicating the potential for a fresh bullish reversal. We anticipate the stock to resume its primary uptrend and retest the previous swing highs around ₹1540 in the upcoming quarters, which correspond to the key resistance zones marked by the September 2024 and July 2025 peaks.Suzlon stands to be a prime beneficiary of India’s renewable energy expansion, with wind capacity projected to rise from 49.8 GW in 2024 to 127.9 GW by 2033. The company’s leadership in domestic manufacturing and a record firm orderbook of 5.7 GW as of Q1 FY26 provide multi-year revenue visibility and execution certainty. Recent marquee orders from Tata Power Renewable and Sunsure Energy reaffirm Suzlon’s strong demand pipeline, while the steady contribution from its high-margin O&M business adds stability and predictable cash flows to its earnings profile.Further strengthening its strategic position, Suzlon’s acquisition of a 76% stake in Renom Energy Services unlocks access to the large non-Suzlon O&M market, enhancing scale and profitability through cross-selling and synergies. The company’s calibrated capex of ₹400–450 crore, with a strong R&D focus, is set to drive innovation and operating leverage through efficient, export-ready turbine designs. Overall, Suzlon’s integrated model, improving margin mix, and balance of growth and annuity revenues underpin a constructive long-term investment outlook.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 17, 2025 are Reliance Industries, and Suzlon Energy.

The dilemma on festival dates

Muhurat Trading: A blend of tradition and finance



Remaining stock market holidays for the year





As Diwali approaches, many are uncertain whether the festival falls on October 20 or 21 this year. As for stock markets, investors would also like to know definitive dates of the days when trading will not happen. They have a definitive date to note: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.However, on October 21, a special trading activity will occur which is the traditional Muhurat Trading session, a symbolic ritual lasting one hour, from 1:45 PM to 2:45 PM. This session will allow trading across various segments, including equities, futures and options, currency and commodity derivatives, and securities lending and borrowing (SLB), with modifications permitted until 2:55 PM.The confusion arises because the lunar calendar's Amavasya tithi, or new moon phase, technically extends into October 21. However, the auspicious time for Lakshmi Puja is on the evening of October 20, leading most households to celebrate then. The following day marks the start of the new Hindu Samvat year, celebrated with the Muhurat Trading session on Dalal Street.This year, the Muhurat session will occur in the afternoon on October 21, a departure from recent years when it was held in the evening.Additionally, markets are closed on October 18 for Dhanteras and October 19 for the regular weekend schedule.Muhurat Trading, meaning ""auspicious hour,"" is more than just a market event. It symbolizes the beginning of Samvat 2082, the new Hindu financial year. For investors, it represents optimism and a prayer for prosperity rather than a focus on profits.This tradition has persisted for decades, often bringing positive returns. The Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the past 18 Muhurat sessions. Even during the 2008 global financial crisis, the index rose by 5.86% during the session. In 2024, it gained 335 points, or 0.42%, continuing the trend of festive cheer.Analysts, as quoted by ET, point out that trading volumes are typically low during this one-hour window, leading to potential volatility. However, the session is not seen as a typical trading day but rather a symbolic reset, where traders, families, and brokers come together to mark a hopeful start to the new year.After October 22, only two more holidays remain for stock markets part from the regular Saturdays and Sundays. Markets will be shut on November 5 for Prakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev and December 25 for Christmas"," Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.

Price action in the leading stocks indicate short covering. Even now there are big shorts in the system and the strength in the market might keep the bears on the back foot, facilitating further short covering. Good results from the banking majors HDFC and ICICI can impart fundamental support to the market, and if RIL, which has been a laggard for some time now, also joins the rally, the market can sustain the momentum for some more time.Muhurat trading and the festival cheer can add to the bullish spirits.""""However, there are some lingering concerns which should not be lost sight of. China has been imposing restrictions on exports of rare earth metals and magnets in recent days. China’s weaponisation of rare earths, in which it has around 90% global market share, is in response to Trump’s weaponisation of tariffs.

US equity futures suggested continued weakness.Gold surged to unprecedented levels on Friday, surpassing $4,300, setting up for its strongest weekly gains in 17 years.

PNB net profit jumps

14% to ₹4904 crore





Mumbai: India's private banks showed contrasting trends in asset quality in Q2 FY26, with larger lenders maintaining stability while smaller players, particularly those under new leadership, reported setbacks in earnings. IndusInd Bank and Federal Bank, both navigating transitions under new MDs, did not post year-on-year growth in net profits as the chiefs accelerated clean-ups and strengthened governance.HDFC Bank, the country's largest private lender, reported a 10.8% rise in net profit to Rs 18,640 crore, driven by a 25% jump in non-interest income and steady improvement in asset quality. MD and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan said economic activity was improving across customer and product segments, allowing the bank to accelerate loan growth. Asset quality remained a key strength, with the bank maintaining stable ratios for net interest margin, cost-to-income, and return on assets. HDFC Bank also continued its investments in technology and innovation, including GenAI and ""lighthouse experiments"", aimed at improving efficiency and customer experience over the next 18-24 months.ICICI Bank's net profit grew 5.2% to Rs 12,359 crore despite a steep drop in treasury income.Excluding treasury, core operating profit rose 6.5%, reflecting steady underlying performance. Provisions fell 25.9%, helping gross NPAs ease to 1.58% and net NPAs to 0.39%. The lender expanded retail and business banking loans, which now account for more than half its portfolio.IndusInd Bank, under new MD and CEO Rajiv Anand, recorded a net loss of Rs 437 crore as the bank accelerated write-offs and increased provisions in microfinance to strengthen its balance sheet. The lender also continued to contend with legacy issues stemming from prior accounting irregularities. Gross NPAs improved slightly to 3.60%, while net NPAs eased to 1.04% but deposits and advances contracted, and core income fell.YES Bank reported an 18.3% rise in net profit to Rs 654 crore, supported by higher non-interest income, cost efficiency, and retail growth. Net NPAs declined to 0.3% while gross NPAs remained stable at 1.6%. The quarter marked a strategic ownership change, with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation acquiring a 24.2% stake, and the bank continued to expand its branch network and digital footprint. MD and CEO Prashant Kumar emphasised the business model and strategy remained unchanged, with efforts ongoing to improve revenues, net interest margin, and cost-to-income ratio.Federal Bank posted a 9.5% decline in net profit to Rs 955 crore due to higher provisions, even as gross NPAs fell to 1.83% and net NPAs to 0.48%. Under new MD and CEO KVS Manian, the bank focused on strengthening risk management, increasing mid-yield assets, and expanding digital transactions, which now account for over 92% of all retail and corporate activity.Punjab National Bank reported a 14% rise in Q2 net profit to Rs 4,904 crore, with operating profit up 5.5% to Rs 7,227 crore. Total income grew 5.1%, while net interest income slipped 0.5%. Gross and net NPAs fell to 3.45% and 0.36%, respectively. Advances and deposits rose 10.1% and 10.9%. Retail, agriculture, and MSME loans drove growth. CRAR strengthened to 17.19%, digital transactions surged 31%, and full-year credit growth is expected at 11%-12%.","HDFC Bank, the country's largest private lender, reported a 10.8% rise in net profit.

Government will not rush to bail out exporters hit by US’s 50% tariff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-will-not-rush-to-bail-out-exporters-hit-by-uss-50-tariff/articleshow/124680019.cms,".





New Delhi: Govt is unlikely to rush ahead with a package to aid exporters hit by Trump’s 50% tariff as it is yet to get a full assessment of the situation. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters she is seeking feedback from textiles and marine exporters, seen to be worst affected even as the impact on others such as gems and jewellery sector is lower given the low level of value addition in India.Govt officials said rushing ahead will be counter-productive for exporters as they will be more than eager to offer discounts to US buyers, who would bargain harder once the tariffs are out of the way. Indian negotiators led by commerce secretary Rajesh Agarwal is in Washington for trade deal talks. Union minister Piyush Goyal said talks were progressing well, but India will not be bound by deadlines for the deal.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking feedback from textiles and marine exporters.

Eat first, lie later. Show fake payment screenshots, file false complaints. Some entitled customers are gaming the system and making gig workers pay the price

COD: CHEATED ON DELIVERY

FAKING UPI PAYMENTS

SPA BEDS AND STAR RATINGS

WORKERS PUSH BACK

Names of delivery workers have been changed to protect identities





Long shifts, meagre pay, arbitrary rules — even having to buy their own kits and raincoats during the monsoon — gig work platforms are often called out for their failures. But there’s another layer of exploitation that’s seldom talked about. Through impatience, privilege, and sometimes plain deceit, some customers are quietly chipping away at gig workers’ earnings and self-esteem.Six months ago, Mehtab Irfan, a 41-year-old delivery executive with a food delivery app, was delivering Chinese food to a Delhi-based customer. The customer had opted for cash on delivery and ‘paid’ via QR code. But as Irfan made his way downstairs, he got a ‘payment failed’ notification. Confused, he called the customer, who insisted he had already paid and flatly refused to check further. Irfan reported the problem to his company’s support team, which cancelled the order and gave the customer a full refund.But that wasn’t the end of it. Sometimes, when an order is cancelled, the restaurant expects the delivery partner to return the food and enter an OTP to close the loop.These are treated as ‘rescue orders’, later resold at a discount to avoid wastage. “In this case, there was nothing to return. The customer had already taken the meal. I found myself trapped in a bizarre limbo. Customer support accused me of fraud because I didn’t have any food to return. When the customer takes the food and the payment fails, the burden of blame falls on me,” says Irfan, who supports a family of five on earnings of Rs 700-1,000 a day.Across India’s gig economy, countless others face similar or worse battles, stemming from customer fraud or misbehaviour. Often, our sharp tones, hasty complaints and demand for instant gratification don’t just diminish workers’ dignity, but mean actual financial losses, and even deactivation from the platform.While Irfan was let off with a warning, Manoj Baghel, a delivery executive in Noida, faced a penalty after a customer complained about a ‘failed’ pizza delivery. “I delivered a pizza to Sector 52 at 10.30pm. Many hours later, at 7.30am, the customer claimed they hadn’t received it. Without a call from the company, Rs 1,200 was deducted from my payout. I don’t think a pizza costs that much. They probably included GST and taxes too,” says Baghel.“When I called the customer, he said it was because I was 15 minutes late. I asked why he didn’t just mention the delay instead of saying that the pizza didn’t come. But the customer said he wanted a refund. I messaged customer support: ‘If a customer eats and then says he never got the order, will you believe him?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ They never ask our side and just cut our money. Traffic, rush hours, jams, office crowds, none of that matters,” says Baghel, who has been interviewing for jobs in other sectors but hasn't had much luck so far. “Drunk customers hurl insults and threats over the smallest delays. They say things like ‘tum doh kauri ka kaam kar rahe ho’ (Your work is worth only two paise). Sometimes, I just want to drop everything and go home.”The 2024 ‘Prisoners on Wheel’ report by the People’s Association in Grassroots Action and Movements (PAIGAM) and Indian Federation of App-based Transport Workers (IFAT) surveyed 10,000 gig workers across eight major Indian cities. Beyond false claims of non-delivery and cash on delivery scams, which lead to direct financial losses, misuse of rating systems, verbal and physical abuse are rife, especially as retaliatory tactics.Anjana Karumathil, associate professor at IIM Kozhikode and a researcher on India’s gig economy, says customer scams are common. “Fake payment proofs are shown by customers flashing screenshots of ‘payment successful’, but the money never arrives,” says Karumathil, who has interviewed close to 200 gig workers nationwide. “Often, fraudsters use burner SIM cards to place orders at crowded locations, take goods, and disappear, making it impossible for workers to identify them,” she says.India leads globally in the number of blue-collar gig workers, but the model makes accountability challenging, says Karumathil. “Gig workers don’t fall under the category of employees or contractors, which means they’re not protected under Indian labour laws. They’re classified as ‘independent contractors’, which essentially leaves them on their own. They are using the app to find work, and for that they will get paid. But everything else is their problem. If they die, get injured, are attacked or defrauded by a customer — that’s on them,” Karumathil says.Gig platforms say they heed workers’ complaints. BlinkIt, which employs over 2.4 lakh active delivery partners, states that it has “robust systems” to verify claims by both customers and delivery partners, covering issues like non-payment, fake orders or fraud. It adds that delivery partners are not penalised for missing targets or delays. Any complaint against them is reviewed with a ‘root cause analysis’ before strict action is taken, and workers have avenues to appeal decisions. “We also take serious action against customers engaging in fraudulent or abusive behaviour, including warnings, temporary restrictions, or permanent bans,” a company spokesperson said.One of the problems, says Hyderabad-based Ali Aslam, who does deliveries for multiple platforms, is that a lot depends on star ratings and customer moods. “Your star ratings from customers decide everything. One call, you’ll be green. But if you call twice — maybe the customer said, ‘Hello, hello’ and the call got cut because of network issues — your ratings dip. Low ratings mean fewer deliveries,” he says.Customers and delivery partners have even come to blows. Irfan recalls a recent incident. “A rider, who did not know which floor he was supposed to deliver the groceries to, was beaten up by the customer and accused of tampering with a water motor. When he complained, the support team said, ‘Why did you even go up if the floor wasn’t listed?’ But please try asking customers to come down and fetch their orders and see what happens. You will have another complaint in your name!” he retorts.For women working with beauty and wellness apps, carrying foldable spa beds weighing 20-30 kg up the stairs in buildings without lifts can be a real problem. “Sometimes, the women of the house will come down to help and say they don’t mind doing it,” says Pallavi Mishra, who has been working for an app for three years. “But later, they complain on the app that we were slow or inefficient and give us bad ratings.” Now, whenever possible, she calls her husband to carry the spa bed upstairs. “I don’t need help coming down. It’s the climb up that breaks you.”Author and researcher Vandana Vasudevan ’s book ‘OTP Please! Online Buyers, Sellers and Gig Workers in South Asia,’ highlights the plight of gig workers across the subcontinent. Following the book’s release, Vasudevan recalls how one reader shared a troubling incident involving a home-services platform. “I remember this reader posting about cases in which a woman from the household makes the booking for a massage, but when the female worker reaches the address, she finds that the appointment is actually meant for the man. ” Delivering to gated societies brings its own challenges. “Riders have to wait outside for approval. Then when they get in, they have to use service lifts that are overcrowded and slow. Some societies are huge, so finding the right tower itself takes time and fuel. All of this eats into their earnings,” she says. Platforms, Vasudevan says, take a unilateral ‘customer is king’ view. “Customers are privileged because they bring business, while workers are seen as dispensable. Customers also have power on social media. They can tweet complaints, and platforms respond. But if workers post on X, they’re ignored as they have only two or three followers and often write in broken English,” she adds.But India’s gig worker unions are fighting back. “Workers are forced to shoulder the burden of customer misbehaviour without any meaningful support from companies. We have consistently demanded that companies and govts set up clear redressal mechanisms, insurance protections and fair policies to safeguard workers,” says Shaik Salauddin, founder and president, Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) and national general secretary, IFAT.Some workers have wisened up to scams. For instance, cab drivers have taken to locking the doors till UPI payments go through. Others like Aman, who drives a taxi for a ride-sharing platform, have learnt to see through frauds. “Recently, a madam asked me to pick up her mother from Sector 17 and drop her at New Delhi railway station. She said she’d pay Rs 800 in advance, but then claimed she’d mistakenly sent me Rs 8,000,” Yadav recounts. “I got a ‘bank message’ too, but my balance showed nothing. I told her I would return the money but only once I actually received it. She threatened me but I refused to give in. I even lied to her that I had a lady constable with me. Eventually, she switched off her phone. I can be a bigger fraud,” laughs Aman.","Some customers are quietly chipping away at gig workers’ earnings and self- esteem. ‘Drunk customers hurl insults and threats over the smallest delays.

Mumbai: Never mind pistachio prices, which have gone nuts, or the price volatility in items such as cocoa and coconut pushing up costs, Indians are looking beyond traditional mithai and spending on fusion sweets, artisanal desserts and chocolates this Diwali. White chocolate aam papad barfi, Chocolate with Cocoa Nibs, Pistache et boondi (a sweet dish) are among items that are in huge demand this year.“There has been a slight increase in price on products featuring pistachios, such as our Saffron Pistachio Fudge, Pistache et boondi, and our newly launched layered cake made with boondi, milk cake, and kataifi pistachio. This revision is directly aligned with the increased cost of sourcing pistachios.“With pistachio desserts going viral on social media, following the Dubai Viral Pistachio Kunafa chocolate, we are also seeing a lot more demand for these flavours,” said Dipti Sawalka, founder at Varak, a gourmet sweet brand based in Kolkata.Indians, many of whom have a sweet tooth, do not mind paying for fancy sweets during Diwali, a festival incomplete without mithai. Demand for assorted sweet boxes and hampers including a mix of sweets and savouries shoot up during the season.The GST cut on sweets and chocolates to 5% has helped a bit in compensating for higher input prices.Alpa Pereira, founder and head chef at Toujours said that its chocolate and pistachio dessert Taash has been a bestseller, along with Gourmet Trio Box and Festive Hamper. “The recent GST reduction from 18% to 5% has allowed us to offset the rise in input costs. We’ve been seeing a steady rise in the cost of almost all key raw materials from cocoa and pistachios to butter and dry fruits,” said Pereira.Premium gifting boxes are performing particularly well, said Sid Mathur, founder at Delhi’s Khoya Mithai. “Consumers are gravitating toward curated hampers that combine traditional mithai with a modern twist, such as rose-and-chocolate kaju katli, white chocolate aam papad barfi, and Medjoul date bars, along with savouries and Khoya Bars,” he said, adding that there’s also a growing preference for health-conscious options without compromising on flavour or presentation. For the company, the most popular gift hampers this season are priced between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000.Choko La’s edible firecrackers box (chocolates shaped as firecrackers) are completely sold out and the firm is increasing production projections every week. This is despite the brand raising prices of its (overall) products by 10-15% due to a steep increase in cost of cocoa earlier this year.There is a growing shift toward gifting experiences and artisanal desserts rather than just traditional sweets. “Our luxury chocolate boxes, White Chocolate With Roasted Pistachio, and Chocolate with Cocoa Nibs are doing exceptionally well this season. Consumers are moving toward smaller, elegant gift packs and customised assortments, a preference for premium, thoughtful gifting over volume-based purchase,” said Rahul Bajaj, director of Le Sutra Hospitality.","White chocolate aam papad barfi, Chocolate with Cocoa Nibs, Pistache et boondi (a sweet dish) are in huge demand this year.

Developers to act as urban infrastructure administrators in major city overhauls under UCF,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/developers-to-act-as-urban-infrastructure-administrators-in-major-city-overhauls-under-ucf/articleshow/124678673.cms,".





New Delhi: Learning from experiences of how realtors build high quality projects with facilities within their complexes while civic infrastructure outside usually getting neglected, the government will allow private developers to act as “urban infrastructure administrators” in major redevelopment zones under the ambitious Urban Challenge Fund (UCF) scheme.This means they will develop and maintain infrastructure, such as roads, water supply, sanitation and transportation. The scheme — with a central outlay of Rs 1 lakh crore — is set to be rolled out soon to promote sustainable urban development by transforming cities into growth hubs, fostering creative redevelopment and strengthening water and sanitation infrastructure.The housing and urban affairs ministry has also told the Public Investment Board (PIB), an inter-ministerial panel for appraisal of fully govt-funded schemes, that private developers would be allowed to bring bankable urban infrastructure projects to get financial support under the UCF scheme. These projects must be endorsed by state govts or urban local bodies (ULBs) and the central assistance will be routed through state-level escrow accounts.The UCF was announced in the budget. Under this scheme, while the Centre will provide 25% financial support for bankable projects, 50% will come from bonds, bank loans, and public private partnerships. The remaining 25% will be funded by states and ULBs.As per PIB’s recommendation, the scheme will be applicable to cities with a population of at least 10 lakh, industrial cities with a minimum population of 1 lakh and all state capitals.A separate sub-scheme will be rolled out for all cities and ULBs in hilly states, as well as for ULBs with a population of less than one lakh.To be eligible for support, cities must implement eight broad reforms: operational, governance, tariff, property tax, transit, project financing, planning and building bye-law reforms.On the prospect of private players bringing bankable projects through state govts, experts said the major issue will be operation and maintenance. “If states are unable to get finance for projects from banks with their guarantees, how will private contractors get them? Repayment of bank loans will also be a challenge. Under this model, while the loans will not come under the fiscal limits of state govts, they will attract higher interest rates. Banks will look for some guarantees,” said an expert.",The Urban Challenge Fund (UCF) scheme is set to be rolled out soon.

Dhanteras 2025: Gold purchases decline in volume on high prices; Car deliveries create records,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dhanteras-2025-gold-purchases-decline-in-volume-on-high-prices-car-deliveries-create-records/articleshow/124678609.cms,"AI image

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices





NEW DELHI: The high prices of gold and silver somewhat dampened buyer sentiments this Dhanteras as people purchased more on expectations of a further surge, even as cars, two-wheelers and consumer electronics such as televisions saw strong buying on the day considered auspicious for new purchases.Car deliveries, which peak during Dhanteras, however, were impacted by the fact that the festive day falls on a Saturday this time around. Many consumers prefer not to take delivery of metals on a Saturday.However, car companies say that deliveries still remained strong and will outpace last year’s numbers, especially as a fillip has been provided by the GST duty cuts that led to a significant reduction in retail prices. “We expect overall Dhanteras sales to be around 51,000 units, against 42,000 last year,” said Partho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer (Marketing & Sales) at Maruti Suzuki . “However, since Dhanteras will be spread between Saturday and Sunday this year (ends on 1:18PM on Sunday), we had some customers who will take deliveries on Sunday. So, we retailed 41,000 units today and expect to do another 10,000 tomorrow. This will be the highest-ever number that we will do on Dhanteras.”Tarun Garg, Director & COO at Hyundai India, said the company is witnessing strong customer demand, with deliveries expected to be around 14,000 units, approximately 20% higher than last year. “The positive momentum is driven by the festive spirit, a buoyant market environment and the encouraging impact of GST 2.0 reforms.”In luxury, Mercedes-Benz also saw strong traction. “This Dhanteras not only saw deliveries slightly higher to last year’s levels but we also expect a strong order booking for deliveries on Diwali. Going by the current trends, this should be the best ever October for us,” Santosh Iyer, MD & CEO of Mercedes India said.In gold, with 10 gms prices shooting upwards of Rs 1.3 lakh, the value of purchases was high even though absolute volumes slipped. Silver purchasing is strong. “Value-wise demand is higher on gold but on volumes, it is down 20%. Silver is higher in value and quantity both due to substitution from gold. People are still buying as they expect prices to be headed towards an uptrend,” Rahul Gupta, CMD PP Jewellers & Diamonds, said.Rajesh Rokde, Chairman of Gem and Jewellery Council of India (GJC), said Dhanteras 2025 has seen a 10–15% dip in volume compared to last year. “… but overall value is up sharply. We expect festive sales to cross Rs 50,000 crore. Despite high gold and silver prices, consumer sentiment is strong, driven by strategic buying and early wedding purchases. Gold coins are leading demand, with hallmark-certified lightweight jewellery also performing well. ”Arun Narayan, SVP at Tanishq, said the festive season has been “uniformly strong” across markets, with encouraging responses from metros as well as Tier-2 and Tier-3 towns. “We’re seeing a healthy mix of purchases — from investment-driven buys above Rs 2 lakh to high demand for lightweight jewellery and gold coins around Dhanteras… the response to our gold recycling and exchange initiative has been outstanding. All indicators suggest that demand will continue through the post-festive wedding season as well.”TV sales have been strong on the back of GST cut on bigger screens. “We have been informed that this year’s Navratri season witnessed record-breaking sales in the electronics sector, registering a 20–25% increase compared to last year. All major retail chains have reported unprecedented demand across product categories — from TVs and washing machines to smartphones and air conditioners. Notably, 85-inch televisions were completely sold out, and many families upgraded their appliances to newer models, reflecting rising consumer confidence and purchasing power,” Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.","Car deliveries, which peak during Dhanteras, were impacted by the fact that the festive day falls on a Saturday this time around.

'Climate change: We are getting global north to pay for Indian farmers to adapt',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/climate-change-we-are-getting-global-north-to-pay-for-indian-farmers-to-adapt/articleshow/124675090.cms,"Shantanu Agarwal, founder of Mati Carbon

It sounds almost fantastical — spreading a widely available rock onto agricultural soil to remove carbon from the air while increasing yields for farmers. US-based Shantanu Agarwal, founder of Mati Carbon , says it’s not just possible, it’s happening on Indian farms. The IIT grad, who made it to this year’s Time100 Next list and won the $50m XPRIZE, speaks to Ketaki Desai on why his solution could be a game-changer

I believe the idea for using mati (soil) to capture carbon came from a visit to India. Can you tell us about that?

For a layperson, how would you explain enhanced rock weathering?



So, Mati’s approach doesn’t just cut emissions — it actively removes carbon?

How challenging was it to convince farmers to try this?

You opted not to take venture capital funds for this. Why was that?

There is an inequity here — while the global north contributes the most to climate change , the global south often bears the impact. So, your model flips that equation?

How did the XPRIZE change your plans?





After working in oil and gas, and then a climate-centric venture capital fund, I was looking to create an impact as the climate emergency was only growing. I started a direct air capture (DAC) company, which removes carbon from air and sequesters it into earth’s crust. While the technology is interesting, it is also very energy-intensive, making scaling up challenging. At the same time, I was visiting small-holder farmers in Chhattisgarh as part of a nonprofit I had donated to. I realised that a lot of them were getting lower and lower productivity because of degrading soil. I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, took some samples of rock and soil to figure out if there was viability in doing enhanced rock weathering. When I did the testing with our partners at Yale University, the results came positive. I went full-time into this as I felt this could be a massive win for climate and, at the same time, solve millions of farmers’ adaptation challenges.It’s actually nature’s own carbon capture system. Rock weathering is how all soil is formed — over millions of years, rocks break down through reactions with rainwater and carbon dioxide in the air.Think of fizzy water. If you wash your toilet bowl with it, all that white scale, which is calcium carbonate, gets dissolved and cleaned with the acid water. The CO2 and water in the fizzy drink makes a dilute acid called carbonic acid, which reacts with calcium carbonate and the bowl gets cleaned. Now, this is happening in nature at a massive scale because there is CO2 in the air, and water in rain, which is dissolving rocks into finer and finer powder over millions of years. Today, more than 200 million tons of carbon are removed by the planet itself due to rock weathering.At Mati, we enhance this process by predominantly using basalts. Basalt is a silicate rock, which India is blessed to have a large amount of, because the whole Deccan Plateau is essentially a silicate rock formation. When you take these rocks, powder them and put them in agricultural fields, the nutrients get released and rejuvenate degraded soil. As many as 65% of farmers in the first season itself reported that they didn’t need pesticides anymore. Less than a fraction of 1% of the rocks in the Deccan Plateau can remove all the human-generated CO2.Emission reduction is a very important piece of the overall picture, but carbon removal is also very important. If we want to be a net zero species by 2050, which is what the target is, there is going to be a need for 5 to 10 billion tonnes of carbon removal per annum. If we were doing amazingly on emission reduction, then we could maybe argue that carbon removal doesn’t need as much attention. The later we do emission reduction, the more carbon removal we need. Both need to happen at a massive scale.We work with about 25,000 farmers today. If you tell them that you’re going to give them something for free and it will improve your productivity, they will ask, what’s in it for you? You have to show it to them that this actually works. We typically try to first convince existing trust networks in thatarea, which could be an NGO or farmer organisation, and then we explain to farmers. In the first season, 4-5 people try it out. By season three, everybody wants it. Right now, in India, we are rationing it because we are so oversubscribed.I had a choice: to take VC funding or do without it. But I knew that if we took VC funding, then our mission would become making returns for the venture capitalists, and it would not be about the farmer anymore. So, I decided to raise philanthropic money. The farmers we are dealing with are very poor farmers, so we are not charging them anything. We sell carbon credits to clients in the Global North to fund this.That is the beauty of this solution. We are getting the global north to pay for climate adaptation for small-holder farmers in the global south. The largest and most profitable companies in the global north buy these carbon credits, which allows us to fund the smallest and most climate vulnerable people so that they’re able to pay off debts, improve seed quality, soil quality, and increase income.Our ambition was to expand slowly, but the prize has allowed us to truly try to make this a planetary-scale solution. This year alone, we will increase farmer income by about $4.5m. The goal is to support 100m farmers by 2050.","US-based Shantanu Agarwal, founder of Mati Carbon, says it's not just possible, it’s happening on Indian farms.

GST rate cuts: 30 daily-use items see bigger-than-expected price drops; government monitoring prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-rate-cuts-30-daily-use-items-see-bigger-than-expected-price-drops-government-monitoring-prices/articleshow/124675091.cms,"Representative image





Post the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate cuts effective September 22, prices of 30 out of 54 daily-use items monitored by the government have seen more-than-expected reductions, while others are yet to fully reflect the intended benefits.The government is working with industry players to ensure further retail price drops where needed.As per news agency PTI, the items monitored include essentials such as butter, ghee, cheese, soap, shampoo, AC machines, and TVs.Government data from 21 CGST zones showed that products like ACs, TVs, tomato ketchup, cheese, and cement recorded larger-than-expected price cuts, while notebooks, chocolates, hair oil, toothpaste, pencils, thermometers, and bicycles saw smaller-than-anticipated reductions.Effective September 22, GST adopted a two-tier structure of 5 per cent and 18 per cent, with a 40 per cent rate for ultra-luxury items. Earlier, GST rates ranged from 5 to 28 per cent plus a compensation cess on luxury goods, covering 375 items from toothpaste and shampoo to cars and TVs.Among food items, dried fruits, cheese, condensed milk, jam, tomato ketchup, soya milk drinks, and bottled water witnessed price cuts exceeding expectations, while butter and ghee showed scope for additional reductions.Toiletries such as shampoo, toothbrush, talcum, and face powder saw larger-than-expected declines, whereas hair oil, toothpaste, shaving cream, and after-shave lotion recorded smaller-than-expected cuts.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the benefits of the GST reduction have been passed to consumers. “For items where price cuts are not as per our estimates, it might have to be brought down a little more for which we will work with the companies,” she noted.Sitharaman added that the department of consumer affairs has received 3,169 complaints related to non-passing of GST benefits, of which 3,075 have been forwarded to CBIC nodal officers, and 94 have already been resolved.A functionality will soon enable direct forwarding of complaints to the chief commissioners of respective zones.","30 out of 54 daily-use items monitored by the government have seen more-than- expected reductions.

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices





Gold prices retreated from record highs on Saturday, dropping Rs 2,400 to Rs 1,32,400 per 10 grams in the national capital, even as consumers thronged jewellery stores across India to mark Dhanteras On Friday, 24-carat gold of 99.9 per cent purity had surged by Rs 3,200 to an all-time high of Rs 1,34,800 per 10 grams.In the local bullion market, gold of 99.5 per cent purity also fell by Rs 2,400 to Rs 1,31,800 per 10 grams, down from Rs 1,34,200.Silver prices extended their losses, tumbling Rs 7,000 to Rs 1,70,000 per kilogram on Saturday, after hitting Rs 1,77,000 on Friday.Despite the price jump, a 62.65 per cent year-on-year increase for gold and 70.51 per cent for silver compared to last Dhanteras, demand remained robust, reflecting strong festive sentimentTraders attributed the correction to weak global cues and profit-booking following a steep rally.“The festive fervour of Dhanteras upheld its sheen with a robust turnaround by consumers to invest in the yellow metal. Irrespective of the sky-high price of gold, favourable economic conditions and the GST reforms, there has been a tremendous response,” Colin Shah, managing director of Kama Jewelry, said, as per news agency PTI.He added that lighter jewellery, especially for younger buyers, saw significant traction, while bullion purchases remained strong.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said gold and silver sales alone accounted for Rs 60,000 crore, a 25 per cent rise from last year, with Delhi’s bullion markets recording over Rs 10,000 crore in sales.Pankaj Arora, CAIT’s jewellery chapter national president, called the past two days “an unprecedented rush in jewellery markets”.Inderbir Singh Jolly, CEO of PL Wealth Management, noted that gold continues to benefit from multiple factors such as a weaker dollar, expected US Federal Reserve rate cuts, and central bank accumulation.“India's investment share of gold demand is rising, with buyers gravitating toward coins and bars over expensive jewellery as fabrication costs bite,” he said.Internationally, spot gold hit a lifetime high of $4,379.44 per ounce on Friday before slipping 1.76 per cent to $4,249.98 per ounce, while spot silver declined 4.36 per cent to $51.90 per ounce after reaching $54.49 earlier in the session.N S Ramaswamy, head of commodities & CRM, Ventura, said consumers are increasingly choosing design-rich ornaments and lightweight gold coins amid record prices, with festive sales value rising 12-18 per cent despite lower quantities.","Gold prices retreated from record highs on Saturday, dropping Rs 2,400 to Rs 1,32,400 per 10 grams in the national capital.

Similarly, silver December futures climbed to a new peak of Rs 1,67,999 per kilogram.The rally in precious metals is attributed to growing concerns over credit stress at U.S. regional banks, prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets. Gold prices hit a record $4,378 per ounce, although some profit-taking saw prices stabilize. Despite this, gold is on track for a weekly gain of 7.6%, the largest since early 2020. Silver also reached a new high, reflecting the bullish sentiment.On Thursday, both gold and silver closed on a positive note in domestic and international markets. Gold December futures settled at Rs 1,29,852 per 10 grams, up by 2.08%, while silver December futures ended at Rs 1,67,663 per kilogram, gaining 3.36%.The upward momentum continued as gold prices surpassed $4,300 per troy ounce and silver exceeded $53 per troy ounce in international markets. The decline in the dollar index, US 10-year bond yields falling below 4.0%, and a sell-off in cryptocurrency assets have further supported the rise in gold and silver prices.Additionally, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts are fueling the bullish trend.Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research noted that global central banks and ETF investors are increasingly investing in safe-haven assets, supporting the uptrend.

Sfeer Loyalty Program: A community-centric approach

Hafawa Lounge: Riyadh Air’s first premium ground experience

Strategic significance: Vision 2030 and the aviation push









Saudi Arabia’s newest national airline, Riyadh Air, is preparing for a strategic soft launch of its first international route — daily flights between Riyadh and London Heathrow — beginning October 26, 2025. While tickets won’t be publicly available yet, this tightly managed rollout marks a crucial proving phase as the airline gears up for full-scale commercial operations in 2026.Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a future global aviation leader, with this initial route serving not only as a testbed for systems, aircraft, and service procedures, but also as a key milestone in the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy.Riyadh Air’s first operational route will connect King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with London Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest and most tightly controlled hubs. But these initial flights won’t be open for general ticket sales. Instead, the seats will be available exclusively to Riyadh Air employees, staff at the airline’s owner — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) — and their families.The reason for this controlled opening is strategic. While the airline secured a pair of coveted Heathrow slots back in June for the Northern Hemisphere winter season, it does not yet have its own aircraft. Riyadh Air’s order with Boeing for 72 Dreamliners — 39 firm orders for the 787-9 model and 33 options — originally targeted first deliveries by December 2024. That schedule has now been pushed back due to production delays, with the first jets now expected in late 2025.To avoid losing the Heathrow slots under the airport’s strict “use it or lose it” rules, Riyadh Air is launching the route using a leased Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Oman Air. The aircraft, named Jamila and registered as HZ-RXX, is currently being used for pilot training, certification flights, and operational trials.Passengers on these early flights will be considered “Launch Members” and will be invited to share detailed feedback on every part of the journey — from booking and boarding to in-flight experience and ground handling. Tickets for these flights will only be available through the airline’s newly unveiled loyalty platform, Sfeer.Speaking at the official announcement, Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas made it clear that this staged approach is a deliberate choice, not a compromise.“If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won’t,” he said. “So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.”The new Riyadh–London route spans 3,070 miles with a flight time of approximately 7 hours, making Riyadh Air the fourth airline to operate on this corridor.While Saudia currently maintains a strong presence on the route, it is gradually withdrawing from Riyadh-based services to make way for Riyadh Air, which will become the Kingdom's flagship international airline.Though Riyadh Air is just beginning operations, its long-term ambitions are substantial. The airline was officially announced in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a cornerstone of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, an economic diversification plan that seeks to position Riyadh as a global business and tourism hub.Riyadh Air plans to serve over 100 destinations worldwide by 2030, supported by a modern, fuel-efficient fleet and a focus on premium service across every touchpoint. The scale of its ambition is reflected in its extensive aircraft order book:Riyadh Air’s expansion plans are backed by a massive and diversified aircraft order portfolio:This strategic mix aims to equip the airline with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet for both regional and long-haul destinations.Following the launch of its first route to London, Riyadh Air’s next confirmed destination will be Dubai International Airport. The Riyadh–Dubai corridor is among the busiest in the region, with more than 30 daily flights at peak times, operated by a mix of low-cost and full-service carriers. This route will also mark Riyadh Air’s first direct competition with Emirates, which currently operates three daily Boeing 777-300ER services on the same sector.In parallel, Riyadh Air has been forming strategic partnerships to expand its global reach, including a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore potential codesharing and loyalty program alignment.Alongside the launch announcement, Riyadh Air introduced Sfeer, a digital-first loyalty program designed to reflect modern user behavior and local cultural values. The name — which means “ambassador” in Arabic and echoes the English word “sphere” — captures the program’s vision of building a connected and collaborative member community.Unlike traditional airline programs that reward individual travel spend, Sfeer promotes engagement, inclusivity, and shared progress. Members can share level points with family and friends, advancing together toward higher tiers — a model the airline says reflects Saudi values of generosity and togetherness.In its early access phase, Sfeer is open to Riyadh Air’s internal community, but it will be expanded in phases. Early registrants, dubbed “Founders,” will gain priority access to ticket sales on upcoming flights and invitations to exclusive events. When fully launched in 2026, the program will include gamified challenges, member leaderboards, and a no-expiry points policy. Additional benefits will include complimentary onboard Wi-Fi and special partner offers.Douglas positioned Sfeer as a loyalty program that goes beyond points.“We’re emphasizing inclusivity and engagement, rather than the individual transactional models of traditional airline loyalty programs,” he said. “We want this to be community-driven and digitally immersive — not just another points system.”Riyadh Air has also unveiled its first premium lounge, the ‘Hafawa Lounge’ — located between Terminals 1 and 2 at King Khalid International Airport.The lounge is positioned as an extension of Riyadh Air’s commitment to providing a luxury experience and serves as part of its overall operational trial period. As the airline ramps up toward full public service, every touchpoint, from lounge to inflight, is being tested and refined.Riyadh Air was established in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 — the national strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing reliance on oil. The airline’s objectives are closely aligned with the broader ambitions of its owner, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which include transforming Riyadh into a global aviation hub, attracting 330 million passengers annually by 2030, and enhancing international connectivity through strategic partnerships.One such partnership includes a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore future code-sharing agreements and potential loyalty program integration. Riyadh Air forms just one part of the PIF’s expansive investments in the aviation ecosystem, which also span airports, logistics, and supporting infrastructure across the Kingdom.","Riyadh Air will launch its first London flights on October 26 using a leased Boeing 787-9 for staff only.

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices





HSBC on Friday projected that gold prices could surge to $5,000 an ounce in the first half of 2026, driven by geopolitical risks, economic uncertainty, and a wave of new market participants.As per news agency Reuters, the bank also raised its average gold price forecast for 2025 to $3,455 per ounce from $3,355, while its 2026 average estimate was lifted to $4,600 per ounce from $3,950.“Unlike previous rallies, we believe many of these new buyers are likely to stay in the gold space — even after the rally ends — not so much for appreciation necessarily as for gold’s diversification and ‘safe haven’ qualities,” HSBC said in a research note.The bank highlighted that robust central bank purchases, rising ETF inflows, expectations of US rate cuts, and tariff-related uncertainties have fueled the current rally.Spot gold recently breached the $4,300 mark, marking its strongest weekly gain since December 2008.HSBC expects prices to remain elevated through early 2026, although volatility and some moderation could occur in the second half of the year.“The bull market is likely to continue to press prices higher for 1H’26 and we could very well reach a high of $5,000/oz some time in 1H 2026,” the note added.Other major banks share a similarly bullish outlook. Bank of America and Societe Generale have also forecast gold reaching $5,000 per ounce next year, while ANZ predicts a peak near $4,600 by June 2026, with gradual easing thereafter, reported ET.Analysts attribute the rally to continued safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions, economic policy uncertainty, and expectations of a weakening US dollar.The sustained demand is expected from central banks, institutional funds, and retail investors seeking diversification and protection against economic volatility.HSBC and other analysts underscore that gold’s appeal is not just speculative but rooted in its long-term store-of-value and risk-hedging qualities, reinforcing its role as a key asset amid global uncertainties, as per Reuters.Gold’s trajectory in 2025 and 2026 is being closely watched by markets worldwide, with forecasts indicating that the metal is poised to stay above $4,000 an ounce for the foreseeable future, even as short-term fluctuations occur.","HSBC projects that gold prices could surge to $5,000 an ounce in the first half of 2026.

Public reception







Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy.The bill was presented in August. It removes the income tax obligation for families earning up to 140,000 zloty (€32,973) per year. It applies to all parents with legal responsibility for children, including legal guardians and foster parents.According to calculations by the presidency, an average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief. However, the full impact of the law will only be visible in the 2026 tax return, which will be filed in 2027.The reform is part of a broader effort to reduce the tax burden on families, increase disposable income, encourage professional activity, and stimulate consumption. Nawrocki made zero personal income tax (PIT) a central promise during his presidential campaign. He first announced the measure in March as part of his ""Contract with the Poles,"" pledging to implement it from the first day of his presidency. After winning the June run-off, he signed the bill in August 8 before sending it to the Sejm, Poland’s parliament.Zero PIT is also part of a package known as the ""tax armour,"" which includes a reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the abolition of capital gains tax, and the introduction of a quota-based pension indexation.Experts note that the benefits of the new tax law are likely to be greater for wealthier families. Piotr Juszczyk, chief tax adviser at inFakt, said, “Low-income families, who pay little or no income tax, will gain a negligible amount while those with high incomes will benefit the most.”Families earning 7,000 zloty (€1,648) a month can expect a relief of around 395 zloty (€93) per month, while those earning 12,000 zloty (€2,826) per month could save 913 zloty (€215) monthly, or over 11,000 zloty (€2,590) annually. Families earning the lowest national income will see only minimal savings, and those already below the tax-free threshold will see no change.Public outlook was largely positive. During consultations on 11 September, 476 people participated, with 76% supporting the new law and 66% approving the economic and financial assessment presented by the president. Only a small minority, around 16%, expressed strong opposition.","Poland's president Karol Nawrocki has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.

US auto tariffs: Donald Trump offers American car makers additional relief; truck parts face 25% duty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-auto-tariffs-donald-trump-offers-us-car-makers-additional-relief-truck-parts-face-25-duty/articleshow/124654049.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Friday signed an order that provides relief for American carmakers while introducing a 25% tariff on truck parts.The White House said the order extends an arrangement allowing companies to reduce tariffs on imported vehicle parts. At the same time, it imposes a 25% tariff on medium and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, starting November 1.The moves follow a Section 232 investigation this year into truck imports, launched to assess their impact on national security. Trump has previously used such investigations under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminium to autos. The goal is to encourage domestic manufacturing and penalise countries he believes are taking advantage of the US.Currently, firms importing parts for vehicles built in the US can offset 3.75% of a car’s list price. This benefit was due to be gradually reduced and then ended, but the new order extends the 3.75% offset through 2030 without change.A similar system will now apply to medium and heavy-duty trucks. Officials cited by AFP said that the measures are designed to reward US-based production.Despite the new 25% tariff on imported trucks, senior US officials told journalists some trucks will still get preferential treatment under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Around 78% of heavy truck imports come from Mexico and 15% from Canada, according to Capital Economics. Under the new rules, only the non-US content of USMCA-eligible trucks will face the tariff. Eligible parts will enter duty-free until the Commerce Department sets rules to assess their non-US content.Imported buses will face a 10% tariff and will not qualify for USMCA benefits, officials added.The tariffs come amid ongoing trade talks with Canada and Mexico. The levies are already affecting Mexico, with exports of heavy vehicles to the US dropping nearly 26% year-on-year between January and August.","The White House said the order extends an arrangement allowing companies to reduce tariffs on imported vehicle parts.

China and US might be set for of more negotiations as both countries agree to hold a fresh round of trade talks ""as soon as possible.""

"FAA nod for 737 Max: Two years after door plug incident, Boeing allowed to hike production; max output limit 42 per month",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/faa-nod-for-737-max-two-years-after-door-plug-incident-boeing-allowed-to-hike-production-max-output-limit-42-per-month/articleshow/124651860.cms,"



Boeing on Friday received green light from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase monthly production of its 737 Max aircraft, following reviews and inspections.The plane maker can now make 42 jets per month, up from the previous limit of 38. The cap had been introduced after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines plane in January 2024, sparking renewed concerns about Boeing’s safety standards.Although the FAA set the limit last year, Boeing’s actual production fell below the ceiling for a long stretch. Investigations and a machinists’ strike, which halted work for almost eight weeks, slowed output. By the second quarter of this year, however, Boeing reached the cap and signalled it would ask regulators for permission to produce more.A Boeing spokesperson said the company had followed a “disciplined process” to make sure it was ready to scale up safely, working in line with the guidelines and performance goals that it agreed on with the FAA.“We appreciate the work by our team, our suppliers and the FAA to ensure we are prepared to increase production with safety and quality at the forefront,” Boeing said in a statement cited by AFP.The FAA stressed that its decision does not mean reduced oversight. Inspectors will continue to monitor Boeing’s factories, and their work has carried on even during the US government shutdown that began on October 1.The agency recently restored Boeing’s authority to carry out final safety inspections on 737 Max jets and issue flight certificates, something it was not allowed to do for more than six years.The FAA assumed control of approvals in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the then-new model killed 346 people. Investigators later blamed a software system created by Boeing for the accidents.Boeing’s production plans have also been under political scrutiny. Earlier this year, CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared before a Senate committee, where lawmakers pressed him on whether safety was being prioritised over profit, AFP reported.""Just to be very clear, we won’t ramp up production if the performance isn’t indicating a stable production system,"" Ortberg said during a hearing in April.“We will continue to work on getting to a stable system.”The Alaska Airlines incident was one of several alleged safety breaches at Boeing between September 2023 and February 2024. The FAA is seeking $3.1 million in fines from the company over these violations.","Boeing can now make 42 jets per month, up from the previous limit of 38.

"US chamber of commerce sues Trump administration over $100,000 H-1B fee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-chamber-of-commerce-sues-trump-administration-over-100000-h-1b-fee/articleshow/124627901.cms,"File photo

TOI correspondent from Washington:

‘Not An Annual Fee’: White House Issues Clarification Amid Confusion Over H-1B Visa Fee Order





Corporate America, for long pally with Republican dispensations in Washington, is suing the Trump administration over the $100,000 annual fee for H1B visa, saying the astronomical hike in charges is misguided, unlawful, and detrimental to US businesses.In a federal lawsuit filed before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, which counts giants like Microsoft, WalMart, Exxon Mobil, Amazon, and Pfizer among its members, said the Trump administration has exceeded its statutory authority in announcing the new fee and sought an immediate injunction to block the policy's enforcement.The lawsuit targets a presidential proclamation issued last month, titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,"" which fundamentally re-engineers the financial structure of the H-1B program. Under the new rule, new H-1B visa petitions, primarily for foreign workers outside the US (about 70 percent of whom come from India), must be accompanied or supplemented by a $100,000 payment.Arguing that the new fee blatantly contravenes the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) which governs the H-1B program, the lawsuit contends that a $100,000 tab countermands Congress's judgment that the program should provide a pathway for up to 85,000 people annually to contribute their talents to the United States.By unilaterally imposing such an extreme financial barrier, the Chamber argues that the President has unlawfully usurped legislative authority designed to manage the flow of skilled workers.While the Chamber is dominated by corporate giants, Neil Bradley, its Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer stressed the disproportionate harm the fee will inflict on smaller enterprises. ""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and mid-sized businesses, to utilize the H-1B program,"" Bradley said in a statement. For many start-ups, a $100,000 fee per new employee represents an unsustainable burden that will force them to forgo H1Bs at a time when there is a shortage of qualified STEM graduates in America.The Trump administration has however vigorously defended the measure, asserting it a ""necessary, initial, incremental step"" aimed at ensuring the visa is used strictly to recruit ""great engineers"" and highest-paid talent, rather than for entry-level positions. The policy is rooted in the administration’s core argument -- drummed by some MAGA activists -- that some employers have exploited H-1B loopholes to suppress American wages, displace U.S. workers, and ""spam the system"" by filing high volumes of petitions for lower-skilled roles.Critics warn though that the punitive financial barrier risks triggering a reverse ""brain drain,"" pushing highly sought-after foreign talent toward economic rivals abroad. China and Germany among other nations have opened their doors to foreign talent, and many Indian professionals navigating the uncertain H1B scenario are looking to peel off to neighboring Canada or return home. The Chamber asserts that diminishing the U.S ability to attract and retain the ""world's best and brightest"" threatens the competitiveness and expansion of American companies in the global marketplace.The lawsuit represents a remarkable rift between the Chamber and the Republican White House – allies for long – amid growing disquiet in corporate circles over what some have dubbed as “Right Wing Socialism.” Conservative commentators are flagging actions like President Trump using emergency powers to impose tariffs, the government taking a stake in private corporations like Intel, and hiking H1B fees, saying the moves go against the spirit of free market enterprise that has long characterized the United States.","The U.S Chamber of Commerce is suing the Trump administration over the $100,000 annual fee for H1B visa.

The global economy is going through a period of enhanced turmoil with the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump . Amidst this uncertainty, International Monetary Fund IMF ) MD Kristalina Georgieva has said that world leaders and central bank governors need to ‘buckle up’.Deepak Ajwani, Editor, Economic Times Online asked IMF what that entails. Pierre Olivier Gourinchas, Chief Economist, International Monetary Fund replied with a four-pronged strategy.“We've been living for the last five, seven years, in an environment in which the global economy is hit by fairly sizable shocks. They can be very concentrated. We can think of covid that was the one in maybe in 100 years, a type of shock. But even after that, with the cost of living crisis, we had the impact of military conflict on European soil. You had the trade tensions. All of these things are disruptive to the global economy. ” he told ET.“Now, for many countries in the world, these things are outside their control. These are not something that you directly have an input and can do something about. So the first part of buckling up is to make sure your economy is as resilient as it can be.And how would you make your economy resilient? Well, number one, you make sure that you have the fiscal buffers that you need, because you're going to need to use them when you're hit by one of these shocks, and if you don't have them, then the impact is going to be much larger. So make sure you protect the fiscal buffers,” he said.“Second, make sure that you have the right institutional environment, so that you have institutions that are trusted, that can do their job, that have frameworks that are strong. That is also going to be helpful in maintaining expectations, in maintaining some sense of stability in the economy,” he elaborated.Pierre Olivier Gourinchas is of the view that countries have to be open to deepening trade ties. “You're going to have to rely on trading partners. No country is an island that can do things on their own, and so making sure that countries remain part of the global economy, that they are integrated, that they find ways to deepen trade ties with partners where it's possible, is an important part also of building that resilience,” he said.“And fourth, growth comes from the private sector. It comes from adoption of technologies that have been developed elsewhere. Most countries are not at the frontier of innovation. Most countries are inside that frontier and catching up with it, or developing that frontier, making sure that the right efforts are made in terms of scaling the labor force in terms of adoption of technology in terms of infrastructure investment so that countries can grow rapidly and unleash private sector innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added.The International Monetary Fund announced on Tuesday that the United States and worldwide economies are expected to demonstrate stronger growth this year than earlier predictions, as the impact of Trump-era tariffs has been less severe than anticipated, although the complete effects remain to be seen.According to the IMF's influential World Economic Outlook semi-annual report, the American economy is projected to grow by 2 per cent in 2025. This represents an increase from the previous forecasts of 1.9 per cent in July and 1.8 per cent in April.The IMF's projections indicate that the US economy will expand by 2.1 per cent in the following year, marginally higher than their earlier prediction by one-tenth of a percentage point.The worldwide economic growth forecast has been revised upwards to 3.2 per cent for this year, improving from the July estimate of 3 per cent. For 2026, the IMF maintains its previous projection of 3.1 per cent growth.",IMF Chief Economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas says world leaders and central bank governors need to 'buckle up' He says the first part of buckling up is to make sure your economy is as resilient as it can be.

Spirit Airlines announced on Thursday its decision to furlough 365 pilots and downgrade the status of up to 170 pilots in the first quarter of 2026, as part of a broader workforce reduction strategy amid ongoing restructuring efforts.The ultra-low-cost carrier, which filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year this past August, informed the pilots' union of its intention to cut $100 million in annual pilot-related expenses to preserve cash reserves, reported Reuters. ""In line with our ongoing restructuring, we are implementing further measures to align staffing levels with our previously announced capacity reductions and a smaller operating fleet,"" Spirit Airlines stated.Chief operating officer John Bendoraitis, in a memo obtained by Reuters, indicated that the number of furloughs might decrease in the coming weeks due to voluntary attrition. The company plans to open the bid process at the end of November.Currently, Spirit Airlines employs approximately 2,400 pilots. The airline had previously furloughed around 330 pilots and is set to furlough an additional 270 in November. Additionally, Spirit plans to furlough about 1,800 flight attendants, representing roughly one-third of its cabin crew, effective December 1.The Florida-based airline also announced impending reductions across its corporate teams and intends to make staffing adjustments at its maintenance stations based on volume. The carrier will also close its maintenance stations and warehouse operations in Baltimore and Chicago, effective January 1, 2026.In a recent filing, Spirit Airlines projected that the furloughs would save the company $211 million. The airline anticipates incurring losses of $804 million in 2025 and stated that its transformation plan aims to return to profitability by 2027, necessitating a network reduction in 2026.","Spirit Airlines announced on Thursday its decision to furlough 365 pilots and downgrade the status of up to 170 pilots in the first quarter of 2026.

'Showed up uninvited': Bessent on China trade negotiator

Bessent’s claims at odds with China





In a sign of growing US-China trade tensions, America’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday called Beijing’s trade official ‘unhinged’, likening him to a wolf warrior - a term normally used for aggressive Chinese diplomats.The stabilising US-China diplomatic relations deteriorated recently following American expansion of technology restrictions and proposed tariffs on Chinese vessels at US ports. Beijing retaliated with corresponding measures, including stricter controls on exports of rare earths and other strategic materials.According to a Bloomberg report, Bessent criticised a senior Chinese trade representative, accusing him of arriving in Washington without invitation and displaying aggressive behaviour characteristic of China's confrontational diplomatic approach.Bessent claimed that Li Chenggang's visit to Washington on August 28 was not authorised by the Donald Trump administration. During a Wednesday press conference, the Treasury chief suggested the vice minister's arrival with provocative rhetoric might indicate independent action.“Perhaps the vice minister who showed up here with very incendiary language on August 28 has gone rogue,” he said.Bessent's criticism targeted one of China's most distinguished trade specialists.Li, who serves as vice minister, holds advanced legal credentials, specifically a Master of Laws qualification from the University of Hamburg in Germany.Bessent expressed strong disapproval of Li's conduct, describing it as disrespectful. During an event, Bessent incorrectly pronounced Li's name as ""Kuanggong"" and called him ‘low level’, despite Li holding full ministerial status in China.Li, aged 58, was designated as China's vice minister of commerce and trade envoy in April, following Trump's announcement of huge Liberation Day tariffs. Working alongside He Lifeng, China's chief trade negotiator, Li has been central to multiple negotiation sessions between the two leading global economies.During his tenure as China's representative to the World Trade Organization in Geneva from February 2021 until his April appointment, Li demonstrated his negotiation skills. Keith Rockwell, a former WTO spokesperson who interacted with Li, describes him as resolute yet measured in his approach.Li established himself as an astute diplomat with comprehensive knowledge during his role leading China's discussions with the Obama administration regarding a bilateral investment agreement.""He knew his stuff"" and ""didn't allow the US to push him around,"" Rockwell shared with Bloomberg News earlier this year.""Chinese officials seldom go rogue, and those that do, tend to end up out of a job especially under Xi Jinping 's heavily centralized rule,"" Thomas said. ""So it's highly unlikely that Li's actions were anything other than approved by Xi in Beijing.""China's Commerce Ministry released a statement on Thursday indicating that Bessent had severely misrepresented the facts. According to spokesperson He Yongqian, Li visited the United States to pursue discussions that followed the earlier discussions between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.Recent diplomatic exchanges between China and the US have continued, with China putting forward proposals. However, he noted that the US's unreceptive response on shipping issues has compelled China to implement retaliatory measures.China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed that in late August, Li travelled to Washington for meetings with treasury, commerce and trade officials. The ministry's statement noted that during this visit, he stressed the ""principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.""Lin Jian, the spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, emphasised that their nation's stance on trade matters remained ""consistent and clear.""""The US should work with China to resolve relevant issues through dialogue and consultation based on equality, mutual respect and reciprocity, rather than repeatedly resorting to pressure and threats,"" he said.According to the Bloomberg report, Bessent offered a contrasting account, indicating that Li had cautioned about potential ""global chaos"" if the United States proceeded with implementing port fees on Chinese vessels. ""Maybe he thinks he's a wolf warrior,"" he stated.Neil Thomas, Fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, is of the view that Bessent aims to convey to Xi that easing recent export restrictions could facilitate an agreement with President Trump.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticised a senior Chinese trade representative, accusing him of arriving in Washington without invitation and displaying aggressive behaviour.

Gold soared to record levels as renewed concerns over US credit quality and escalating US-China tensions drove investors toward safe-haven assets.Gold surged 1.2 per cent to $4,379.93 per ounce on Friday, heading for its biggest weekly gain since 2008 and extending a rally that began in August. The surge was underpinned by expectations of steep Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, which also lifted other precious metals.Meanwhile, Silver also breached its 1980 record on a discontinued Chicago Board of Trade contract, touching $54.38 an ounce before stabilising, as reported by Bloomberg. Palladium and platinum also posted substantial weekly advances.Gold has jumped more than 65 per cent this year, buoyed by central bank buying, ETF inflows, and geopolitical uncertainty. Silver has risen nearly 90 per cent, driven by similar factors and a major supply squeeze in London that pushed benchmark prices above New York futures.More than 15 million ounces of silver were withdrawn from Comex-linked warehouses in recent days, reportedly to ease tightness in London. The price gap between the two markets has narrowed to 70 cents per ounce from $3 earlier.As of 7:57 a.m. in Singapore, spot gold was up 1 per cent at $4,369.14 per ounce, bringing its weekly gain to 8.7 per cent.Platinum rose 8 per cent this week, and palladium surged 16 per cent.Market sentiment turned volatile on Thursday after two US regional banks disclosed loan irregularities involving fraud allegations, sparking fresh concerns about borrower stability. The developments, alongside heightened US-China trade tensions and limited economic data amid the Washington shutdown, fuelled safe-haven demand.Investors are increasingly pricing in aggressive rate reductions by year-end, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled another quarter-point cut this month — a backdrop favouring non-yielding assets like gold and silver.Additionally, china’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao blamed Washington for recent diplomatic strains, warning against economic decoupling. His remarks followed US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s criticism of a Chinese trade official’s surprise Washington visit as “unhinged”.","Gold surged 1.2 per cent to $4,379.93 per ounce on Friday, heading for its biggest weekly gain since 2008.

US Chamber of Commerce took legal action against the government’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions on Thursday, saying the move violates existing immigration law.In its complaint, the Chamber argued that the new fee goes beyond the limits set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires visa charges to reflect only the government’s administrative costs. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer, said the steep fee would make it nearly impossible for many US employers, especially start-ups and small businesses to hire skilled foreign workers.""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utiliSe the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the US,"" Bradley said, as per an official release by the US Chamber of Commerce.Bradley also noted that while president Trump’s administration has prioritised border security and economic growth, the Chamber believed the US economy still needed skilled workers to sustain expansion.He said the Chamber supports targeted immigration reforms that simplify the visa process and help retain global talent in the country.""President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,"" it said.The organisation added that it is willing to work with Congress and the administration to create a fairer and more practical system for employers who depend on the H-1B programme.","US Chamber of Commerce took legal action against the government’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions on Thursday.

Jamie Dimon’s View on Gold





Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO, who is long known to be a skeptic on gold investment, has said that he now sees a ‘semi-rational’ in having the yellow metal as part of your investment portfolio.Gold prices have surged significantly, rising from under $2,000 two years ago to remarkable levels, outperforming equity markets in the 21st century. This upward trend reflects investors seeking refuge in secure assets, driven by inflationary pressures and global political tensions.While stating that he is not a buying of gold, Dimon acknowledged that gold prices could go up to as high as $10,000! ""I'm not a gold buyer — it costs 4% to own it,"" Dimon said this week at Fortune's Most Powerful Women conference in Washington.Dimon expressed a measured view on gold ownership whilst acknowledging its potential value in current circumstances.""It could easily go to $5,000, $10,000 in environments like this. This is one of the few times in my life it's semi-rational to have some in your portfolio,” he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.""Asset prices are kind of high,"" Dimon said, and ""in the back of my mind, that cuts across almost everything at this point.""Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel, expressed concern last week about investors increasingly perceiving gold as a more stable alternative to the dollar, describing this shift as ""really concerning.""Goldman Sachs has adjusted its gold price prediction for December 2026 upwards to $4,900 per ounce, an increase from the previous $4,300, attributing this change to significant Western ETF investments and anticipated central bank purchases.""We see the risks to our upgraded gold price forecast as still skewed to the upside on net, because private sector diversification into the relatively small gold market may boost ETF holdings above our rates-implied estimate,"" Goldman said according to a Reuters report.HSBC has increased its projected average gold price for 2025 to $3,355 per ounce from $3,215, attributing the rise to heightened safe-haven interest amidst global political tensions, financial instability, and declining US dollar strength.""Sentiment remains bullish as rallies are expected to continue in 2026 aided by official sector buying and institutional demand for gold as a diversifier,"" the bank stated in a note dated October 15.HSBC revised its gold price projection upward, setting a new average target of $3,950 for 2026, an increase from its previous estimate of $3,125.ANZ's latest analysis predicts gold prices will reach $4,400 per ounce by end-2025, citing several factors including heightened geopolitical tensions, economic instability, financial market uncertainties, and anticipated the Federal Reserve interest rate reductions.The bank expects gold valuations to achieve their highest point around $4,600 per ounce in June 2026, before trending downward in the latter half of 2026, coinciding with the end of the Federal Reserve's easing programme and increased certainty regarding US economic expansion and trade policy directions.","Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO, has said that he now sees a ‘semi- rational’ in having the yellow metal as part of your investment portfolio.

While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use.

Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

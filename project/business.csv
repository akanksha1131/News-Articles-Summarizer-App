NEW DELHI: The defence ministry's recent approval of a Rs 30,000 crore contract for long-range drones is set to revolutionise the UAV manufacturing sector in India, according to Economic Times report. Two manufacturers will share the order, establishing separate production facilities capable of handling future expansions and export opportunities.Defence minister Rajanth Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) has approved the procurement of 87 indigenously manufactured medium altitude long endurance (MALE) drones. These aircraft will perform various functions including reconnaissance, electronic warfare operations and precision strike missions.The armed forces will soon issue an expression of interest for Indian companies to participate in the bidding process. Following this, trials will be conducted before proceeding to final commercial negotiations.According to ET sources, the DAC has determined that the contract should be divided between two competing firms. The total order value, expected to exceed Rs 30,000 crore, will be distributed between the two lowest bidders in a 64:36 ratio, with the primary contractor receiving the larger portion.This arrangement will establish two distinct MALE manufacturing facilities in India, allowing for quick production scaling when required. The selected companies must ensure local manufacturing of aerostructures and primary components, whilst engines must be assembled and tested within India. Additionally, critical military components such as electro optical payloads and satellite communications equipment must be produced domestically to ensure supply chain reliability and security.","The defence ministry's recent approval of a Rs 30,000 crore contract for long- range drones is set to revolutionise the UAV manufacturing sector in India.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are expected to be range-bound in the coming days as the global economic uncertainties continue to weigh. Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors: Gold prices surged to an all-time high on the domestic front last week, driven by rate cut expectations, weaker US jobs report and tariff related uncertainties. Dollar index was in a narrow range of ~98-~99 similarly, US Yields also witnessed some pressure, amidst a strong consumer confidence data was overshadowed by soft July job growth and downward revisions to past payrolls, pointing to a weakening labor market supporting bullion in the previous week.Confusion erupted towards the end of last week after reports of a 39% US tariff on Swiss 1 kg and 100 ounce gold bars, initially spiking prices before the White House clarified the news was false, triggering a pullback. Meanwhile, President Trump announced plans to meet Russian President Putin on August 15 to discuss ending the Ukraine war, while trade talks with China face an August 12 deadline.Trump is also expected to nominate first economist Miran as Fed Governor after Powell’s retirement. Physical gold demand in Asia rose early in the week but fell later due to high prices, while Chinese inflation data disappointed, pressuring industrial metals including silver.Market focus now shifts to key US inflation, retail sales, and IIP data.This week, data points will be important as if US CPI data is reported better than expectations, it means the tariff impact has started to set in prices, as Governor Powell’s expectations and it could once again change the interest rate cut expectations for this year and the next. India forex reserves dropped to the lowest level in 2025, suggesting RBI’s active role in the market and movement in USDINR. This is a holiday shortened week on the domestic front so moves in USDINR will also be important to keep an eye on. Also, President Trump' s comments on the Russia-Ukraine war, tariff updates with India, China and others will be on radar.","Gold prices surged to an all-time high on the domestic front last week, driven by rate cut expectations, weaker US jobs report and tariff related uncertainties.

India seeks to ensure supply of critical minerals!

Supply chain for critical minerals in focus



Plugging gaps

India aims to secure consistent and improved supply of essential minerals including lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements, which are vital for nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defence, telecommunications and advanced electronics sectors. Currently, the supply chain of these minerals is largely dominated by China.The government is expected to present amendments to mining laws in Parliament this week, with the primary focus on enabling state funding for acquiring critical mineral assets abroad.Having secured all required internal governmental approvals, the amendment Bill to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act could be introduced in Parliament as soon as Monday, according to a senior official's statement to ET.The administration intends to utilise funds from the National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) for these acquisitions. The trust presently holds more than ₹6,000 crore, accumulated from mining lease holders who are required to contribute 2% of their applicable royalty to the trust.Established in 2015 to accelerate mineral exploration in India, the organisation has approved projects valued at Rs 4,000 crore.""The change in mandate will allow funds to be used for acquiring overseas assets besides supporting domestic exploration,"" the official said.The NMET fund receives approximately Rs 1,000 crore annually, according to the official, who noted: ""The collection will increase as more mines are operationalised."" The trust's name will be modified to incorporate 'development', reflecting its broader scope encompassing exploration, acquisition and development of critical mineral assets internationally.In January, ET reported that new amendments to the MMDR Act are expected this year, intended to strengthen critical mineral supply chains. The most recent modification to the Act occurred in 2023. ""The amendment will address the core issue of critical mineral raw material availability,"" the official said.The government is exploring options to permit the sale of mineral stockpiles from captive mines through one-time payments. ""There are a number of captive mines where huge dumps of minerals have been accumulated which are not usable due to its low grade or unsuitability for the plants,"" according to a government representative.State authorities have reported that over 50% of extracted minerals prove unsuitable for captive end-use facilities. Current regulations prohibit captive mines from selling these accumulated deposits. The proposed regulatory changes would authorise states to allow the sale of stockpiles within leased areas upon payment of supplementary fees.The administration also aims to streamline regulations for incorporating newly identified minerals and adjacent areas to current mining leases for a prescribed fee. Holders of deep-seated mineral resource leases could request permission to include neighbouring areas, limited to a single application and restricted to 10% of the existing leased space.Mineral extraction from these additional areas would incur a 10% surcharge above the auction premium for auctioned mines. For non-auctioned mines, royalty rates on mineral production from expanded areas would be doubled. Official data shows India's mineral production (excluding atomic, minor and hydrocarbon energy minerals) reached Rs 1.40 lakh crore in fiscal 2023-24, increasing from Rs 1.24 lakh crore in the previous year.","India aims to secure consistent and improved supply of essential minerals including lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements.

US Hits India With Massive 50% Tariff as Donald Trump Retaliates Over Russian Oil Imports

Foreign investment managers display heightened scepticism towards Indian equities, reaching a two-year peak, as the rupee weakens against US tariffs, elevated share valuations and declining corporate profits diminish the appeal of Dalal Street globally.The negative sentiment towards India has led to accelerated foreign withdrawals recently, with their bearish positions in derivatives reaching the highest level since March 2023, further intensified by the 50% tariffs on Indian exports to the US.""Persistent foreign selling, along with short build-up, reflects a clear risk-off approach because of global uncertainties and domestic headwinds,"" said Sudeep Shah, vice-president and head of technical and derivative research, SBI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.However, for positive observers, the low long-short ratio presents potential opportunity. ""From a contrarian perspective, such an extremely low long-short ratio could also signal that the market is oversold in the short term,"" further said Shah. ""Any positive trigger such as easing global tensions or favourable domestic cues could lead to short covering, resulting in a sharp rebound.""Foreign investors have withdrawn nearly Rs 15,990 crore in August, following a Rs 17,740 crore withdrawal in July.In derivatives, the long-short ratio of foreign positions decreased to 8.28%, from 15% in July's third week and 36.7% at the month's start, according to SBI Securities. The long-short ratio indicates traders' positive versus negative positions in index futures.A declining ratio for FPIs' futures positions indicates increased short positions, according to experts. ""The FPI long-short ratio in index futures is indicating one of the most bearish stances in recent times, with nearly 10 shorts for every long position,"" said Ajit Mishra, senior vice president, research, Religare Broking, quoted by ET. This measure ranged between 10% and 20% in late 2024 and early 2025, during heightened pessimism.The Nifty and Sensex have continued their downward trend for six consecutive weeks, the longest such period in five years. The rupee also declined for five straight weeks, reaching 87.65 against the dollar.International investors, already concerned about Indian stocks' high valuations compared to historical averages and emerging market peers, have shown inconsistent behaviour throughout 2025. The Trump administration's additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, bringing total levies to 50%, amongst the highest globally, appears to be directing them towards alternative markets.""A number of other equity markets at this point offer better risk-reward propositions and more certainty compared to Indian equities,"" said Sham Chandak, head of institutional equities at Elios Financial Services. ""Foreign participants in our market sense that with India ending up on the wrong side of tariffs, private capex and in terms consumption is likely to grow slower than anticipated earlier,"" he added.","Foreign investors have withdrawn nearly Rs 15,990 crore in August, following a Rs 17,740 crore withdrawal in July.

"Gold price prediction today: Where are gold rates headed on August 12, 2025? Here’s the outlook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-august-12-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-outlook/articleshow/123248748.cms,"Gold price prediction: Gold is still caught in its nearly 12-week-old range of $3,250-$3,450. (AI image)

Gold Performance:

Spot gold, in the week ending August 8, closed with a gain of around 1.1% at $3397. On August 11, spot gold prices moved between $3,341 and $3,402 as the metal as gold slipped on a stronger US Dollar amid hopes of US-China truce extension and a breakthrough in the US-Russia talks over Ukraine, which are scheduled to take place in Alaska on August 15.

Lack of clarity on import duty on gold exports to the US also contributed to weakness in gold to some extent.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $3,345, down 1.53% for the day. The MCX October gold contract was noted at Rs 100,318, down nearly 1.50%.

Trades and tariffs:

US President Trump said that trade deal talks with China are progressing nicely.

He urged China to quadruple its soybean orders, saying that it will substantially reduce China’s Trade Deficit with the USA.

US Treasury Secretary Bessent expects trade issues to be finished by October.

Trump confirmed that Nvidia will pay 15% of China chip revenues to the US government.

Data roundup:

China's inflation numbers (July) were out on August 9. CPI y-o-y was steady as against the expectation of a decline of 0.1%, while PPI y-o-y at -3.6% (forecast -3.3%) showed that factory gate deflation extended to the 34th consecutive month.

US Dollar Index and yields:

The US Dollar Index gains could be attributed to the upcoming US CPI (July) to be released today, which is likely to show a pickup in inflation pace. The Dollar Index was noted at 98.58, up 0.42% for the day.

Two-year and Ten-year US yields at 3.74% and 4.26% were down by almost 2 bps each. CPI data would be followed by PPI (July) and retail sales advanced (July) scheduled to be released on August 13 and August 15 respectively.

Gold ETF:

As of August 8, total known global gold ETF holdings surged to a new-cycle high of 92.14MOz -- highest since July 2023.

New exploration remains muted despite high gold prices:

As per a report from S&P Global Commodity Insights, despite gold prices surging to new record highs, exploration activity has remained subdued. In 2024, the gold industry added just 3 deposits to its global database, which raised the reserves from 2.9 billion Ounces to 3 billion Ounces. The industry players are preferring to expand known deposits rather than to bet on new projects. That average size of new deposits has come down from 7.7 million ounces in the previous decades to just 4.4 million ounces since 2020 is also limiting the expansion activities.

Fed watch:

Fed’s Bowman (voter) said that the latest job market data underscores her forecast for three rate cuts this year.

Fed Chair list now also includes former St. Louis Fed President Bullard and former George W. Bush adviser Sumerlin.

Upcoming data:

This week is a data-packed week. Additional major US data on the card this week include industrial production (July), import and export price Indices (July) along with University of Michigan sentiment and inflation expectations (August prel.).

Investors will monitor the Eurozone's 2Q (prel.) employment and the secondary reading of 2Q GDP, too.

Gold Price Outlook:

Gold is still caught in its nearly 12-week-old range of $3,250-$3,450.

In the very near term, US CPI and other inflation data, US-China trade truce extension and US-Russia talks over Ukraine will dictate gold prices.

Chances of a positive outcome out of the US-Russia meeting in Alaska on Friday are slim.

US-China trade truce extension and hot CPI data may pressurize the metal further. In that case, gold may slip further to test support at $3,310 (Rs 99,200). Next major support is at $3,292 (Rs 98,700). Resistance is at $3,375 (Rs 101,200) /$3,410 (Rs 102,300). Gold may stabilize after US-China truce extension and US CPI data as retail sales and the US-Russia talks may not be that positive for risk assets.

Reduced annuity returns after rate cuts: LIC chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reduced-annuity-returns-after-rate-cuts-lic-chief/articleshow/123244694.cms,"With both markets and interest rates down, how will you increase returns? Have you repriced any products because of the fall in rates?

LIC's stock is below the IPO price. How will you attract investors if govt wants to dilute? What's your dividend policy?

Is LIC moving towards more profitable products? Why was there a drop in the number of policies?

There was news about LIC picking up a stake in a health insurer. When will the deal conclude? Will you look at composite (life and non-life) insurance?

What's the aspiration in banking after the IDBI stake sale proposal?

Do you plan to grow your market share?

MUMBAI: R Doraiswamy, who took over as MD & CEO of LIC less than a month ago, wants the corporation to retain its position as the largest insurer. He speaks to TOI about LIC's strategies.We are a long-term investor. We look at all market cycles and invest whenever there's an opportunity for value creation. If equities aren't attractive, we invest in other instruments like money market products and wait for the right moment. Short- or medium-term market movements don't affect us because we focus on the long term. We look for value opportunities in equity IPOs as well. Until then, we park funds in short-term investments and shift when we see value. We recently repriced our annuities - both Jeevan Akshay and Jeevan Shanti - towards the end of last month in line with market conditions.We believe LIC deserves a better valuation. Govt is closely watching the market and will take a call on a price when there is enough scope in the market to go for further dilution.They aim to reduce their holding to 90% by 2027 and are working towards that. Dividend distribution will depend on capital and solvency needs. We currently have a solvency ratio above 2, while the requirement as a systemically important insurer is 1.75. The solvency ratio will drop by a few basis points once the regulator implements risk-based capital requirements and IFRS (accounting norms). We've engaged Deloitte as consultants and are preparing for compliance.We've shifted towards non-par products to match market demand, especially from younger customers seeking guaranteed and short-term plans. Our non-par share in premiums has risen from 7% in 2022 to 30%. We will now balance focus between par and non-par products. The decline in policies was because a new master circular in Oct 2024 required us to modify all products, increase the minimum sum assured, and change commission structures. This reduced policy numbers, especially in popular low-ticket plans. We saw a significant degrowth in the number of policies sold during Q3FY25, which continued in Q4 as well as Q1FY26. We're working to recover growth in the second half.We never named any company. We were exploring taking a strategic stake in a standalone health insurer for learning purposes. But as we progressed, we found that we needed to do much more due diligence and expand the options available, examining them in greater depth. So we decided not to make a quick move. We will also wait for changes in insurance laws and other regulatory changes expected in the near future. We have been a pure life insurer since 1972. We'll examine the composite option if laws change, but we have no such plan now.Our vision is to be a transnationally competitive financial conglomerate. We acquired up to 51% of IDBI Bank because their recapitalisation need provided us an opportunity. We are now at 49.2%. Govt and LIC will jointly offload part of our stake during privatisation, but we will retain a significant holding post-sale and continue the relationship.The focus of govt is to allow 100% foreign direct investment so that there are new players. When the market has more players, market share may reduce. We are not looking at market share as a prime focus. We are focusing on continuing to grow sustainably and profitably while expanding the market.","R Doraiswamy, who took over as MD & CEO of LIC less than a month ago, wants the corporation to retain its position as the largest insurer.

US stocks closed with mixed results as the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which affected numerous countries, was relatively subdued in global markets. The S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% after nearing its all-time high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 224 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased by 0.3%, reaching a new record.The S&P 500 experienced a slight decline of 0.1% after momentarily nearing its all-time high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 224 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite saw a 0.3% increase, reaching a new record.Concerns are mounting that President Trump's tariffs are negatively impacting the economy, especially following last week's disappointing job market report. However, optimism surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and a series of unexpectedly strong profit reports from major U.S. companies are helping to alleviate some of these worries, at least temporarily. Lower interest rates can stimulate the economy and boost investment prices, although they also carry the risk of increasing inflation. In a similar move, the Bank of England reduced its main interest rate on Thursday in an effort to support the struggling U.K.economy.The S&P 500 rose 0.5% in early trading, hovering just below its all-time high set last month while Dow gained 200 points and Nasdaq climbed 1%.However, the market eventually plunged into red as DJIA was dipped 355 points or 0.8%, trading at 43,837. Nasdaq followed the suit, falling to 21,157, shredding 0.06% or 12 points.Trump's new tariffs, which took effect Thursday morning, are seen as part of an ongoing trade push that has rattled markets and policymakers globally. Some nations are still in talks to reduce the tax rates on their exports, but for now, uncertainty remains the only constant on Wall Street.On Thursday, the Bank of England cut its main interest rate in an effort to support the struggling UK economy.The latest round of US tariffs, which came into effect on Thursday morning, were already expected and turned out to be lower than Trump had initially warned. Several countries are still trying to negotiate lower tax rates on their exports, while uncertainty continues to loom large on Wall Street.The latest reports on the US economy painted a mixed picture, keeping Treasury yields largely steady in the bond market.One report showed a slight rise in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week. While this may hint at an increase in layoffs, the figure still falls within its usual range.","The S&P 500 experienced a slight decline of 0.1% after momentarily nearing its all-time high earlier in the day.

Goods already in transit or those falling under specific exemptions will be spared.Describing the moment as an opportunity to double down on India’s economic potential, Agarwal said in a post on FICCI’s official X handle:""India has in the past faced multiple challenges and we have through our collective resolve turned adversity into opportunity. It is time that we once again focus all our energies into further strengthening our industrial economy and the services sectors.

Shares of Intel tumbled down on Thursday after US President Donald Trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to China.The INTC was trading at $19.77, down 0.6 points or 3.1% at 10:53 PM IST.“The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.“There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” he further added.Trump’s remarks came shortly after senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel chairman Frank Yeary, raising concerns over CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s business connections.The letter questioned whether Tan had divested his interests in various semiconductor firms that reportedly have links to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military.“In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO,” Cotton wrote in the letter.“Mr Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”The senator specifically highlighted Tan’s recent leadership at Cadence Design Systems, a tech company that had earlier admitted to selling products to China’s National University of Defense Technology in violation of US export rules.“US companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations,” Cotton posted on X.Intel is among the major beneficiaries of President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, having secured over $8 billion in federal funding to support the construction of chip plants across the United States.The company has yet to issue a response to either Trump’s post or Cotton’s letter.Following the controversy, Intel’s stock fell by 3%, even as broader markets, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq, moved higher.Founded in 1968 during the early days of the personal computing era, Intel has struggled in recent years. It failed to keep pace with the mobile revolution sparked by Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and has since fallen behind more agile competitors. The rise of artificial intelligence has only widened that gap, with Nvidia emerging as a dominant force in the chipmaking industry.Now under Tan’s leadership since March, Intel is undergoing major restructuring. The company is cutting thousands of jobs, slashing expenses, and even scaling back some domestic semiconductor manufacturing, all in an effort to turn around its declining fortunes.","US President Donald Trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to China.

A sia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani has once again chosen to draw no salary from Reliance Industries, the oil-to-telecom-to-retail giant he heads, for the fifth consecutive year. Instead, dividend payouts remain his primary source of income, according to a PTI report.According to the latest annual report of Reliance Industries, Ambani, 68, received 'nil' salary, allowances, perquisites, and retiral benefits for the financial year 2024-25 (FY25).Ambani had capped his annual remuneration at Rs 15 crore between from financial year 2009 to 2020.Since FY21, he voluntarily opted to forego his salary due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has continued to do so each year since.Despite not drawing a salary, Ambani, who is currently the 18th richest person in the world with a net worth just under $100 billion, earned Rs 8.85 crore in dividend income from the 1.61 crore shares he directly holds in Reliance. This is based on the Rs 5.50 per share dividend declared by the company for FY25, as reported by PTI.In addition, promoter group firms under Ambani’s control hold 664.5 crore shares, amounting to a 50.07% stake in the company bringing in a combined dividend income of Rs 3,655 crore.The annual report also shed light on the remuneration of other top executives and family members. Ambani’s cousins, Nikhil and Hital Meswani, saw a slight dip in their pay to Rs 25 crore each in FY25, compared to Rs 25.31 crore and Rs 25.42 crore, respectively, in FY24. Their earnings included a commission of Rs 17.28 crore each, unchanged from the past three years, the PTI report said.Executive Director P M S Prasad’s remuneration rose to Rs 19.96 crore in FY25 from Rs 17.93 crore in the previous year. His pay includes performance-linked incentives for FY24, which were disbursed in FY25.Ambani’s three children, Isha, Akash, and Anant, who joined the Reliance board in October 2023 at nil salary, received Rs 6 lakh each as sitting fee and Rs 2.27 lakh each as commission, the PTI report said. In the previous financial year, they had received Rs 4 lakh in sitting fees and Rs 97 lakh in commission.The youngest, Anant Ambani, has since been appointed as an Executive Director on the Reliance board. From this fiscal year, he is expected to earn between Rs 10 crore and Rs 20 crore in salary, the report said.Other notable non-executive directors on the Reliance board include Raminder Singh Gujral, Shumeet Banerji, former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, former CVC K V Chowdary, veteran banker K V Kamath, and Saudi sovereign wealth fund nominee Yasir Othman H Al Rumayyan.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed that his tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil delivered a ""big blow"" to Moscow's economy.Addressing a press briefing, Trump referred to India as Russia's “largest or second-largest oil buyer"" and asserted that the 50% tariffs on India have hit the Russian economy hard.He linked Russia's economic challenges to the ongoing conflict, emphasising that the US's 50 per cent tariff on countries buying Russian oil had a substantial impact. Alluding to India, Trump remarked, ""Their economy is not doing well right now because it's been very well disturbed by this. It doesn't help when the President of the United States tells their largest or second-largest oil buyer that we're putting a 50 per cent tariff on you if you buy oil from Russia. That was a big blow.""Trump mentioned he was ready to take further measures but received a call from Putin. ""I haven't stopped there. I mean, look, I was all set to do things far bigger than that. But I got a call that they'd like to meet, and I'm going to see what they want to meet about.""He described the upcoming meeting with Russia as a ""big deal,"" stating, ""I'll be calling the European leaders. They're tired of it (the Russia-Ukraine war).They want to get back to spending money on their countries. They want to get back to building their own countries. They want it resolved.""The tariffs on India, imposed by Trump, have been a contentious issue between the two nations. The US has levied a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing India's oil imports from Russia.The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move 'unfortunate' and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests. In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""","US President Donald Trump claimed that his tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil delivered a ""big blow"" to Moscow's economy.

Trade war: Will US impose tariffs on gold?

Trump said in a statement on his Truth Social account, without providing further details. His remarks followed confusion triggered by a US Customs and Border Protection letter that appeared to classify two standard gold bar weights — one kilogram and 100 ounces (2.8 kilos) — as subject to duties.According to Reuters, the ruling posted on the customs website last week had raised concerns that Washington might place the most widely traded bullion bars in the United States under country-specific import tariffs, potentially disrupting global supply chains. A White House official told Reuters on Friday that the administration was preparing an executive order “clarifying misinformation” about tariffs on gold bars and other specialty products.The customs letter, dated July 31 and first reported by the Financial Times, had spurred a surge in gold prices, with December delivery contracts hitting a record high on the Comex, the world’s largest futures market. One-kilo bars comprise the bulk of Switzerland’s bullion exports to the United States, and a 39 percent levy under Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs had been seen as a major risk for the European nation, a key refining and transit hub.""Delighted to hear the crisis has been averted,"" independent gold market analyst Ross Norman told Reuters. ""It will come as an enormous relief to the bullion markets, as the potential for disruption was incalculable.""Following Trump’s post, US gold futures fell 2.4 percent to $3,407 per ounce, narrowing the premium over spot gold, which dropped 1.2 percent to $3,357. Shares of Barrick Mining fell 2.8 percent after posting quarterly results, while Newmont, the world’s largest gold miner, slipped slightly to $68.87.Gold, considered a safe-haven asset, has already touched record highs this year amid tariff tensions and geopolitical unrest.(With inputs from Reuters)","US President Donald Trump said on Monday that gold imports will not face additional tariffs.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund — the world’s largest — has announced the sale of its holdings in 11 Israeli companies, citing the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the broader conflict in the region.Nicolai Tangen, chief of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund, said the decision was taken “in response to extraordinary circumstances”, AFP reported.“The situation in Gaza is a serious humanitarian crisis. We are invested in companies that operate in a country at war, and conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have recently worsened,” Tangen said in a statement.Known as the oil fund due to its revenue source from Norway’s vast energy exports, the sovereign fund is valued at around $1.9 trillion and has investments spread across the globe.The move comes days after Norwegian dailyreported that the fund had invested in Israeli Bet Shemesh Engines Holdings, a manufacturer of parts for engines used in Israeli fighter jets. Tangen later confirmed the reports, noting that the stake in the company had even increased after the Gaza offensive began.Following the revelations, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store asked Finance Minister and former Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg to review the matter.NBIM disclosed that at the end of the first half of 2025, it held investments in 61 Israeli companies, of which 11 were not part of its “equity benchmark index” — a reference portfolio set by Norway’s finance ministry to measure the fund’s performance.The wealth fund said it decided last week to sell all such off-benchmark holdings in Israeli firms “as soon as possible”.It also stressed that it has “long paid particular attention to companies associated with war and conflict”, noting that since 2020 it has engaged with over 60 companies on such issues, including 39 linked to the West Bank and Gaza.Monitoring of Israeli firms was stepped up in autumn 2024, NBIM said, and has already led to divestments from several companies.",Norway's sovereign wealth fund has announced the sale of its holdings in 11 Israeli companies.

A Hong Kong High Court has issued a liquidation order for China South City Holdings Ltd., marking the largest Chinese construction company by assets to face winding up since China Evergrande Group.This court decision exemplifies the ongoing impact of China's property sector crisis on major real estate firms. Despite governmental support measures, residential sales remain subdued, suggesting a delayed recovery. UBS Group AG has revised its earlier optimistic outlook, now anticipating a postponed revival unless Beijing implements additional economic support.Judge Linda Chan delivered the verdict after the petitioner requested immediate liquidation proceedings. Despite China South City's plea for an additional opportunity, the judge noted the absence of meaningful advancement in their restructuring plans, according to a Bloomberg report.Since 2021, Hong Kong courts have issued no fewer than six liquidation orders for Chinese property developers, including Evergrande, whose complex case involved substantial assets and numerous stakeholders.The execution of China South City's liquidation may encounter difficulties regarding mainland asset seizure.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Andrew Chan noted, ""There might not be many offshore assets to liquidate,"" explaining that the company's primary subsidiaries are based in mainland China.The firm's legal representative disclosed offshore debt totalling $1.3 billion, with principal bondholders controlling over 31% of this amount, according to the company's lawyer on Monday.China South City faced disagreements with creditors on multiple fronts. At a May hearing, creditors expressed their desire for increased involvement from the company's largest shareholder, Shenzhen SEZ Construction and Development Group Co., in debt negotiations.Shenzhen SEZ provides keepwell deeds for certain dollar bonds of the builder. These agreements ensure the issuer's solvency without explicitly guaranteeing payment, typically helping to reduce investor concerns about risk.Despite defaulting on dollar notes over a year ago, China South City's bonds were trading at approximately 25 cents as of Monday morning, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.This contrasts with Evergrande's bonds, which traded just above 1 cent before its January 2024 liquidation. China South City's bond prices exceed those of other defaulted developers, including Country Garden Holdings Co. and Sunac China Holdings Ltd., which has completed its second restructuring round.According to Zerlina Zeng, head of Asian strategy at Creditsights Singapore, the liquidation could be prolonged due to the company's substantial size. ""We expect poor recovery on its dollar bonds given limited additional financial support from the largest SOE stakeholder, Shenzhen SEZ Construction,"" she noted.The company shares a similar ownership structure with China Vanke Co., a significant Chinese developer that received state support in January from local authorities in Shenzhen.As of December 31, 2024, China South City reported total liabilities of approximately HK$60.9 billion, with cash and bank balances at HK$717.7 million.Citicorp International Ltd., the trustee of the developer's dollar bonds, initiated the winding-up petition against China South City. Citicorp also filed a separate legal action against Shenzhen SEZ last year.Trading of China South City's shares was suspended in Hong Kong on Monday.","Hong Kong High Court has issued a liquidation order for China South City Holdings Ltd. It is the largest Chinese construction company by assets to face winding up since China Evergrande Group. Despite governmental support measures, residential sales remain subdued.

Ford EV shift: Automaker to invest nearly $2 billion in Kentucky plant; plans affordable midsize electric pickup by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ford-ev-shift-automaker-to-invest-nearly-2-billion-in-kentucky-plant-plans-affordable-midsize-electric-pickup-by-2027/articleshow/123239673.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for electric vehicle (EV) production, aiming to build affordable and profitable models that can compete globally. The move marks a major transition for the facility, which has produced gas-powered vehicles for 70 years.“We took a radical approach to solve a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that are breakthrough in every way that matters — design, technology, performance, space and cost of ownership — and do it with American workers,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a release, reported AP.The announcement comes even as President Donald Trump’s administration rolls back EV purchase incentives, including plans to eliminate a federal credit worth up to $7,500. Farley, however, stressed that electric vehicles remain central to Ford’s future strategy.The first EV from the revamped Louisville plant will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck for domestic and international markets, set to launch in 2027. It will use lower-cost batteries manufactured at a Ford plant in Michigan, part of a previously announced $3 billion investment.Ford described the programme as a “Model T moment” for its EV division, referencing the mass-market vehicle that transformed the company’s history.The new platform will support multiple models, from sedans to SUVs, and combine electric and internal combustion variants.The Louisville plant will adopt an “assembly tree” system instead of a traditional single-line conveyor, cutting production costs and improving efficiency. Ford expects the new platform to reduce parts by 20%, cut fasteners by 25%, lower the number of workstations by 40% and shorten assembly time by 15%.“This is an example of us rejuvenating our US plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques,” Farley told the Associated Press. The midsize truck is expected to start at around $30,000, though specifications such as range, battery size and charge times will be announced later.The $2 billion investment will secure 2,200 hourly jobs in Louisville. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear called it “one of the largest investments on record in our state,” boosting Kentucky’s standing in EV innovation.Combined with the Michigan battery plant, Ford’s total $5 billion investment is projected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs and expand the domestic EV supply chain through dozens of new US-based suppliers.Ford’s EV unit, Model e, reported a $5.08 billion loss in 2024 with revenue down 35% to $3.9 billion. Farley emphasised that the goal is not to produce the most EVs, but to build a sustainable and profitable EV business that customers value.“This new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.","Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for electric vehicle (EV) production.

Trump yet to decide on China tariffs for Russia oil

China and India dominate Russian oil imports

India reacts sharply to 25% additional US tariff

Will US President Donald Trump impose additional tariffs on China for its procurement of crude oil from Russia? That’s a question that is being repeatedly asked of the US government since it announced a 25% additional tariff on India for its Russia crude oil trade.Donald Trump remains undecided about implementing tariffs on China regarding its Russian oil purchases, with Vice President J D Vance noting that Washington's relationship with Beijing included aspects beyond the Russian context.The United States had first implemented 25% reciprocal duties on India, and Trump recently imposed an additional 25% tariffs on Delhi for its Russian oil acquisitions. This has elevated the total tariffs on India to 50%, positioning it amongst the highest rates the US has enforced on any nation globally.The supplementary 25% tariff will be implemented from August 27.When questioned about tariffs on nations such as India for their Russian oil purchases and whether similar measures would apply to China, which also imports Russian oil, JD Vance emphasised the complex nature of US-China relations.""Well, the President said he's thinking about it, but he hasn't made any firm decisions,"" JD Vance said during his appearance on Fox News Sunday.The relationship with China presents greater complexity due to its wide-ranging implications beyond the Russian context, Vance explained.He indicated that Trump is currently evaluating various possibilities and will reach his conclusion at his own discretion.Also Read | Explainer: Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs - will India budge on Russia crude oil trade? ""Obviously the China issue is a little bit more complicated because our relationship with China, it affects a lot of other things that have nothing to do with the Russian situation,"" Vance said.India has criticised the US decision, describing it as ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"".""It is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India,"" said the external affairs ministry in Delhi, whilst confirming that India would undertake all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests.India ranks as the third-largest consumer of oil globally and has substantially increased its Russian crude oil imports following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, primarily due to the considerable price reductions available.Trump has called for India to cease buying discounted oil from Russia, asserting that these purchases are ""fueling the war machine"" in the Ukrainian conflict. His request is driven by two key aims: reducing the United States' trade imbalance with India and advancing negotiations with Russian President Putin to resolve the crisis in Ukraine.Also Read | Symbol of India-Russia ties takes a hard hit!

However, this dynamic shifted dramatically in 2022 after the Russia-Ukraine conflict began and G7 countries imposed a $60-per-barrel price cap, aiming to limit Russian oil revenue whilst ensuring continuous global supply.India continues to avoid sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela, but its Russian crude purchases remain permissible, leading to substantial increases in Russian imports. This resulted in reduced procurement from traditional sources such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Nigeria. According to Kpler's analysis, Russian oil, which held a negligible share in India's 2021 import mix, now accounts for about 37% of imports. This development has established India, alongside China, as a primary buyer of Russian crude.","Donald Trump remains undecided about implementing tariffs on China regarding its Russian oil purchases.

President Donald Trump on Monday called on China to increase its purchases of American soybeans, framing the move as a way to address Beijing’s trade deficit with the United States.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “China is worried about its shortage of soybeans. Our great farmers produce the most robust soybeans. I hope China will quickly quadruple its soybean orders. This is also a way of substantially reducing China’s Trade Deficit with the USA.

Tariffs at century-high average levels

A fresh look at US inflation trends this week is set to test Wall Street’s record run, with several strategists warning that equities may be primed for a pullback after months of near-uninterrupted gains.The benchmark S&P 500 closed on Friday up more than 8% for the year and near all-time highs, while the Nasdaq Composite set a new record, rebounding from early August losses triggered by weak US jobs data, according to Reuters report.The rally has lifted the S&P 500 by 28% from its April low, calming fears of a tariff-driven recession that had spiked after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement earlier this year.Strategists at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley have cautioned that the market’s steep climb has pushed valuations to historically expensive levels as the seasonally weak August–September period begins. “I do think the market is set up for a bit of a pullback. There’s a lot of concern bubbling underneath,” said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar Wealth.The July consumer price index (CPI), due Tuesday, is forecast to have risen 2.8% year-on-year, according to a Reuters poll.Analysts say stronger-than-expected inflation could temper expectations of imminent interest rate cuts, even as futures markets price in a 90% chance of a September Fed cut and at least two cuts this year.Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson warned that “a softer payroll number with concerns of tariff-related inflation could be the recipe for … a correction, especially in the seasonally weak third quarter,” though he maintained a bullish 12-month outlook, saying “we’re buyers of pullbacks.”Trump’s new import levies took effect on Thursday, raising the average US import duty to its highest in a century. Additional tariffs on semiconductor chips and pharmaceutical imports have been announced, while China could face higher duties on Tuesday unless a truce is extended.“The market has kind of ignored the potential negative impact of this friction to the economy,” said Matt Rowe, senior portfolio manager at Man Group. “The market has gotten comfortable with tariffs being kind of a non-event, which I don’t think is correct.”","S&P 500 closed on Friday up more than 8% for the year and near all-time highs.

US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has said he regrets that sandals he made with Adidas copied a traditional design from Oaxaca in southern Mexico.""I deeply regret that this design has appropriated the name and was not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,"" Chavarria told AFP.Chavarria further admitted the sandals failed to show the respect and cooperation owed to the community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, where the original design is believed to have originated. Chavarria is of Mexican heritage.Authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico, had complained that the “Oaxaca slip-on” sandals were a reworked version of the huarache, a style made only in that region, which has one of Mexico’s largest indigenous populations.On Friday, Mexico’s government said it would seek compensation from Adidas, after which Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum said Adidas had agreed to meet Oaxaca officials. She said the design was “collective intellectual property” and that the heritage law must be followed.The shoe features thin braided leather straps in a style tied to the cultural heritage of Zapotec Indigenous communities in Oaxaca, particularly in Villa Hidalgo de Yalalag.While traditional huaraches use flat leather soles, Adidas’ version incorporates a chunky sports shoe sole.The case is the latest in which Mexico has accused big fashion brands of using indigenous designs without permission. Similar disputes have involved Shein, Zara and Carolina Herrera. Handicrafts are a major source of jobs in Mexico, especially in Oaxaca, Jalisco, Michoacán and Guerrero.Last month in India, a public interest case was filed in the Bombay High Court against Italian brand Prada for showing sandals at Milan Fashion Week that looked similar to the traditional Kolhapuri chappal.","US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has said he regrets that sandals he made with Adidas copied a traditional design from Oaxaca in southern Mexico.

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer met privately with President Donald Trump this week to deliver a message she knew he might resist: his tariffs are hurting the state’s automotive industry, threatening jobs and profits in a sector central to Michigan’s economy.The Democrat brought a slide presentation to the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday, highlighting how Trump’s import taxes could cause severe economic damage in a state that helped elect him in 2024. It was Whitmer’s third White House meeting since Trump returned to office in January, but unlike her more public visit in April, this one was behind closed doors.According to people familiar with the talks, Whitmer also raised the need for federal support after an ice storm and asked to delay Medicaid changes, reported AP. Trump made no specific commitments.Under Trump’s trade measures, US automakers face a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, 30% on parts from China, and up to 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by a 2020 trade deal. Meanwhile, German, Japanese and South Korean vehicles pay only a 15% import tax under new agreements. Trump has also threatened a 100% tariff on imported computer chips, key to modern vehicle production, exempting only domestic producers.Whitmer’s presentation, obtained by The Associated Press, showed that trade with Canada and Mexico has driven $23.2 billion in investment to Michigan since 2020. General Motors, Ford and Stellantis run 50 factories in the state, supported by over 4,000 parts suppliers, together employing nearly 600,000 workers.Automakers have repeatedly warned the administration that the tariffs will cut profits and hurt global competitiveness. Ford said tariffs cost it $800 million in the second quarter alone, while GM reported $1.1 billion in related expenses. Both say these costs could limit investment in new US factories.Since Trump took office in January, Michigan has lost 7,500 manufacturing jobs, federal data show. Smaller suppliers, such as Detroit Axle, have also felt the strain. Owner Mike Musheinesh said the market has shifted from growth to mere survival, though his company recently avoided closing a warehouse and laying off over 100 workers.Matt Grossman, a political science professor at Michigan State University, said the meeting underscored Whitmer’s unique position among Democratic governors, balancing state interests with political opposition to Trump’s agenda. “Everyone’s aware Michigan is a critical swing state and the auto industry has outsized influence,” he said.","Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer met privately with President Donald Trump this week to deliver a message she knew he might resist.

Impact already being felt

Tariffs linked to Bolsonaro case

Flavour explosion

When US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50 per cent on Brazilian exports in July, acai producer Ailson Ferreira Moreira felt immediately concerned.After all, who was going to eat all of that Amazon berry, globally famous as a delicious, refreshing and nutritious superfood, if American consumers suddenly could no longer afford it?As the main importer of the Brazilian berry, prices of acai smoothies and bowls look certain to go up in the United States.""The acai that's all produced here ... If only people here eat it, it's going to be a lot of acai, right?"" Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's UN climate summit COP30 climate summit in November. ""If there's too much acai here, people won't be able to eat it all and the price will drop.""A single full crate of acai sells for around USD 50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. The US is by far the largest acai importer of a total Brazilian output currently estimated at about 70,000 tons per year.The most vulnerable acai producers in the northern state of Para say they have already been hit by tariffs imposed by the US government, as a surplus of the berry without a clear destination starts to mount only days after the new economic scenario unfolded.More powerful exporters, such as Sao Paulo-state based company Acai Tropicalia Mix, are also feeling the impact.One of its owners, Rogerio de Carvalho, told the AP that last year he exported to the US about 270 tonnes of acai cream - an industrialised version of the berry - ready for consumption. As tariffs started to loom, he said, American importers steered away and clients suspended negotiations. Until the end of July, de Carvalho estimates that his company sold 27 tonnes to the US.""That's 1.5 million Brazilian reais (USD 280,000) that we lost,"" the businessman said. ""We are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.""Trump has linked the higher tariffs on Brazil to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now under house arrest for his alleged role in leading an alleged coup plot to remain in office, despite his election loss to current leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.And despite several Brazilian exports being exempted from the tariffs, acai berries aren't among them.Brazil's industry ministry didn't reply to a request for comment on whether acai berries are among the items that remain on the negotiating table with US trade representatives.Nearly all of the acai consumed in the US originates from Brazil, with the state of Para alone accounting for 90 per cent of the country's total production. Several communities in the Amazon depend on its harvest.The harvesting of acai is a physically demanding job that requires workers to climb tall trees with minimal safety equipment, and then sliding down branches full of berries to fill baskets and then place them carefully in crates.Analysts say its producers also help protect the rainforest from illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers.The night markets of Belem, such as the Ver-o-Peso acai market, are a hub of activity where the freshly harvested berries are brought in by boat and prepared for sale.The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one tonne in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023. Another explosive rise was expected for this year, before the tariffs.On Thursday, Brazil requested consultations at the World Trade Organisation over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration against the South American nation that went into effect on Wednesday.That could be took little too late for acai harvester Mikael Silva Trindade, who agrees that the future of the trade is at risk as higher US tariffs can disrupt the delicate balance of supply and demand that holds the industry.""There will be nowhere to market (the excess of acai),"" Trindade told the AP as he picked berries in Para state. ""The more you export, the more valuable it becomes. But if there's too much to sell, it will stay here and become cheap.""","US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50 per cent on Brazilian exports in July.

It remains unclear how many licenses have been granted, which Chinese companies can receive the chips, or the total value of approved shipments.Nvidia previously disclosed a $5.5 billion hit from the export curbs but later revised the figure down by $1 billion after reusing some materials.The H20 alone generated $4.6 billion in first-quarter sales, with China accounting for 12.5% of the company’s overall revenue.The company has denied Chinese claims that the H20 poses national security risks, insisting the chip contains no “backdoors” for remote access.“Cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have ‘backdoors’ in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them,” a Nvidia spokesperson earlier said in a statement.CNBC reported that China’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) has asked Nvidia to “to clarify and submit relevant supporting documentation regarding security risks, including potential vulnerabilities and backdoors, associated with its H20 computing chips sold to China.”The regulator said Nvidia's AI chips have been reported to contain serious security flaws and noted that some US lawmakers are pushing for mandatory tracking features on advanced chip exports.Other high-end Nvidia AI chips remain barred from sale to China under longstanding US export controls aimed at slowing Beijing's AI and defense advancements.Huang has warned that Nvidia’s industry leadership could be at risk without access to the Chinese market, where domestic rivals like Huawei are rapidly expanding their chip offerings.","US Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses to Nvidia to export its H20 chips to China, a US official told Reuters.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Gold Price Outlook:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are expected to remain steady as global economic events continue to shape the yellow metal’s price outlook.Silver took centre stage last week, outshining most commodities by hitting an all-time high of ₹1,15,000 domestically and marking its highest COMEX level since 2012 near $40, before facing some profit booking. The rally was driven by strong industrial demand, supportive ETP flows, and a catch-up move relative to gold. Meanwhile, gold traded steady, supported by safe-haven flows after US President Trump threatened a 30% tariff on EU and Mexico imports from August 1.The EU responded by extending its suspension of countermeasures in hopes of a negotiated settlement. Tensions cooled somewhat as Trump later signalled openness to further talks. Market attention also turned to US inflation, which rose the most in five months in June, hinting that tariffs may be seeping into prices. Despite this, producer prices softened and industrial production showed modest recovery. Comments from Fed officials signaled a cautious stance, with expectations of rate cuts by year-end still intact.Brief uncertainty also rose as rumour rose that US President Donald Trump might initiate the process of firing Governor Powell, but quickly denied the same.Amid these developments, India's gold imports in June fell to a two-year low as high prices dented demand. It will be important to check how the negotiations between the US and other countries go, esp. China, EU, India, Russia and other major trading nations.This week’s key triggers include US durable goods orders, manufacturing and services PMIs, China’s loan prime rate decision, and Fed Chair Powell’s speech—all of which could provide clarity on the Fed’s next steps and impact precious metals momentum.Recovery in China is boosting the overall optimism in the market, however now it will be important to see along with economic numbers whether they loosen their policy further or leave it as it is. Lastly, it will be important to see whether Governor Powell’s speech shows President Trump’s recent threat or does he stay put on his “wait-and-watch” stance. Any sign of pressure could support bullion from lower levels.Stance: Sideways to Higher - Rs 96,000 to 99,500","Gold prices are expected to remain steady as global economic events continue to shape the yellow metal’s price outlook.

Russia sanctions: EU restrictions on Russian oil could hit India’s $15 billion fuel exports; 'will have to walk a fine line…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/russia-sanctions-eu-restrictions-on-russian-oil-could-hit-indias-15-billion-fuel-exports-will-have-to-walk-a-fine-line/articleshow/122798101.cms,"The European Union's latest sanctions will adversely affect countries including India, Turkey, and the UAE.

‘Don’t Apply Double Standards’: India Rips Into NATO For Issuing Sanction Threat Over Russian Oil

How India’s $15 billion Oil Exports Will Be Hit

The European Union's latest sanctions will adversely affect countries including India, Turkey, and the UAE, which process Russian crude oil to produce and export diesel, petrol, and jet fuel to European markets.

""India's $5 billion exports of petroleum products to the EU are at risk. The EU's new sanctions ban imports of refined petroleum made from Russian crude via third countries like India,"" GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava said according to a PTI report.

GTRI's assessment indicates that the new restrictions affect refined petroleum products from third countries using Russian crude, with exemptions granted to only a handful of nations including the US, UK, Canada, and Switzerland.

The think tank reports that whilst India's petroleum product exports to the EU stood at $19.2 billion in FY24, then declined significantly by 27.1% to $15 billion in 2024-25.

India's crude oil imports from Russia were around $50.3 billion in FY2025. This is more than one-third of India’s total crude expenditure of $143.1 billion.

Advantage India & Less Cause For Worry

Russian oil sanctions by the European Union could dent India’s $15 billion fuel exports, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has warned.The EU's 27 member states have introduced their 18th sanctions package against Russia, primarily targeting the oil and energy sector revenues. From an Indian standpoint, the biggest takeaway is that these new sanctions also apply to imports of petroleum products refined from Russian crude oil in any third nation.India imports crude oil from Russia in a big way and then exports it globally.""Although India continues to engage in legitimate trade with Russia, the political optics of such transactions are shifting in Western capitals. As energy ties deepen, India will have to walk a fine line between economic pragmatism and geopolitical pressure,"" Srivastava said.Nayara Energy and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) are expected to encounter challenges due to the European Union's latest sanctions against Russian oil.The EU has lowered the Russian oil price cap from $60 to $47.6 per barrel and introduced restrictions on vessels transporting Russian oil. These measures will become effective September 3.According to an ET report, whilst Nayara Energy faces direct operational constraints from EU's targeted sanctions, RIL must navigate complications arising from restrictions on fuel products derived from Russian oil.Industry specialists and analysts suggest that both companies risk being shut out of European markets. These sanctions also complicate Rosneft's reported plans to divest its 49% stake in Nayara. As India's principal fuel exporters, both RIL and Nayara stand significantly affected by these developments.Also Read | Russia oil squeeze: Trump’s 100% tariff threat - should India panic? The new oil price limit will force Russia to sell its crude at reduced rates to countries including India. As Russia's second-biggest oil customer, India stands to benefit from this situation. Russian oil currently makes up about 40% of India's total oil imports.Whilst India could see advantages from lower prices, there are concerns about future imports due to potential American sanctions. US President Donald Trump has warned that nations buying Russian exports could face penalties or heavy tariffs if Russia does not achieve peace with Ukraine within 50 days.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has rejected concerns about possible consequences for India if Russian oil access becomes restricted through additional tariffs. ""I'm not worried at all. If something happens, we'll deal with it,"" Puri has said.""India has diversified the sources of supply and we have gone, I think, from about 27 countries that we used to buy from to about 40 countries now,"" he said.Also Read | Russia oil sanctions: EU moves on crude, oil price cap may hit Reliance, Nayara; enforcing may be difficult, India may still benefit","The European Union's latest sanctions will adversely affect countries including India, Turkey, and the UAE.

India's share in US imports inches up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-share-in-us-imports-inches-up/articleshow/122824943.cms,"Representational Image

NEW DELHI: India has seen a slight increase in the share of US imports with Switzerland, EU and Taiwan being the top gainers, while China, Mexico and Canada are among the biggest losers.According to US Census Bureau data, in 2025, up to May, India's share rose to 3.1%, from 2.9% in the previous year. During this period, Switzerland saw a 3.3 percentage point increase, while China witnessed a 2.7 percentage point dip (see graphic).In most product segments, China that has been the main focus of Trump's actions has lost market share, with India gaining in some segments, notably electronics and textiles.The US Census Bureau data showed that China's dominance in advanced technology products has been significantly eroded with its share crashing to 5.8% in the calendar year up to May 2025, compared with 14.5% in the corresponding period in 2024 - implying an 8.7 percentage point decline. During this period, Taiwan's share jumped from 9.2% to 15.8%, Mexico being the other major gainer with a 2.3 percentage point rise to 14.7%.India saw its share rise from 2.3% of US advanced technology product imports to 3.5% in 2025.Officials said that in the electronics segment, China's share of US imports halved to 11% between June 2024 and May 2025, while India's jumped from 3.5% to 7.2%, driven by mobile phones and solar cells. Mexico and Vietnam were the other beneficiaries.Similarly, in textiles, China's share declined from 27% in June 2024 to 14% last May, while India gained from 9% to 12% during this period. Vietnam saw some trade moving to its factories and grabbed 18% share in May 2025, from 14% in June 2024.""India's apparel exports data to the US underscores the highly price-sensitive nature of the American market. Even marginal price increases prompt sourcing shifts, reflecting the intense competition in the market. In this context, tariff reduction under the India-US trade agreement becomes critical, as it will significantly improve India's price competitiveness and enable deeper market penetration across key apparel segments and help us build on the impressive growth of 13% registered during 2024-25, said Mithileshwar Thakur, secretary general of Apparel Export Promotion Council.While there is a marginal gain in farm goods, India's share of gems and jewellery and chemicals imported into the US fell. Govt officials admitted that the 25% additional tariff in automobiles and components had hurt Indian exporters with tractors, motorcycles and mopeds seeing lower demand.""So far the stocks with stores in the US have helped them meet the demand but everyone is waiting for clarity on tariffs. Orders will be based on tariff advantage that a country enjoys. We are hoping that India and the US can agree on a package and we can get a good deal as demand from American consumers remains strong,"" said Colin Shah, managing director of Kama Jewelry, a large exporter.","In 2025, up to May, India's share rose to 3.1%, from 2.9% in the previous year.

BENGALURU: CoinDCX confirmed a $44 million security breach involving one of its internal operational accounts, marking the second-largest publicly known crypto hack at an Indian exchange. The company launched a recovery bounty of up to $11 million to trace the funds and identify those responsible.While the loss was limited to CoinDCX’s own treasury and customer assets remained unaffected, the incident reignited scrutiny over operational security across Indian crypto platforms. “No customer funds were affected, and we absorbed the loss through our own treasury,” CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta said.This is the second major crypto security incident involving an Indian exchange, following WazirX’s 2022 disclosure of a $230 million exploit. Previous breaches at platforms such as BuyUcoin also raised concerns around security architecture and incident preparedness.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel, headed by BJP leader Baijayant Panda, has favoured continuing tax exemption on anonymous donations made to religious-cum-charitable trusts in the new Income Tax Bill, saying any removal would have an adverse impact on not-for-profit groups.The 31-member select committee of the Lok Sabha that examined the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, also suggested allowing taxpayers to claim TDS refund even after the ITR filing due date without paying any penal charges. The committee has recommended changes in the Income Tax Bill, 2025, which will replace the six-decade-old Income Tax Act, 1961.The 4,575 page report, which was tabled in the Lok Sabha on Monday, also made suggestions for sweeping changes in the way the new Income Tax Bill, 2025, was to treat income of non-profit organisations (NPOs), while commending tax department’s move of replacing the dual concepts of “previous year” and “assessment year” with a single, unified term: “tax year.” “The adoption of a single, consistent ‘tax year’ streamlines tax period references throughout the legislation, making the law more accessible and easier to understand,” the report said.With regard to NPOs, the government in the new bill has exempted from tax anonymous donations received by purely religious trusts. However, such donations received by a religious trust that may also have other charitable functions, like running hospitals, and educational institutions, will be taxed as per law.","A parliamentary panel has favoured continuing tax exemption on anonymous donations made to religious-cum-charitable trusts.

Allies under pressure as US sticks to its terms

Russia tariffs tied to political goals

China discussions may restart, focus on overcapacity and oil

The US will not fast-track trade deals simply to meet deadlines, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said, signalling that the Trump administration remains focused on securing high-quality agreements even as a key tariff deadline approaches.In an interview with CNBC, Bessent stated, “The Trump administration is more concerned with the quality of trade agreements rather than their timing. We're not going to rush for the sake of doing deals.” The remarks come ahead of the August 1 deadline, when tariffs on several US trade partners could kick in if talks fail to yield progress, according to an ET report.While describing the ongoing negotiations as “moving along,” Bessent warned that failure to reach agreements could escalate trade tensions. “If we boomerang on August 1 tariffs, higher tariffs could put more pressure on countries,” he said.Bessent pointed to growing engagement from the European Union, noting, “They’ve become more engaged,” and said he expects Brussels may aim to speed up negotiations. “I imagine they would want to negotiate faster,” he added.On Japan, Bessent clarified that Washington’s focus remains firmly on securing the best outcomes for the US, not adapting to domestic political calendars in partner countries.“Our priorities are not internal government but best deals for U.S.,” he said.Despite the approaching deadline, Bessent expressed confidence in the ongoing discussions. “Trade is in a good place,” he said.Touching on Russia, Bessent acknowledged that tariff measures can go beyond trade. “Tariffs can be a means to political ends,” he said, referring to current conversations around sanctions.He also hinted at a possible joint strategy with allies, saying, “Would urge Europe to follow us if we implement secondary tariffs,” without naming affected sectors or timelines.On China, Bessent said talks could resume “in the near future,” but flagged overcapacity as the primary concern. “The elephant in the room with China is overcapacity,” he said, mentioning steel and solar as key pressure points.He also pointed to two new areas of concern that may enter future negotiations—Beijing’s trade ties with Russia and its stance on Iranian oil. “Could start talking about Iranian oil,” Bessent said, while adding that the US “could discuss [China’s] trade with Russia” as part of broader diplomatic talks.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the US will not fast-track trade deals simply to meet deadlines.

"Forget Nvidia’s $4 trillion valuation! This tech company is set to cross $4.5 trillion market cap, thanks to its big AI bets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/forget-nvidias-4-trillion-valuation-this-tech-company-is-set-to-cross-4-5-trillion-market-cap-thanks-to-its-big-ai-bets/articleshow/122818873.cms,"Nvidia has become the first company to cross the $4 trillion. But, there’s another technology company that may hit $4.5 trillion! (AI image)

Nvidia’s Rise: Is The Market Dominance Sustainable?

Which Company can Hit $4.5 Trillion Market Cap?

Oppenheimer's optimistic outlook comes from many factors:

There is expectation of higher revenue growth from Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.

Azure has actually emerged as Microsoft's main growth driver. This is due to increasing computational requirements for AI development.

Additionally, Microsoft's investment in OpenAI not only implies a significant Azure customer but also provides essential resources for the broader AI development community.

Nvidia has seen a meteoric rise - becoming the first company in the world to have a market capitalization of over $4 trillion. In fact there are only five economies in the world that have a GDP of over $4 trillion as per IMF’s 2025 projections. But even though Nvidia has become the first company to cross the $4 trillion capitalization mark, there’s another technology company that may hit $4.5 trillion!According to Oppenheimer analysts quoted in a Motley Fool report, another AI giant is poised to join Nvidia in the $4 trillion valuation category and potentially reach $4.5 trillion within the next year. Currently, this particular stock presents a more favourable investment opportunity compared to Nvidia, the Oppenheimer analysts believeNvidia stands out as a big success story - its valuation has seen an over 10 times rise in the last three years. This remarkable growth stems from substantial investments in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, where Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) serve as essential components.However, Nvidia's leading position in the AI chip sector encounters challenges.Other GPU manufacturers are improving their price-performance ratios, whilst Nvidia's major hyperscale clients are increasingly utilising their own custom silicon designs for generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.This could possibly impact the company’s growth outlook.Nvidia is an AI chip industry leader, particularly in training hardware. Its superiority comes from advanced tech capabilities and its exclusive CUDA software platform. This creates big barriers for competitors to surmount in the semiconductor market, the Motley Fool report says.However, major clients such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft are actively seeking to reduce their dependence on Nvidia's AI training hardware, the report said.Meta is expanding its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator system across various generative AI applications. Their new chip aims to replace Nvidia processors in AI training for the Llama foundation model, whilst they already utilise their custom chips for certain AI inference operations.Microsoft harbors similar objectives with its Maia chips, although they have delayed their next-generation AI training chip launch to 2026, rather than releasing it this year.Such delays have previously affected other large-scale computing companies, including Meta, resulting in substantial Nvidia orders.Nevertheless, as these technology giants enhance their chip design capabilities, they could potentially reduce their reliance on Nvidia's processors substantially over time.Nvidia maintains a strong market position, particularly following the US government's decision to lift restrictions on H20 chip sales in China. The company is poised to see a robust earnings growth throughout the year, driven by Chinese market access and hyperscaler demand.However, what is noteworthy is that Nvidia’s shares command a significant premium, trading at nearly 40 times projected earnings, the report noted. Given this elevated valuation and potential long-term challenges, the stock's growth rate might lag behind other major artificial intelligence enterprises.Currently, only a select few organisations rival Nvidia's market presence. Among the exclusive group of companies valued above $1 trillion, merely three have achieved valuations exceeding $3 trillion, with Nvidia being one of them.Microsoft, valued at approximately $3.8 trillion presently, stands closest to Nvidia. Oppenheimer analysts project Microsoft could reach the $4 trillion milestone shortly. Their analysis sets a $600 price target for Microsoft shares, suggesting a potential market valuation of $4.5 trillion, representing a 19% increase from its value as of July 15.The surge in demand has been remarkable. Despite Microsoft's substantial investment of $80 billion in capital expenditures, primarily directed towards data centre construction and equipment, the company reports that demand still exceeds supply. Nevertheless, Azure maintains its position as the fastest-growing platform amongst the three major public cloud services.Analysts' optimistic outlook on Microsoft stems largely from the prospects of Copilot Studio. Whilst they acknowledge modest interest in Microsoft 365's native AI assistant Copilot, they anticipate stronger performance from the customisable AI assistant platform, Copilot Studio. This development allows Microsoft to implement higher pricing for its enterprise software package whilst maintaining customer loyalty. The higher revenue can in turn be reinvested in Azure and share buyback programmes. This would potentially boost earnings per share via improved profits distributed across a lower share count.Microsoft shares currently trade at approximately 33 times forward earnings, reflecting a relatively high valuation. However, this multiple appears justified for a company that maintains leadership positions in both cloud computing and enterprise software sectors of the AI industry.Following news about potential reversal of US restrictions on chip exports to China, Oppenheimer analysts revised their Nvidia price target to $200 per share, suggesting a market capitalisation of $4.9 trillion. However, at current prices, Microsoft presents a more appealing investment opportunity, the report said.","N Nvidia has seen a meteoric rise - becoming the first company in the world to have a market capitalization of over $4 trillion.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 52 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4% to a new all-time high, AP reported.Telecom giant Verizon Communications led the gains with a 3% jump after posting quarterly earnings and revenue ahead of analysts’ expectations. The company also raised its full-year profit and financial forecasts.That helped balance a 0.4% decline in Microsoft shares, which slipped after the company issued an emergency software patch to fix a critical SharePoint vulnerability that had been actively exploited by hackers, including against some federal agencies.Block Inc, formerly Square and founded by Jack Dorsey, surged 6.7% after being announced as the newest entrant to the S&P 500 index. It will replace Hess Corp, which was acquired by Chevron, and begin trading in the index on Wednesday.Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs rallied 6.8% after reporting a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss. The company shipped a record 4.3 million net tons of steel in the spring quarter. CEO Lourenco Goncalves credited Trump-era tariffs for boosting domestic manufacturing, calling them a ""positive impact"" on the business. Cleveland-Cliffs is a major supplier to the auto sector, which benefits from domestic sourcing policies.However, the broader market remains cautious. While tariffs may aid certain sectors, they are also pushing up import costs. Companies like General Motors, which reports results later this week, are grappling with the downside. Other key earnings due include Alphabet, Coca-Cola, and Tesla.Many of Trump’s proposed tariffs remain on hold, with the next major deadline set for August 1 as negotiations with trading partners continue.Despite the mixed backdrop, early signs from the earnings season suggest resilience. Most companies have been beating Wall Street estimates, with Bank of America’s Savita Subramanian noting potential “encouraging undertones” from strong retail sales and rising travel demand, as reported by United Airlines.In the bond market, yields dipped. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.38% from 4.44% on Friday.Global cues were mixed. European indices edged lower after modest gains in Asian markets. Japan’s markets were shut for a public holiday, following a political upset in Sunday’s upper house elections.Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its coalition majority in both houses of parliament for the first time since 1955. Ishiba, facing voter anger over inflation and instability, pledged to remain in office. Analysts expect his government to ramp up spending, adding to Japan’s already high debt levels.","The S&P 500 rose 0.3% in early trade, hovering just above the record it set last Thursday.

AI diplomacy: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s Beijing visit draws fan frenzy; chipmaker reopens H20 sales in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-diplomacy-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-beijing-visit-draws-fan-frenzy-chipmaker-reopens-h20-sales-in-china/articleshow/122815738.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s recent visit to Beijing has sparked a wave of public enthusiasm, with videos on Chinese social media showing the billionaire executive signing autographs, posing for selfies, and mingling with fans on the streets—an unusual sight for a global tech CEO. This marked Huang’s third visit to China in 2025 and coincided with the reopening of H20 chip sales in the country following a US-imposed ban in April.The head of the world’s most valuable company arrived in China last week to attend the China International Supply Chain Expo, just days after meeting US President Donald Trump. Huang's presence in Beijing came amid growing geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions between Washington and Beijing, with Nvidia’s $17 billion China business caught in the middle of an intensifying technology rivalry, Reuters reported.""Jensen Huang's visit aimed to demonstrate Nvidia's commitment to the Chinese market,"" said Lian Jye Su, chief analyst at Omdia. ""However, this commitment must be balanced against potential US government concerns about deepening ties with China.""In Beijing, Huang praised Chinese AI models developed by DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Tencent as “world class”, and said demand for Nvidia’s H20 chips had surged since the launch of DeepSeek models in January.He also held meetings with senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier and trade tsar He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, which he described as “wonderful”.""Nvidia will still need to see the tide clearly and ride it at the right time to maximize the available benefits. But good for the company, I think it has a CEO who's very good at doing that,"" said Tilly Zhang, a technology analyst with Gavekal Dragonomics, quoted Reuters.Despite the warm reception, some analysts say Nvidia’s dominance in China could face long-term challenges. ""The Chinese government will actively help or subsidize domestic rivals that can one day stand up to and, at least in some use cases, replace high-end Nvidia chips,"" said Charlie Chai, an analyst with 86Research.When asked how US officials reacted to his China trip, Huang told reporters, “I told President Trump and his cabinet that I was coming to China. Told him about my trip here, and he said, 'Have a great trip'.""At the Expo, Huang wore a traditional black Chinese-style jacket instead of his trademark leather one and referred to himself as ""Chinese"" during his speech. He lauded the scale of China’s supply chain as “vast” and praised even strategic rival Huawei Technologies.""I think the fact of the matter is, anyone who discounts Huawei and anyone who discounts China's manufacturing capability is deeply naive.

Let these actions serve as a warning to any country who thinks it can take advantage of the US, our carriers, and our market. America First means fighting for the fundamental principle of fairness,"" he added.Duffy indicated that Mexico's policy of redirecting airlines from Benito Juarez International Airport to Felipe Angeles International Airport, situated over 30 miles (48.28 kilometres) away, breached international agreements and unfairly benefited their domestic carriers.He said the move gives Mexican carriers an unfair edge over US airlines.In response, the US will now require all Mexican passenger, cargo, and charter airlines to submit their flight schedules for government approval until the issue is resolved.Mexico remains the preferred international destination for American travellers, with passenger numbers exceeding 40 million in the previous year.Mexican airlines across passenger, cargo and charter services must now obtain Transportation Department approval and submit their flight schedules until the Secretary deems Mexico's treatment of US airlines satisfactory.The impact of these restrictions on ongoing trade disputes and tariff discussions with Mexico remains uncertain.Delta and Aeromexico have contested the Transportation Department's attempts to terminate their partnership, which began in 2016.In an earlier filing, the two carriers also argued that ending the agreement could lead to over 140,000 Americans and nearly 90,000 Mexicans canceling travel plans, significantly impacting tourism-related spending and harming both economies.""The US Department of Transportation's tentative proposal to terminate its approval of the strategic and pro-competitive partnership between Delta and Aeromexico would cause significant harm to consumers traveling between the US and Mexico, as well as US jobs, communities, and transborder competition,"" Delta said in a statement.The airlines argue it’s unfair to penalise them for decisions made by the Mexican government.They also warned that ending the alliance could put nearly two dozen flight routes at risk and impact $800 million in economic benefits tied to tourism and employment in both countries.Aeromexico’s press office said it is reviewing the order and plans to issue a joint response with Delta in the coming days.However, the termination of the partnership approval won’t take effect until October, giving the airlines time to continue challenging the decision.","The US will now require all Mexican passenger, cargo, and charter airlines to submit their flight schedules for government approval until the issue is resolved.

The company, which generated $43 billion in revenue during the first quarter, has now exceeded Meta's quarterly earnings, Reuters reported quoting sources.The US consortium backed by the administration in the TikTok deal includes private equity firm KKR and new investors like Andreessen Horowitz, with Oracle also expected to take a stake. However, it remains unclear whether all original consortium members are still part of the bid.Earlier this year, the group was working on a plan to spin off TikTok’s US operations into a separate American company. But negotiations stalled after China signaled it would block the deal, shortly after Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports.If a deal goes through, TikTok's US operations are expected to be run by a new joint venture between an American investor group and ByteDance, which would retain a minority stake.Blackstone’s decision to withdraw underscores the growing uncertainty and complications surrounding the deal. The future of TikTok has become entangled in broader US-China trade tensions, with Trump indicating he would discuss the issue directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.TikTok is already developing a separate version of the app for the US market.","Private equity firm's exit comes amid growing uncertainty and multiple delays in the TikTok transaction.

Explained: What are EU’s fresh sanctions on Russia? Here’s what they mean,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-what-are-eus-fresh-sanctions-on-russia-heres-what-they-mean/articleshow/122783561.cms,"1. Russian oil: A fresh price cap

Currently, that would put the cap at around $47.60 per barrel, a significant drop from the $60 limit introduced by the G7 in December 2022.

This lower threshold is designed to curb Russia’s energy income while avoiding a shock to global oil supplies.

Russia Claims Hitting US-Supplied Patriot Systems In Ukraine; Moscow Hits Kyiv With Drones, Missiles

This rule excludes imports from Norway, Britain, the US, Canada, and Switzerland.

The EU is ending the Czech Republic’s exemption from the bloc-wide seaborne Russian oil ban, after the country shifted entirely to alternative suppliers.

The EU sanctions package also targets India’s Nayara oil refinery, in which Russia’s largest oil producer, Rosneft, holds a major share.

3. Targeting the 'Shadow Fleet'

105 additional ships have been banned from EU ports and waters.

These include vessels engaging in ship-to-ship transfers, a common method used to mask the origin of Russian oil.

The total number of sanctioned ships now exceeds 400, according to Reuters.

4. Nord Stream: Total cut-off

5. Financial sector: A blanket ban

The ban also targeted Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).

EU countries agreed to lower the threshold for penalising foreign financial entities found to be helping Russia evade sanctions or fund the war effort.

6. Export restrictions and new blacklist entries

The bloc will bar exports of certain chemicals, plastics and machinery to Russia.

26 new entities have been added to the sanctions list for circumventing restrictions, including, 7 in China, 3 in Hong Kong, 4 in Turkey.

7. Delays and diplomatic hurdles

Slovakia objected due to concerns about an upcoming EU plan to ban Russian gas imports by 2028.

It lifted its veto earlier this week after receiving guarantees from the EU to mitigate potential losses.

How did India react?

The European Union unveiled its 18th package of sanctions against Russia, aiming to further squeeze Moscow’s oil revenues and financial networks over its ongoing war in Ukraine. Approved on Friday, the new measures include a series of toughened restrictions focused largely on the energy sector, shipping, and financial dealings.Here’s a what the latest sanctions include:At the heart of this package is a new price cap on Russian oil. The EU plans to impose a moving price ceiling, pegged at 15% below the average market price of Russian crude.The measure takes effect from 3 September, with a 90-day transition period for existing contracts. Under the new rules, any crude purchased above the cap cannot be shipped, insured or reinsured by EU firms, as per a Reuters report.The European Union and Britain had been urging the G7 to reduce the existing $60 price cap on Russian oil, arguing that falling oil futures had rendered it ineffective. However, opposition from the United States stalled any collective action, prompting the EU to act independently.Still, the bloc faces limits in enforcing the measure, as oil is predominantly traded in US dollars and payment clearing is largely controlled by American banks.After a six-month grace period, the EU will no longer import petroleum products made from Russian oil, even if they’re refined elsewhere.In an effort to disrupt Russia’s workaround using ageing tankers:The EU also blacklisted a private operator of an international flag registry and an entity involved in Russia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, though it did not disclose their names.The EU will ban all transactions linked to the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which run under the Baltic Sea. This includes the provision of goods and services to the infrastructure.In a major escalation, the EU will now prohibit all transactions with Russian financial institutions, many of which are already cut off from SWIFT.The approval of this package wasn’t smooth. Slovakia and Malta initially delayed the rollout:The ministry of external affairs on Friday hit out at the European Union’s “unilateral” sanctions on Russia, criticising the bloc’s “double standards” in energy trade.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement in post on X, ""We have noted the latest sanctions announced by the European Union. India does not subscribe to any unilateral sanction measures. We are a responsible actor and remain fully committed to our legal obligations.""The MEA further emphasised that ensuring energy security is a top priority for the Indian government to meet the essential needs of its citizens. “We would stress that there should be no double standards, especially when it comes to energy trade,” the statement added.The EU’s latest sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine war include measures targeting an Indian refinery partly owned by Rosneft. The Russian energy giant holds a 49.13% stake in Nayara Energy Ltd, formerly Essar Oil. Nayara operates a major refinery in Vadinar, Gujarat, with an annual capacity of 20 million tonnes, and runs over 6,750 fuel stations across India.","The European Union unveiled its 18th package of sanctions against Russia.

Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ a blow to Indian students in US? $170 billion funds allocated for ICE; 1% remittance tax adds to burden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill-a-blow-to-indian-students-in-us-170-billion-funds-allocated-for-ice-1-remittance-tax-adds-to-burden/articleshow/122782592.cms,"AI-generated image

The recently enacted Donald Trump's ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is potentially turning out to another blow to Indian students in the United States by allocating approximately $170 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for expanding deportation operations.This legislation strengthens enforcement agencies' authority to monitor local communities and track visa violations, according to study abroad platform executives. Students on Optional Practical Training (OPT) face heightened risks, as even minimal delays in securing employment or exceeding visa duration could result in severe penalties.Additionally, the legislation's new 1% remittance tax is anticipated to impact students who transfer funds to their home country for family support or loan repayments. ""Even a small tax can affect low-income students — every dollar counts when supporting tuition or families back home,"" said Adarsh Khandelwal, cofounder of Collegify, quoted by Economic Times. This taxation applies to international transfers by F-1 student visa holders, H-1B workers, and green card holders using traditional payment methods. A $10 tax would apply to a $1,000 transfer to India.Students paying full fees without scholarships will not be subject to this tax, which becomes effective after January 1, 2026.Education consultants view this tax as a minor inconvenience rather than a significant barrier. ""A 1% rate is annoying, not prohibitive,"" said Nikhil Jain, founder of ForeignAdmits, as quoted by ET. ""Students are resourceful; they'll adapt by consolidating transfers, exploring digital wallets, or simply factoring it into their budget,"" he added.The tax represents an additional concern for Indian students in the US. Since January, increased scrutiny of non-immigrant visa holders and deportation of unauthorised residents has heightened anxiety. Recent intensification of visa procedures and social media monitoring has caused unease. ""Students are becoming hypervigilant about everything – their social media presence, their financial transactions, their visa status,"" Jain of ForeignAdmits said. ""This tax is just adding to the paranoia.""Experts report that students and visa applicants are removing previous social media content and exercising increased caution regarding their online activities.The legislation also reduces federal support, including Medicaid and SNAP benefits for state colleges, which previously assisted numerous students.This reduction might increase institutions' reliance on international students paying full fees, who are exempt from the new remittance tax.Nevertheless, only a small proportion of Indian students attend prestigious US universities at full cost, with most relying on financial assistance or attending mid-tier institutions.Education experts suggest that prospective Indian students might now consider alternative study destinations.",Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' is potentially turning out to another blow to Indian students in the United States.

Crypto surges: Cryptocurrency mcap reaches record high at $4 trillion; What's driving the rally?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/crypto-surges-cryptocurrency-mcap-reaches-record-high-at-4-trillion-whats-driving-the-rally/articleshow/122777039.cms,"The global cryptocurrency market capitalisation touched a record $4 trillion on Friday, positioning the sector as a major investment option from a fringe class, as per the Coingecko data, cited by Reuters.This fresh milestone comes amid renewed investor optimism, increased institutional inflows, and clearer regulatory signals from major economies.Notably, the US House of Representatives on Thursday passed a landmark bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar, sending it to President Donald Trump, who signed it into law.""The arrival of the Trump legislation signaled an about-turn in attitudes towards the crypto industry, but legislators are still exercising some caution,"" Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown told Reuters.In addition to the stablecoin bill, the House also approved two more crypto-related proposals. One seeks to introduce a comprehensive regulatory regime for digital assets, while the other aims to prohibit the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the US Both bills are now headed to the Senate for further debate.The $4 trillion figure highlights how far the crypto sector has come since its early days as a speculative, niche market.Today, digital assets are attracting growing interest from asset managers, corporate treasuries, and everyday investors. The launch of new exchange-traded products and increasing adoption by both retail and institutional players is placing cryptocurrencies at the heart of mainstream financial conversations.Stablecoins, designed to maintain a fixed value, typically tied 1:1 to the US dollar, have become a cornerstone of crypto trading, enabling users to seamlessly move funds across tokens. Their rapid growth has fuelled calls for structured oversight, with advocates suggesting they could revolutionise instant payment systems.“The Genius Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class,” said Chris Perkins, president of crypto investment firm CoinFund.Institutional enthusiasm continues to build, with a rising number of public companies allocating bitcoin to their treasuries as a long-term store of value.Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, recently crossed the $120,000 mark, its highest level ever, before retreating 1.8% on Friday to help bring the sector’s valuation slightly down to $3.92 trillion.Analysts at brokerage Bernstein have forecast bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025.Meanwhile, ether, the second-largest crypto token, climbed 4.5% and has more than doubled in value over the past three months.The ongoing rally has also lifted crypto-linked equities, as per a Reuters report.Shares of Coinbase and Robinhood, both of which facilitate cryptocurrency trading, hit all-time highs on Friday. Coinbase was last up 1%, while Robinhood rose 3%. Ether-centric stocks likewise posted broad-based gains, riding the wave of digital market enthusiasm.","The global cryptocurrency market capitalisation touched a record $4 trillion on Friday.

Political stance





US President Donald Trump on Friday signed the ""GENIUS Act,"" a new law aimed at regulating payment stablecoins, marking a significant step toward bringing legitimacy and oversight to the cryptocurrency industry.The law, officially titled ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins,"" represents a major policy shift for digital assets in the US. The new law received strong support in both the House and Senate, passing with wide bipartisan backing.Speaking at a White House signing ceremony attended by around 200 people, including prominent crypto executives and top Republican lawmakers, Trump called the law a “massive validation” of the industry’s efforts.“For years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,” he told the attendees.“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,"" the US president added.Later, taking to Truth Social, he wrote ""I pledged that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the US the crypto capital of the world—The Genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins…""The “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins"" or GENIUS Act is a set of regulatory frameworks aimed at establishing oversight and consumer protections for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies tied to traditional assets like the US dollar to reduce price volatility.It lays down foundational rules for stablecoin issuers, aimed at improving consumer confidence in a segment of crypto that has seen explosive growth, as per AP.The new law is a big step for an industry that has quickly gained political influence in Washington, thanks to heavy lobbying and campaign donations.A notable provision in the new law prohibits members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, a move intended to address concerns over conflicts of interest, according to AP.However, the ban does not apply to the president or his family. Trump's family is known to hold a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin earlier this year, backed in part by an investment fund from the United Arab Emirates.The House also advanced two additional crypto-related bills on Thursday.

Bottom line



July 2025. A packed Coldplay concert. Sixty thousand people swaying to Fix You. And then—on the stadium's Kiss Cam—two familiar-looking executives: Andy Byron , CEO of Astronomer, and Kristin Cabot, his Chief People Officer. They don’t kiss. But they don’t exactly recoil either.Within hours, the clip had gone viral. Was it an affair? A PR disaster? An HR crisis? But the more mundane—and surprisingly popular—question on Google was:What is Astronomer, and why is its CEO at a Coldplay concert with HR?Here’s the answer.Despite its celestial name, Astronomer is not a space company. It’s a tech firm that operates in the world of data orchestration. In other words, it builds the infrastructure that lets large companies move and manage their data in real time—so apps can give you accurate updates, AI models can make smart predictions, and dashboards can tell you what’s going wrong.Astronomer’s key product is a cloud-based service called Astro, which simplifies a popular open-source tool named Apache Airflow.Apache Airflow is an open-source system originally built at Airbnb. Think of it as a conductor for all the tasks in a company’s data pipeline. For example, if a firm wants to:Airflow makes sure each step runs in the right order, handles failures, retries automatically, and logs everything.It’s widely used across tech, finance, healthcare, and retail.Astronomer didn’t invent Airflow—but it has become the leading commercial company that packages, manages, and scales it for enterprises.Airflow is free, but running it reliably across a large company is not. That’s where Astronomer’s platform Astro comes in. It offers:Companies like Apple, Stripe, Bloomberg and dozens of Fortune 500 firms now use Astronomer to manage their data pipelines.Modern businesses run on data. Whether it’s Netflix recommending your next show, a bank flagging fraud, or a health app warning about irregular heart rhythms—data needs to flow, cleanly and reliably.Astronomer ensures that happens. Without tools like Astro, companies would have to spend millions building in-house systems to handle the same problems. And without clean, well-managed data, AI models produce garbage, apps break, and decision-making falters.Is Astronomer a space tech company?No. It works with data, not planets. The name is metaphorical—think mapping vast digital universes.What is data orchestration?The process of scheduling, coordinating, and automating how data flows between systems—like ETL, but more intelligent and flexible.What is Astro?Astro is Astronomer’s cloud platform that runs and manages Apache Airflow for enterprises.What kind of companies use Astronomer?Tech firms, banks, retailers, media companies, and more—anyone with complex data pipelines.Why was Astronomer in the news?Its CEO Andy Byron and HR head Kristin Cabot were seen on the Kiss Cam at a Coldplay concert. The video raised questions about workplace ethics and corporate culture—especially ironic for a company that sells itself on reliability and control.Astronomer doesn’t build rockets, but it helps companies launch and maintain something just as mission-critical: the smooth, timely flow of data. And as AI becomes more ubiquitous, the systems that feed it—quiet, backend tools like Astro—are becoming some of the most important software in the world.The Coldplay scandal may fade. But Astronomer’s role in the AI economy is only growing.","Astronomer is a tech company that helps large organisations manage and automate their data workflows.

"BP energy shift: Oil giant to sell US onshore wind assets to LS Power, trims $5 bn from clean push",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bp-energy-shift-oil-giant-to-sell-us-onshore-wind-assets-to-ls-power-trims-5-bn-from-clean-push/articleshow/122767989.cms,"BP has announced it will sell its entire onshore wind energy business in the United States to American firm LS Power, marking a major step in its shift away from renewables and back toward oil and gas. The sale includes 10 operational wind assets, though the deal value was not disclosed.“The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward,” said William Lin, BP’s executive vice president for gas and low carbon energy, quoted AFP.Lin added that low-carbon energy will continue to have a place in BP’s simplified and more focused business model, but the company would keep rationalising its portfolio to create more value.LS Power CEO Paul Segal said the acquisition, expected to close by the end of 2025, would “help to meet growing energy demand across the US.”The move comes after BP, once seen as an industry leader in climate goals, reversed course in February by scaling back its emissions reduction targets and slashing its clean energy investments. It is now prioritising higher returns from oil and gas, under investor pressure to improve its share performance.As part of the revised strategy, BP plans to cut over $5 billion annually from clean energy spending and divest $20 billion in assets by 2027.BP's rival Shell has similarly pared back its climate ambitions in recent months.","BP to sell its entire onshore wind energy business in the United States to LS Power.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

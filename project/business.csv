Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) is a market leader in aerospace defence. It boasts a strong order book of ₹1.8t as of Mar '25, along with a promising prospect pipeline of ₹6t, which is likely to be awarded over next few years. HAL is transitioning from traditional licensed model to indigenized model and is currently working on marque projects such as Tejas Mk1, Tejas Mk1a, Su-30 upgrade, Dornier-25, and LUH, et al. These projects are anticipated to fuel manufacturing revenue growth for HAL. Near-term catalysts will emerge with aircraft deliveries as GE engine supplies resumes for Tejas Mk1A from FY26, while medium to long term triggers hinge on order finalizations for 97 Tejas Mk1A, Tejas Mk-II, LUH, AMCA and others. We initiate coverage on HAL with BUY rating & TP ₹5,100. We estimate 29%/33%/29% revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR over FY25-27.Brent Crude has fallen to its 4-year low amid US-China trade tensions and rising supply.This is beneficial for lubricant companies like Castrol, potentially leading to improved profit margins. As part of its future plans for advanced EV and data center testing, Castrol opened a technology center in Patalganga, equipped with blending & testing capabilities. For its lubricant business, it is targeting above industry average growth rate of 4-5%. Management is optimistic about India’s lubricant demand potential, driven by low car penetration. Castrol's focus on brand building, distribution, and new products supports its market leadership. We estimate ~23% EBITDA margin for CY25 and CY26, reflecting confidence in profitability and growth.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting April 21, 2025) are Hindustan Aeronautics and Castrol.

GST on UPI transactions: Government denies reports of levying GST on UPI transactions over Rs 2000,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/false-misleading-government-denies-reports-of-levying-gst-on-upi-transactions-over-rs-2000/articleshow/120408353.cms,"The government on Friday denied reports suggesting GST levying on UPI transactions exceeding Rs 2,000, calling such claims “completely false, misleading, and without any basis. ”In an official statement, the finance ministry said, “Currently, there is no such proposal before the government,” dismissing concerns that had surfaced earlier.The ministry also clarifyed the tax framework, explaining that GST is only applicable on charges like the merchant discount rate (MDR), which are relevant for certain payment methods.However, in January 2020, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) eliminated MDR on person-to-merchant (P2M) UPI transactions.“Since currently no MDR is charged on UPI transactions, there is consequently no GST applicable to these transactions,” the ministry stated.UPI, or Unified Payments Interface , has witnessed a remarkable surge in usage, with transaction values skyrocketing from Rs 21.3 lakh crore in 2019-20 to a soaring Rs 260.56 lakh crore, that was projected by the end of March 2025.To further encourage this growth, the government has been running an incentive scheme since 2021-22, specifically aimed at low-value P2M UPI transactions.The initiative is designed to support small merchants by absorbing transaction costs and driving broader adoption of digital payments.In the last financial year, 2023-24, Rs 3,631 crore was disbursed under this scheme, a sharp rise from Rs 2,210 crore in 2022-23. In FY 2021-2011, the allocation was Rs 1,389 crore.“The total incentive payouts under this scheme over the years reflect the government's sustained commitment to promoting UPI-based digital payments,” the ministry added.The press release said that India accounted for 49 per cent of worldwide real time transactions in 2023, as per the ACI Worldwide report 2024.","GST is only applicable on charges like the merchant discount rate (MDR), which are relevant for certain payment methods.

NEW DELHI: In a significant shift towards more frequent economic data dissemination, the Central government will begin releasing unemployment figures on a monthly basis starting May 15, a senior official from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation announced on Monday.According to PTI, the initial release will cover data for the months of January, February, and March, and subsequent reports will be published each month thereafter.“This is the first time that we are doing it,” the official stated, emphasizing the government's commitment to increasing the frequency and transparency of labour market data Until now, India has been publishing urban unemployment data on a quarterly basis and combined rural-urban unemployment statistics annually. Unlike other major economies, India has lacked a system for high-frequency unemployment data collection and dissemination.The official assured that the new data collection process is statistically robust and representative, with internal consistency checks being carried out to ensure accuracy.The official also confirmed that the government will meet its previously announced timeline to release private capital expenditure data by the end of April.Looking ahead, the government plans to expand the scope of data collection further. According to PTI, beginning next year, findings from a survey of service sector enterprises will also be published.Additionally, the government is working towards releasing data on the informal sector—collected through the annual survey of the unincorporated sector—on a quarterly basis, the official revealed.In another notable development, a quarterly periodic labour force survey for rural areas is also in the pipeline.""Data is the new oil, and there is a need for it to be both credible and timely,"" the official stated, adding that Indian statistics are globally regarded as robust, credible, and transparent.","The Central government will begin releasing unemployment figures on a monthly basis starting May 15.

The sensex reclaimed the 79K level, while the Nifty rose above the 24K mark, both after more than four months. The BSE bankex rallied over 2% to a new all-time high during the day’s session.The rally was driven by investors’ perception that, with a relatively smaller export share in global trade and a large domestic market, India could emerge mostly unscathed from the current global trade war , market players said. Banking stocks gained due to several tailwinds, such as the RBI’s liquidity infusion measures, a falling inflation rate, and expectations of an above-normal monsoon, combined, analysts noted.However, the sustainability of the rally on Dalal Street was clouded by evening after US markets opened deep in the red, anticipating a clash between US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. All three leading US indices—Dow Jones, S, and Nasdaq Composite—were down more than 2% each.Meanwhile, at close of Monday’s trading, sensex was up 855 points or 1.1% at 79,409 points, while Nifty was up 274 points or 1.2% at 24,126 points. According to Devarsh Vakil, head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, with a large, domestically driven economy and low reliance on exports, especially to the US, Indian markets were relatively insulated from tariff-related worries. Investor sentiment was also buoyed by solid earnings reports and positive management commentary from key banks, Vakil said. Foreign funds net bought stocks worth another Rs 1,970 crore on Monday, taking the aggregate net flows for the last four sessions to about Rs 17,000 crore, NSDL and BSE data showed.The sudden reversal in foreign flows, combined with the weakness of the dollar against most major currencies, led to the strengthening of the rupee in recent weeks. On Monday, the rupee closed at 85.13 to the dollar, its strongest level since mid-Dec.Among the sensex stocks, HDFC Bank , Reliance Industries, Infosys, and Axis Bank contributed the most.","The sensex reclaimed the 79K level, while the Nifty rose above the 24K mark.

Gensol Engineering under ED scanner over alleged links to Mahadev betting app scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gensol-engineering-under-ed-scanner-over-alleged-links-to-mahadev-betting-app-scandal/articleshow/120502125.cms,"Gensol Engineering promoters Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi

Background: Mahadev Book app syndicate

Sebi scrutiny of Gensol Engineering

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is preparing to question Gensol Engineering promoters, Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi, in connection with the ongoing investigation into the Mahadev Book app illegal betting and money laundering case, according to sources cited by the Economic Times.While formal summons have not yet been issued, the ED has frozen over 500,000 shares of Gensol Engineering. These shares were previously held by Dubai-based Zenith Multi Trading DMCC, an entity linked to accused Hari Shankar Tibrewal, an accused in the Mahadev betting app case. Investigators suspect that the shares were part of a scheme involving artificial stock price manipulation using tainted funds routed through foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).A senior government official stated, ""The probe has revealed stock manipulation using tainted funds in the Mahadev app case, which were received in Gensol Engineering through the FPI routes. The probe will ascertain whether the promoters were aware of this fact.""The ED recently attached assets worth Rs 573 crore related to the illegal betting network, including securities and demat holdings linked to Gensol. BSE data shows that as of December 2024, the ED’s Raipur Zonal Office holds 1.37 percent of Gensol’s equity.On April 16, the ED conducted coordinated searches across multiple cities, including the residence of EaseMyTrip founder Nishant Pitti in New Delhi. The agency is focused on uncovering how illicit funds were funneled into the market via preferential share allotments and promoter-controlled stock sales to manipulate Gensol’s share price.The Mahadev probe has expanded significantly, with the ED conducting searches at 170 premises and seizing assets worth over Rs 3,002 crore. Thirteen individuals have been arrested, and 74 entities have been named across five prosecution complaints. The investigation includes tracking money flows into offshore properties and cryptocurrency investments.The Mahadev Book app is allegedly at the center of a massive illegal betting and money laundering network. The syndicate is believed to have laundered over Rs 5,500 crore, investing the proceeds in cryptocurrencies, shell companies, and overseas real estate. The key accused, Saurabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal, are reported to have fled India and acquired Vanuatu citizenship.The ED’s May 2024 supplementary chargesheet outlines how funds were laundered using foreign entities and stock investments, identifying Tibrewal’s Dubai connection and Suraj Chokhani’s involvement in suspicious share deals.The ED scrutiny comes as Gensol Engineering is also under investigation by Sebi for alleged financial misconduct, misleading public disclosures, and fund diversion.Sebi’s interim order earlier this month alleged out that there was no real manufacturing activity at Gensol’s EV facility in Pune, despite the company’s claims of having secured 30,000 pre-orders. A site visit by NSE found only two to three workers on-site and minimal electricity usage, suggesting the plant was largely inactive.The EV pre-orders were reportedly found to be non-binding memorandums of understanding, lacking pricing details or delivery timelines. Additional concerns included a questionable deal with Refex Green Mobility that was later withdrawn and the inflated valuation of a US subsidiary sale. Out of Rs 977.75 crore in loans raised, over Rs 260 crore is reportedly unaccounted for, with funds allegedly misused for luxury expenses and transferred to entities linked to the promoters.As a result, Sebi barred the Jaggi brothers from holding market or executive positions. Their exit has also triggered a major operational halt at affiliate BluSmart, which suspended its electric cab services following the revelations.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is preparing to question Gensol Engineering promoters, Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi, in connection with the ongoing investigation into the Mahadev Book app illegal betting and money laundering case.

Google to pay Rs 20 crore to settle Android TV case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/google-to-pay-rs-20-crore-to-settle-android-tv-case/articleshow/120497556.cms,"NEW DELHI: Google has opted for a settlement with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and payment of a penalty of Rs 20.2 crore in the Android TV issue, where the fairplay regulator found a prima facie case of abuse of dominant position by the global tech giant.This follows the two penalties that CCI previously slapped on Google, regarding its Play Store policies and its dominance in the Android operating system.In the TV case, Google filed a settlement application under Section 48A of the Competition Act, giving consent for a 'New India Agreement', under which it will provide a standalone licence for the Play Store and Play Services for Android smart TVs in India. This will remove the requirement to bundle these services or impose default placement conditions, CCI said.

Gold rate today: Gold prices surged by Rs 1,650 in Delhi on Monday, inching closer to the psychological Rs 1 lakh per 10 grams mark, driven by a weakening dollar and growing uncertainties surrounding the US-China trade war. According to the All India Sarafa Association, 99.9% purity gold reached Rs 99,800 per 10 grams, up from Rs 98,150 per 10 grams on Friday, when it had fallen by Rs 20.Gold of 99.5% purity saw a rise of Rs 1,600, reaching a new high of Rs 99,300 per 10 grams, after settling at Rs 97,700 per 10 grams in the previous market close, as per news agency PTI.This year, gold prices have seen a substantial increase of Rs 20,850, or 26.41%, per 10 grams since December 31, 2024.Silver also gained Rs 500, reaching Rs 98,500 per kg, after closing at Rs 98,000 per kg on Friday.Satish Dondapati, Fund Manager at Kotak Mahindra AMC, attributed the price movement to ongoing trade tensions, expectations of rate cuts, geopolitical uncertainties, and the weakening dollar. He highlighted that gold prices have surged over 25% this year, with a 6% increase since April 2, when the US administration announced new tariffs.On the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold futures for June delivery surged by Rs 1,621 (1.7%) to reach a fresh high of Rs 96,875 per 10 grams.In international markets, spot gold touched a record high of USD 3,397.18 per ounce, before slightly paring gains to trade at USD 3,393.49 per ounce. Gold futures also crossed the psychological USD 3,400 per ounce mark for the first time ever, rising by USD 80 (2.4%).Pranav Mer, Vice President of Commodity & Currency Research at JM Financial Services, explained that gold’s rise was driven by trade tariff uncertainty, the weakening US dollar, and rising Treasury yields. He noted that increased buying activity from ETF investors and festive demand in India are providing additional support for the yellow metal.Kaynat Chainwala, AVP of Commodity Research at Kotak Securities, pointed out that gold’s rally is also being fueled by a fall in the US dollar to a three-year low and intensified safe-haven buying following President Donald Trump 's threat to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Spot silver in the Asian market rose nearly 1% to USD 32.85 per ounce.Chintan Mehta, CEO of Abans Financial Services, mentioned that market participants will be closely monitoring President Trump’s evolving tariff strategy and the potential economic impact, as well as the Federal Open Market Committee’s statements, for clues on the future direction of interest rates.

"Dollar hits 3-year low, Dow slips 2% as Fed’s independence escalates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dollar-hits-3-year-low-dow-slips-2-as-feds-independence-escalates/articleshow/120491171.cms,"US President Donald Trump 's renewed attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the central bank's independence are stirring market uncertainty, contributing to the US dollar hitting a three-year low.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major foreign currencies, fell to 97.92 on Monday, marking its lowest level since March 2022, according to FactSet data. As of 10:00 a.m. ET, the index was down 1.1% on the day, trading at 98.24.Investors, grappling with trade tensions and Fed policy concerns, are increasingly turning to alternative safe-haven assets, like gold, which surged to a record high on Monday.As of 10:54 AM GMT-4 on April 21, U.S. stock markets experienced significant losses, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping 834.74 points, or 2.13%, to 38,307.49. The Nasdaq Composite declined by 425.39 points, or 2.61%, to 15,861.05, and the S&P 500 fell 118.24 points, or 2.24%, to 5,164.46. In contrast, gold prices surged, rising by 102 points, or 3.06%, to reach 3,430.4,Trump lashed out at Powell on social media again on Monday, calling him a “major loser” and demanding that the Fed cut interest rates.The President’s attacks came after comments from Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, who revealed last week that the Trump administration was “studying” the possibility of removing Powell.Hassett noted that “new legal analysis” would be necessary before deciding whether Trump could or should terminate the Fed chief, marking a shift from his earlier stance of supporting the Fed’s independence.While experts argue that Trump likely lacks the authority to dismiss Powell over policy differences, especially with the central bank’s long-standing independence, the President’s willingness to break norms and confront the Fed signals potential turbulence for US markets.Powell himself, who was appointed by Trump in 2018, acknowledged the significant economic risks posed by Trump’s trade tariffs. Speaking at an event in Chicago last week, Powell warned that the tariffs, unprecedented in their scale, could stoke inflation and dampen growth, complicating the Fed’s ability to cut rates to support the economy.Concerns over the Fed’s independence and Trump’s ongoing trade war are fuelling market jitters, with analysts warning that investors may begin losing confidence in the US financial system.Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, noted that Trump’s criticism of Powell serves as a reminder that trade policy is not the only avenue through which unconventional presidential actions could undermine the dollar and US markets, as per CNN report.Indeed, the dollar has faced significant pressure this year, falling to 140.76 yen — its weakest level since September. Analysts are attributing this decline to growing investor unease over the Trump administration’s economic policies, including its ongoing trade war and tariffs. While the US dollar traditionally benefits in times of market volatility, the flight from the dollar, alongside a lack of progress on trade talks, is signalling broader concerns about the stability of the US economy.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note also rose on Monday, reaching 4.365% after a public holiday on Friday. With the Fed’s upcoming meeting in early May, traders are keenly watching whether the central bank will make any adjustments to interest rates amid the growing uncertainty. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 88% of traders expect the Fed to maintain current rates.As Trump’s trade war and tariffs continue to dominate headlines, European markets are becoming increasingly attractive to investors, who view the US dollar and US assets as more uncertain.Meanwhile, gold continues to see robust demand as a safe haven, with prices surging more than 2% on Monday to hit a fresh record high of over $3,400 per ounce. Gold has been on an impressive rally this year, up more than 27% so far, outpacing its performance throughout 2024.The earnings season is also in full swing this week, with investors looking closely at the first-quarter results from major tech firms. Tesla, which will release its earnings on Tuesday, and Alphabet, set to report on Thursday, are expected to offer insights into how companies are navigating the uncertain economic landscape shaped by tariffs and trade tensions.As the global economic environment remains volatile, analysts, including Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, expect that tariff concerns will remain a dominant theme in the coming months, even as investor attention shifts to corporate earnings.","US dollar falls to three-year low against a basket of major foreign currencies.

US stocks experienced a sharp decline on Monday as concerns about US President Donald Trump ’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve prompt investors to pull back from US markets.As of 4:10 p.m. ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 953 points (-2.4%) to 38,170.41. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.6%, closing at 15,870.90, while the S&P 500 also saw a steep decline of 174.74 points (-2.4%), settling at 5,158.20.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to 35.57, an increase of 19.97%, signaling increased investor anxiety. The surge in volatility came amid concerns over global economic risks and domestic political tensions. Despite the turmoil in the equity markets, gold continued its upward trajectory, rising 3.09% to $3,431.20 per ounce as investors sought safe-haven assets amid the broader market selloff.The US dollar showed resilience during the session, with the EUR/USD pair climbing 0.992% to 1.15, as the currency benefited from market uncertainty. Meanwhile, oil prices remained under pressure, dropping 2.55% to $63.03 per barrel, reflecting concerns over global demand. The 10-year US Treasury yield also saw an increase of 1.664%, reaching 4.399%, indicating rising demand for government bonds as a safer investment.More concerning, the value of the US dollar has also weakened as a retreat from US markets continues. This move is unusual, as the dollar has typically strengthened during times of market nervousness.However, this time, policies from Washington are fuelling fears and potentially eroding the dollar’s reputation as a global economic pillar and a safe investment.Trump continued his hardliner stance on global trade over the weekend, even as economists and investors warn that his proposed tariffs could lead to a recession if not reversed. US negotiations with Japan last week have failed to reach an agreement that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, with the talks being viewed as a ""test case,"" according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.“The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump posted in all capital letters on his Truth Social Network over the weekend. He added that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” also in all caps.Trump has increasingly focused on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which has escalated its rhetoric against the US China warned on Monday that other countries should not make trade deals with the US “at the expense of China’s interests,” as Japan, South Korea, and others negotiate agreements.“If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement.Compounding market concerns are Trump’s ongoing criticisms of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Last week, Trump again targeted Powell for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy a boost. The Fed has been hesitant to lower rates too quickly to avoid reigniting inflation after it has nearly reached its 2% target, down from more than 9% three years ago.On Monday, Trump again called for action, suggesting a slowdown in the US economy unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates.”If Trump were to move to fire Powell, it could send shockwaves through financial markets. While lower interest rates tend to benefit stocks and other investments, the larger concern would be that a less independent Fed could struggle to control inflation in the long run. This would further undermine, if not destroy, the US reputation as the safest place in the world to hold cash.Meanwhile, several Big Tech stocks contributed to the market decline ahead of their earnings reports later this week. Tesla, for example, dropped 6.7%. The electric vehicle maker's stock was already 50% below its record set in December due to criticism that its stock price had become too inflated and that its brand had become overly associated with Elon Musk, who is leading efforts to cut US government spending.On the positive side, Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial saw gains after the US government approved their proposed merger. Discover surged 3%, while Capital One rose 0.9%.In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors held onto hopes that the Fed may cut its key overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy. However, longer-term yields fluctuated as doubts about the US economy's standing in the global market mounted. The yield on the 10-year Treasury reached 4.40% in the morning, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from about 4% earlier this month. It later retreated to 4.34%.The US dollar also weakened against the euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and other currencies.Abroad, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.3%, while stocks in Seoul rose by 0.2%, and Shanghai’s index gained 0.4%.","Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 953 points (-2.4%) to 38,170.41.

Report: China tells its airlines to halt deliveries of new Boeing aircrafts and parts

A second Boeing jet meant for a Chinese airline is on its way back to the US on Monday, according to flight tracking data, reported Reuters. A Boeing 737 MAX intended for Xiamen Airlines in China made an unexpected return to the US on Sunday, landing at Boeing Field in Seattle.The jet was one of several 737 MAX aircraft that had been waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion centre in China for final work and delivery, reported The Guardian. However, the trade war between the US and China, triggered by us president Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports, has now disrupted this plan.As of this month, Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with its own 125% tariffs on US-made products, including aircraft. The imposition of these tariffs presents a significant problem for Chinese airlines, as the 737 MAX, Boeing’s bestselling model, has a market value of approximately $55 million. The tariffs could make it financially unfeasible for Chinese airlines to take delivery of these jets. Beijing is reportedly considering measures to support its airlines, particularly those leasing Boeing jets, to mitigate the increased costs.The confusion surrounding the changing tariffs has left many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline executives indicating they may delay aircraft deliveries rather than incur the extra costs. The situation is also having a broader impact on Boeing, which has a substantial order backlog, including around 130 jets for Chinese customers, according to reports. Analysts warn that the uncertainty over the tariffs could disrupt not only Boeing’s delivery schedules but also the entire aircraft manufacturing sector, which relies heavily on international sales.At a US Senate hearing earlier this month, Boeing’s CEO Kelly Ortberg had expressed concerns about the possibility of certain markets closing off to the company due to these tariff battles. While the details of which party decided to return the jet to the US remain unclear, it highlights the significant impact the ongoing trade war is having on the aviation industry.","A Boeing 737 MAX intended for Xiamen Airlines in China made an unexpected return to the US on Sunday, landing at Boeing Field in Seattle.

‘Magnificent seven’ loom around uncertainty and turmoil amid Trump's turbulence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/magnificent-seven-loom-around-uncertainty-and-turmoil-amid-trumps-turbulence/articleshow/120473610.cms,"Leading tech firms loom around economic disturbance and uncertainty as they set to report the first-quarter earnings this week. The return of Donald Trump to the White House is one of the key reasons behind the current state of these big firms. Reciprocal tariffs and unstable markets have impacted the performance of the global economy.The ‘magnificent seven’- which includes Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet (google parent), are the leading firms of the technology sector and firms have altogether seen a blow of 22 per cent, which is $3.8 trillion from its market value as of Sunday.“The mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,” said Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities.The current rollercoaster in the market stands in stark contrast to the expectations and optimism once showcased by the heads of these seven firms- Apple’s Tim Cook, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos — who appeared in rare harmony as they stood by US President Donald Trump at his January inauguration.The support of these heads was not only symbolic- rather it was rooted in a calculated move that Trump’s comeback would ease the trade regulations, earlier set up by former President Joe Biden.Rather than reaping the expected benefits, big tech now finds itself struggling to protect its footing.The Trump administration’s hardline trade agenda — especially the sweeping reciprocal tariffs unveiled on April 2 — has disturbed global supply chains and overturned corporate planning. While a temporary suspension of the harshest tariffs and exemptions for Chinese electronics imports have offered momentary relief, President Trump has signaled that this grace period may be short-lived.Alongside the trade tensions, Trump’s administration is still going after big tech with antitrust cases that started under former President Biden. Meta is being sued for allegedly running an illegal monopoly in social media, and Alphabet is fighting efforts to break up its control over online search. Apple and Amazon are also still under investigation and facing lawsuits.Trumps' call to ban Nvidia from selling a key AI chip to China has resulted in a $5.5 billion charge tied to its unsold inventory of processors earmarked for Chinese markets.With the onset of the earnings season, the heads of these big techs will be under pressure as they navigate their way through the current turmoil- both economic and political. With political challenges and shaken market confidence, this earnings season could be one of the most important for Big Tech in recent years.Tesla will report first on Tuesday, after revealing a 13 per cent drop in car sales amid protests over Elon Musk’s involvement in the administration's cost-cutting efforts. Google parent Alphabet will follow on Thursday, with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple reporting next week. Nvidia, operating on a different fiscal schedule, will finish earnings season with its report on May 28.","The'magnificent seven'- Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet- are the leading firms of the technology sector.

'Mickey Mouse is smarter’: Economist Jeffrey Sachs mocks Donald Trump over tariff policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mickey-mouse-is-smarter-economist-jeffrey-sachs-mocks-donald-trump-over-tariff-policy/articleshow/120451544.cms,"'King Donald...': Jeffery Sachs GOES OFF On Trump Tariffs; Urges World To NOT Live In 'Crazy Land'

Renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump 's tariff strategy, calling the US president’s trade policies so “delusional” that even Mickey Mouse would know better.Not mincing any words, Sachs delivered a harsh critique of Donald Trump’s trade policies, declaring that Trump’s understanding of trade is so fundamentally flawed that “he wouldn’t pass a basic economics class.”He condemned the president’s fixation on trade deficits as both “childish and dangerous.”Sachs attributed a staggering $10 trillion loss in global wealth to Trump’s economic strategies and cautioned that the United States is edging toward authoritarianism, characterised by “one-man rule by emergency decree.”Rejecting Trump’s accusations that other countries are “cheating” the US, Sachs argued that the real issue is not trade but excessive US government spending.Speaking at a public forum, Sachs recounted Trump’s justification for levying tariffs on countries like Lesotho. “What Trump said was, ‘Lesotho sells us more than we buy from them, so they’re cheating us.’ That is literally what he said,” Sachs explained. “It’s completely delusional.”According to Sachs, Trump’s team then scrambled to create a formula to impose tariffs on countries like Lesotho based purely on the trade imbalance.“They made some absolutely stupid formula that you would not accept in a first-year, third-week economics class. It came out of the US Trade Representative’s office. They probably were told, ‘Do it overnight, the boss wants it,’” he said.Sachs described the result as a list of tariffs calculated on a country-by-country basis, an approach he deemed utterly senseless. “You cannot make this stuff up,” he said. “This used to be not a Mickey Mouse country, my country. But this is Mickey Mouse. And I apologise to Mickey Mouse—he would not do this. Mickey Mouse is smarter than this.”Sachs, a long-time critic of both political parties’ failure to tackle inequality, accused Trump of selling “a pseudo explanation” and “a pseudo remedy” for economic discontent. “What Trump is doing is giving a story to swing states like Michigan and Ohio—it’s China’s fault, it’s Mexico’s fault, it’s Lesotho’s fault.”He also pointed out that the loss of manufacturing jobs in the American Midwest was driven more by automation than trade. “Now if you go to an automotive plant, it’s all robots,” Sachs said. “That’s not because the jobs went overseas—it’s because the assembly line itself became an automated phenomenon.”On broader global challenges, Sachs expressed alarm at Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and promote coal. “Yesterday, King Donald issued an executive decree to bring back coal. It’s willful destruction of wellbeing. Willful,” he said, adding that the rest of the world must avoid entering what he called “crazy land.”The President has claimed tariffs are a powerful tool for economic leverage. Earlier this month, he announced sweeping new tariffs on almost all trading partners, only to reverse most of them a week later after a market downturn. “We’re making a fortune with tariffs. $2 billion a day. Do you believe it?” Trump said at a recent Republican event.However, official figures tell a different story. According to US Customs and Border Protection, the actual figure collected from customs duties is just over $260 million per day. Despite Trump’s claims, the real economic benefit of his tariff policies appears far less significant than he suggests.",Renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump's tariff strategy.

Opening for Chinese tech giants

Strategic concerns

As the Trump administration escalates its efforts to restrict semiconductor exports to China, industry experts warn that the move could have unintended consequences, namely, accelerating China’s domestic chip innovation and eroding US dominance in the global semiconductor market , AFP reported.The latest restrictions require US chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to obtain licenses before exporting high-performance processors to China, over concerns they could be used in military or supercomputing applications.But analysts say this pressure might push Chinese companies to become more self-reliant—and more competitive.“What’s actually happening is that the US government right now is handing China a big win as it tries to get their own chip business going,” said Jack Gold, principal analyst at J Gold Associates. “Once they’re competitive, they’ll start selling around the world and people will buy their chips.”In regulatory filings this week, Nvidia said the licensing requirements could cost the company up to $5.5 billion (Rs 45,870 crore) in lost sales. AMD estimates a potential revenue hit of $800 million (Rs 6,672 crore) due to the export restrictions.Nvidia had developed its H20 chip specifically for the Chinese market, carefully optimizing performance while staying within earlier US trade rules.Now, those chips require government approval before being shipped.AMD faces similar hurdles with its MI308 GPU line, designed for AI and gaming applications. The company stated there is ""no guarantee"" licenses will be granted.Experts believe the restrictions are creating a major opportunity for Chinese firms like Huawei to accelerate efforts to dominate the chip landscape.“It’s going to be a godsend for China as they spin up their own microprocessor business ,” said independent tech analyst Rob Enderle. “This will be a really quick way to hand over US leadership in microprocessors and GPUs.”China, which already invests heavily in its chip sector, is likely to increase spending and policy support to close the technology gap.“The worldwide economy is not like that,” Gold said, pointing to Trump’s aggressive trade policies. “You can’t just bully people. These tariffs are alienating allies, and they might start turning to China for chips instead.”Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has tried to downplay the impact, saying the company will remain compliant while continuing to push technological boundaries. But some analysts see the situation as part of a larger geopolitical struggle.“The Trump administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI revolution and it’s Nvidia,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. “So it placed a ‘Do Not Enter’ sign in front of China.”Ives warned that the conflict is far from over. “We expect more punches to be thrown by both sides,” he said.As US firms brace for export losses, the race to build the next generation of semiconductors is entering a new, uncertain phase—one where China may gain speed rather than slow down.",US chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to obtain licenses before exporting high- performance processors to China.

Tariffs and labour costs push jet prices higher as Boeing and Airbus navigate turbulent skies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariffs-and-labour-costs-push-jet-prices-higher-as-boeing-and-airbus-navigate-turbulent-skies/articleshow/120448811.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Commercial plane prices are set to rise as aviation giants are facing added pressure amid US President Donald Trump's tariff push against global trade.The cost of planes has already soared by about 30 per cent since 2018, largely due to post-pandemic supply chain issues and rising input costs. Additionally, materials like titanium, energy and essential components have become significantly more expensive.The situation has been further aggravated by geopolitical factors, including the exclusion of Russian titanium suppliers from the US market.""Anything titanium... especially since all that Russian capacity has been cut off from the US and, to a lesser extent, from Europe” has inflated at a particularly high rate,"" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory.Aboulafia estimates that material and equipment costs have climbed by about 40 per cent since 2021. He also pointed out the impact of US President Donald Trump’s 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium, which are crucial for aircraft production. “It’s kind of ironic, raw materials were not a problem, but Donald Trump is determined to make them a problem,” he said.Labour costs are also playing a major role in driving up prices. Boeing recently signed a new contract with its Seattle machinists' union, raising wages by 38 per cent over four years.Spirit AeroSystems, a key supplier to both Airbus and Boeing, agreed to a similar wage hike earlier.Editor-in-chief at Aircraft Value News John Persinos claimed that inflation in aviation is worsening and warned, “these tariffs are disastrous.”Despite the price surge, official catalogue listings from both Boeing and Airbus have not kept pace. Boeing hasn’t updated its list since 2023, while Airbus has stuck with 2018 figures.However, catalogue prices are widely considered unreliable. “Catalogue prices were a complete work of fiction,” said Aboulafia. “You got 50 per cent off for showing up dressed nicely.”Airbus confirmed it abandoned catalogue pricing because the final cost is highly variable depending on the aircraft’s configuration and other negotiated factors like pilot training and maintenance support.Contracts also typically include inflation-linked adjustments and can be modified if there are delivery delays or currency fluctuations.In February 2025, All Nippon Airways placed a major order for 77 aircraft from Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer, offering a rare glimpse into updated pricing. As per AFP calculations, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was priced at around $386 million, a significant jump from $292 million in 2023. The 737 MAX was listed at $159 million, up from $121.6 million, while the Airbus A321neo rose to $148 million from $129.5 million in the 2018 catalogue.Despite these rising costs, aircraft pricing remains competitive due to intense rivalry between Boeing and Airbus. As the aviation expert explained, “The two companies fight for every transaction and that impacts pricing.”","Cost of planes has already soared by about 30 per cent since 2018, largely due to post-pandemic supply chain issues and rising input costs. materials like titanium, energy and essential components have become significantly more expensive.

"Trump tariffs offer hope for US small manufacturers, but uncertainty clouds outlook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariffs-offer-hope-for-us-small-manufacturers-but-uncertainty-clouds-outlook/articleshow/120432527.cms,"Rising concerns over economic instability

A push for reshoring American manufacturing

As the Trump administration doubles down on tariffs to shift global trade dynamics, small US manufacturers are divided — some see opportunity, while others warn that unpredictability may outweigh any potential gain.Drew Greenblatt, president of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore, is among the strongest supporters. His company, which employs 115 workers across three states, makes wire baskets and racks for the aerospace, medical, and food processing sectors — all using American-sourced steel, as reported news agency AP.Greenblatt argues that his company faces steep competition from foreign producers benefiting from long-standing trade advantages. In particular, he says European tariffs make it far costlier for German customers to buy US products than for Americans to buy imports from Europe.“It’s wildly unfair to the American worker,” Greenblatt said. “And this has, by the way, been going on for decades.”The Trump administration has labelled US manufacturing a national security and economic priority, aiming to reverse decades of decline. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, manufacturing employment in the US peaked at 19.6 million workers in 1979.By early 2025, that number had dropped to 12.8 million — a 35% decline — with small manufacturers, who make up 99% of the sector, bearing much of the impact.Tariffs, the administration argues, will incentivize more domestic production and lead to better-paying jobs for Americans in sectors like automotive, electronics, and household goods. Greenblatt is hopeful — he says achieving tariff parity with other countries could allow his company to double its workforce.However, not all small business owners are convinced. For many, economic uncertainty sparked by the tariff policies is creating hesitation and anxiety.Corry Blanc, founder of Blanc Creatives in Waynesboro, Virginia, manufactures artisanal cookware using American steel and wood. While he supports domestic manufacturing, Blanc is concerned about the unpredictable nature of the current trade landscape.“There’s so much uncertainty and not a lot of direction,” he said, adding that his international customers are expressing concern. His company, which employs 12 staff members, lacks the infrastructure to suddenly ramp up production if demand increases.Michael Lyons, owner of Rogue Industries in Maine, which makes leather wallets and accessories, echoed similar worries. His company uses domestically sourced leather and produces 80% of its goods in the US Despite this, he recently lost a long-time Canadian client due to cross-border trade tensions.“Hopefully this will pass, and he’ll be able to come back,” Lyons said. “But it’s a real indicator of the friction these policies are causing.”For now, Lyons has shelved expansion plans, saying, “It’s probably going to be, we hold with what we have.”Still, some entrepreneurs believe the tariffs could help reignite American industry. Bayard Winthrop, CEO of American Giant, a US-based clothing brand, says the country’s aggressive embrace of globalization over the past 40 years decimated domestic textile production.In 1991, 56% of US apparel was made domestically. By 2023, that figure had plunged to below 4%, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.Winthrop sources cotton from states like Georgia and North Carolina and manufactures his products in Los Angeles and North Carolina. He sees the current trade approach as a long-overdue effort to rebalance unfair trade with countries like China.“The imbalances in textiles, especially with China, are shocking,” he said. “This could finally give domestic manufacturers a fighting chance.”Winthrop acknowledges concerns about the Trump administration’s unpredictable policymaking, but urges Americans to focus on the long-term vision.“The idea that we’re going to be more protective of our domestic marketplace and have an industrial policy that includes manufacturing jobs is not new,” he said. “It’s an old idea — and it’s one worth revisiting.”","The Trump administration has labelled US manufacturing a national security and economic priority, aiming to reverse decades of decline.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

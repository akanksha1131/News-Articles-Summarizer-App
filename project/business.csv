Free trade & investment deals hit model BIT hurdle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/free-trade-investment-deals-hit-model-bit-hurdle/articleshow/116349160.cms,"NEW DELHI: From Saudi Arabia to the UK and the European Union to Sri Lanka, India's model bilateral investment treaty (BIT) and the finance ministry' steadfast refusal to tweak it is posing problems not just for trade negotiators but also for countries with which govt is seeking to work out investment arrangements.The issue of providing some carve outs has been discussed between officials recently, said a govt source.The discussions come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's trip to Saudi Arabia later this month, where the issue of setting up two refineries by Saudi Aramco - in Gujarat with ONGC and in Andhra Pradesh with BPCL - is likely to be on the agenda. In the past, the desert kingdom has expressed concerns over India's model BIT and it is one of the reasons for the talks on a bilateral trade deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council not making much headway.The issue is expected to crop up again when the British trade negotiators return to the table next month as the Keir Starmer seeks to engage with India to thrash out the details of the proposed free trade agreement (FTA) that has been in an on-off mode for over one-and-a-half decades.In 2016, govt had put in place the model BIT after it lost the case against White Industries in 2010. Subsequently, two British companies, Cairn Energy and Vodafone, used the arbitration clause after their investments in the country faced large tax claims on a retrospective basis. In fact, even the India-UK Infrastructure Financing Bridge, where British companies are seeking to execute projects and later invest in roads and green energy sector, has been discussed.India has, however, made concessions for UAE when it signed the FTA, which could be a precedent of sorts when it comes to negotiating other trade deals and investments, provided the other side is willing to agree to it.Maybe it's a negotiating position but the UK and the EU have shown no inclination and have insisted upon tweaks in the investment chapter to address their concerns around the model BIT.Even Sri Lanka during its engagement for widening the scope of the current trade agreement has flagged its concerns. While Singapore and South Korea still have a window to use the earlier BIT, instead of the model treaty, Indian officials have alerted Seoul to possible changes although it is unclear how it can be done.","The issue of providing some carve outs has been discussed between officials recently, said a govt source.

In an interview to TOI, she speaks about future investments by German companies and a partnership between Saxony and Tamil Nadu. Excerpts: How many German companies operate in Tamil Nadu and which are the top five?There are more than 120 German companies in Tamil Nadu, which include 100% subsidiaries and joint ventures. Major industrial sectors where German companies operate are auto and auto components, machinery for construction industry, information technology, footwear, and insurance. The top five German companies in Tamil Nadu are Daimler India Commercial Vehicles, BMW, Siemens, Schaeffler, and Schwing Stetter. Are more German companies looking to set up manufacturing or service sector facilities in Tamil Nadu?Yes, many more German companies plan to do so. For instance, a company named Startup Factory is coming to Tamil Nadu. It will help German entrepreneurs who want to invest in Tamil Nadu. It will offer office space and help to find land and so on. The company also has operations in countries such as China. What attracts companies from Germany to Tamil Nadu and to which sectors?Tamil Nadu is a prominent location in India for German investors due to the advanced infrastructure, highly qualified, young and talented manpower and a stable govt with good political leadership. The bilateral relations in Tamil Nadu are mostly in the two industrial hubs where German companies are invested or have business partners — Chennai and Coimbatore. And I think what always speaks in favour of Tamil Nadu is the high level of education and high level of skilled workforce, especially women. There is also land available, which is important to set up factories. The Tamil Nadu govt actively supports companies that want to come here. The sectors that German companies are interested in are manufacturing, shipping, logistics, consumer electronics, power, green hydrogen, and semiconductors. How many companies from Tamil Nadu operate in Germany?Around 25 Tamil Nadu companies operate in Germany spread across information technology, manufacturing, and automotive sectors. The interest of Tamil businessmen and businesswomen in Germany is big and vice versa. This is a reciprocal interest. How do you see the relationship between Tamil Nadu and Germany growing?We might think of an official partnership between Tamil Nadu and a German state. We already have two official partnerships. One between Bavaria and Karnataka and another between Baden-Württemberg and Maharashtra. Saxony is interested in having an official partnership with Tamil Nadu. This will boost relations. They are very strong in semiconductors. They have Silicon Saxony, where they operate semiconductor companies. So, that’s something really interesting to explore. There is no direct free trade agreement (FTA) between India and Germany. However, negotiations are underway between India and the European Union (EU) on an FTA. What is its status?Trade between India and Germany follows the rules of the WTO. We are looking forward to a swift conclusion of the FTA with the EU. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz underlined at the Indo-German govt consultations in Delhi in Oct 2024 that he wishes to see the FTA negotiations concluded as soon as possible, to give bilateral trade and investments a boost. We are interested in swift closure of these talks because we are an export-oriented economy.","German investors are attracted to Tamil Nadu because of its advanced infrastructure, young and talented manpower and stable govt, says consul-general of Germany in Chennai, Michaela Küchler.

Coined by political scientist Joseph Nye in the 1980s, ‘soft power’ is the ability to attract and persuade, and in the context of cities, it encompasses aspects such as culture, education, healthcare, tourism and governance, factors that can help improve its global reputation and snag skilled professionals, students and investors.Safety is considered an important soft power for businesses and expats as it directly influences relocation decisions and retention as well as attracts top talent. It also reduces anxiety of adapting to a new environment, especially for families and women professionals.In short, convincing people to move to Chennai is easier now than five years ago, says Siva Padmanabhan, managing director of AstraZeneca India. “We have found that for people moving into the city, adapting to the local language and accessing social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals are becoming less of an issue. The city is becoming better at accommodating newcomers,” he says.Aditya Mishra, managing director and CEO of CIEL HR Services, says there has been a clear increase in availability of quality multi-storied residential apartments, better schooling and healthcare facilities, which makes the city more appealing to a diverse workforce. “The proportion of non-local workers in white-collar jobs has increased in the past decade,” he says.For expats — Chennai has the third-largest expatriate population in India — the practical benefits are plenty. Koreans, Chennai’s largest expatriate community, are drawn to the city’s cultural familiarity as well. “Korea, with its blend of modernity and tradition, is a tough act to follow, yet the expat community says Chennai comes close. The markets here remind them of Korea 30 years ago,” says Rathi Jaffer, director of InKo Centre, a non-profit that explores Indian and Korean culture.The ability to communicate easily is another reason expats find Chennai easy to adapt to. While Tamil is the main language, English is widely spoken, making it easier for newcomers to settle in. “Several Koreans complete their undergraduate degrees here as education is in English and affordable. Most families also work out ways to stay longer here,” says Rathi.Chennai’s strategic location adds to its appeal. “The city is just a few hours from Singapore and Bangkok, making it convenient for holidays,” says Anupama Arvind, senior VP of Global Adjustments, a relocation service provider. “Expats often fall into two categories: young couples enticed by high pay and those nearing retirement, as India is still seen as a hardship destination with higher allowances for postings here. We have found that several of them sometimes accept lower pay or forgo promotions to stay back here,” she adds.Business growth is another key factor. The Randstad India Talent Insights Report 2024 indicates that Chennai has improved in terms of senior- and middle-level hiring, likely due to its career opportunities-quality of life mix. The demand for senior-level talent typically signals a city’s economic expansion, and Chennai has become a hub for industries such as automotive, pharma and finance.Livingcost.org, which compiles crowd-sourced data, estimates that living in Chennai is about 15% cheaper than Bengaluru, with lower costs across various aspects, including three-bedroom apartment prices, utility bills, gym memberships and international primary school fees. “These are essentials for middle- to senior-level professionals and families in the 30-50 age group,” says Anupama. “Particularly for expats and families with young children. Interestingly, many now also recommend the city to colleagues for its improved garbage management system, which directly improves the city’s liveability,” she adds.Chennai’s clubbing regulations though are its weakest link, say recruiters. “Most young professionals don’t want to relocate because entertainment options are restrictive, especially with alcohol restrictions and clubs shutting down before midnight,” says investment banker Giridharan Sampath.Still, Chennai’s other strengths continue to win over long-time residents. When Ajit Shetty moved from Mumbai to Chennai 20 years ago with nothing but a one-way ticket and a dream of starting a fitness club, he thought it would be a six-month experiment. “I never wanted to leave, even though my family is still in Mumbai,” says the 50-year-old CEO of Score and a self-proclaimed Chennai loyalist, despite not speaking a word of Tamil. Shetty says “the clear premium placed on education” in Chennai is one of its biggest draws. “You can see it in every field. Even in my area of fitness, I find trainers to be educated and highly driven, unlike in most other cities,” he says. Over the years, he says, some of his ventures have succeeded, while others faltered, but he remained because the city just let him be. “You may not find a nightlife here, but you will find a sense of belonging.”(With inputs by Vaitheeswaran B)","‘Soft power’ is the ability to attract and persuade, and in the context of cities, it encompasses aspects such as culture, education, healthcare, tourism and governance.

Indian companies raised record high of over Rs 1 lakh crore via QIP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-companies-raised-record-high-of-over-rs-1-lakh-crore-via-qip/articleshow/116343598.cms,"NEW DELHI: Fundraising through qualified institutional placements (QIPs) reached an all-time high in 2024, exceeding the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the first time. This milestone, fueled by strong stock market conditions and higher valuations, saw Indian companies raise Rs 1,21,321 crore via QIPs by November, as per data from the Prime Database.This marks an increase of over two times compared to the Rs 52,350 crore raised in the previous calendar year. Analysts highlighted that this growth highlights market resilience as a key driver, with companies expected to continue raising capital through QIPs.The data also revealed that 82 companies had accessed capital markets through QIP issues by November this year, compared to just 35 companies that raised Rs 38,220 crore during the same period last year.QIP is a fast-track method for listed companies and investment trusts to raise funds from institutional investors. It enables them to secure capital swiftly without the requirement of pre-issue filings to market regulators.Key players in this record-breaking year include the Vedanta group and food delivery giant Zomato, both raising Rs 8,500 crore each through QIPs. They were closely followed by Adani Energy Solutions and Varun Beverages, which raised Rs 8,373 crore and Rs 7,500 crore, respectively.The data also stated that JM Financial, a financial services company, emerged as the leading manager for QIP transactions, overseeing 16 issues.Chirag Negandhi, managing director at JM Financial Ltd told news agency PTI, ""In 2024, promoters have taken advantage of strong market conditions, leveraging higher valuations and upward trends in the secondary market to raise funds. Our performance reflects our superior distribution capabilities and our ability to handle complex transactions and achieve results for our clients.""Pranjal Srivastava, partner-investment banking at Centrum Capital, also resonated with the same views, ""CY 2024 has been a landmark year for all forms of public market fundraise, be it IPO, QIPs, or blocks. Listed companies raised record levels of funds through QIPs to meet their funding requirements"".Srivastava stated that the strong secondary markets, abundant domestic liquidity, and overall positive sentiment created an ideal environment for companies to raise funds, ensuring that all QIPs received strong subscription levels.""The record-breaking fund mobilisation by companies through QIP is the direct consequence of a booming stock market. Experience tells us that a booming secondary market leads to a booming IPO and QIP market,"" V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.The QIP route made a remarkable comeback in CY23, following a decline in 2022, the lowest in eight years when only Rs 11,743.29 crore was raised through 14 issues due to stock market volatility, high valuations, and other factors.The QIP surge this year reflects the strong inflow from retail and domestic investors. Given the Indian stock market's resilience over the past four years and ongoing institutional demand for quality issues, promoters are taking advantage of the favorable market conditions, Vijayakumar said.With Torrent Power, Bharat Forge, Senco Gold, and Sammaan Capital's QIP fundraising worth more than Rs 8,000 crore in December, analysts expect India Inc to go up further by the end of the calendar year, cementing 2024 as a milestone year for QIPs in India.","Fundraising through qualified institutional placements (QIPs) reached an all- time high in 2024.

Why World Bank cancelled $500 million loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-world-bank-cancelled-500-million-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/116317050.cms,"The PACE program

Attempts for lower electricity prices

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Gold rally may slow down in 2025: WGC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gold-rally-may-slow-down-in-2025-wgc/articleshow/116303894.cms,"Representative image

Gold prices are set to rise more slowly in 2025 after a record-breaking run this year, according to the World Gold Council .Bullion is up more than 30% so far in 2024, but gains next year will likely be tempered by variables like growth and inflation, the WGC said. Possible trade wars in US President-elect Donald Trump's second term and complicated interest-rate outlooks may spill over into subpar economic growth, hurting demand from investors and consumers, the industry association said in its 2025 outlook report released on Thursday.""All eyes are on the US. Trump's second term may provide a boost to the local economy but could equally elicit a fair degree of nervousness for investors around the world, it said.Bullion's rally in the early part of 2024 was driven by large purchases by central banks, especially the People's Bank of China and others in emerging markets. It got a further boost from the Federal Reserve's recent monetary easing and haven demand during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions including wars in West Asia and Ukraine. However, gains have stalled due to a rally in the dollar following Trump's election win.Some banks are still bullish on the prospects of the precious metal, currently trading near $2,700 an ounce, next year. Goldman Sachs Group is forecasting it will get to $3,000 by the end of 2025, while UBS AG sees $2,900.China's actions in the gold market will be closely watched. So far, investors there have provided price support, while consumers have stayed on the sidelines, but ""these dynamics hang on the direct (and indirect) effects of trade, stimulus and perceptions of risk,"" the WGC said.The yellow metal will rise if the world sees ""significantly lower interest rates, or a deterioration in geopolitics or financial market conditions,"" the council said. Lower rates typically benefit gold as it pays no interest.","Bullion is up more than 30% so far in 2024, but gains next year will likely be tempered by variables like growth and inflation.

Both countries subsequently joined the OECD.In 2021, Switzerland interpreted that when Colombia and Lithuania joined the OECD, a 5 per cent dividend rate would apply to the India-Switzerland tax treaty under the MFN clause, instead of the agreement's stated 10 per cent.Following the MFN status suspension, from January 1, 2025, Switzerland will impose a 10 per cent tax on dividends for Indian tax residents seeking Swiss withholding tax refunds and Swiss tax residents claiming foreign tax credits.The Swiss finance department officially announced the suspension of the MFN clause protocol between Switzerland and India regarding double taxation avoidance on income taxes.The Swiss authorities cited a 2023 Indian Supreme Court ruling in a case involving Vevey-based Nestle as the basis for withdrawing the MFN status.This decision means Swiss authorities will levy a 10 per cent tax on dividends earned by Indian entities in Switzerland from January 1, 2025.The statement notes that whilst the Delhi High Court supported the applicability of residual tax rates considering the MFN clause in 2021, the Indian Supreme Court reversed this on October 19, 2023, concluding that the MFN clause was not directly applicable without proper notification under Section 90 of the Income Tax Act.Nangia Andersen M&A Tax Partner Sandeep Jhunjhunwala commented that this unilateral suspension represents a significant change in bilateral treaty dynamics.He added that Indian entities in Switzerland may face increased tax obligations, highlighting the challenges of managing international tax treaties in today's global context.Jhunjhunwala emphasised the importance of treaty partners agreeing on interpretation and application of tax treaty clauses for predictability and stability.AKM Global Tax Partner, Amit Maheshwari, explained that reciprocity drove the MFN withdrawal decision, aiming for equal treatment of taxpayers in both nations.Maheshwari noted that Swiss authorities had previously announced a reduction in dividend tax rates from 10 to 5 per cent, retroactive from July 5, 2018, but the 2023 Supreme Court ruling contradicted this position.He concluded that this could affect Swiss investments in India through higher dividend withholding, and from January 1, 2025, taxation may revert to original treaty rates, disregarding the MFN clause.JSA Advocates & Solicitors Partner Kumarmanglam Vijay indicated this would particularly affect Indian companies with ODI structures involving Swiss subsidiaries, increasing Swiss dividend withholding tax from 5 to 10 per cent from January 1, 2025.",The Swiss authorities have suspended the most favoured nation status (MFN) provision in the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India.

LAS VEGAS: Amazon's cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT thrust Silicon Valley into the AI age, forcing tech giants to redraw plans and wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. ""When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,"" Jassy said at AWS's annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.""With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it's chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,"" Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS's answer to AI foundation models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS's announcements at the cloud conference.

The Nasdaq Composite Index achieved a historic milestone on Wednesday, reaching 20,000 for the first time, driven by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence and anticipated interest rate reductions that propelled technology stocks to remarkable heights.The technology-focused index has risen over 33% this year, led by major tech firms including Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and recently Tesla. The gains on Wednesday followed a US inflation report that strengthened expectations for a Federal Reserve rate reduction next week.The index concluded Wednesday's trading at 20,034.89, representing a 1.8% daily increase.The current rally has benefited investors focused on growth and technology sectors, whilst raising concerns about elevated valuations and the increasing influence of large-capitalisation stocks within the index.""There is clearly an aspect of a chase into year-end, where the winners ... keep winning,"" stated Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth.

US core inflation stays firm with fourth-straight 0.3% increase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-core-inflation-stays-firm-with-fourth-straight-0-3-increase/articleshow/116218462.cms,"File photo: Customers eat at the counter of the Lexington Candy Shop, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)

US consumer prices continued to rise in November at a pace that is fueling concerns the progress toward taming inflation is stalling.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.Traders continued to bet on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next week after the figures came in largely as expected.Follow the reaction in real time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blogEconomists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend than the overall CPI that includes often-volatile food and energy costs. The headline measure rose 0.3% from the prior month and 2.7% from a year before. Shelter costs accounted for nearly 40% of the overall advance.While price pressures have subsided from a peak seen during the pandemic recovery, progress has leveled off more recently. That, along with receding concerns over the labor market, helps explain why several US central bankers have argued for a more gradual pace of interest-rate cuts.The CPI report showed goods costs excluding food and energy climbed 0.3%, the most since May 2023 and fueled by higher prices for new and used vehicles as well as apparel. That category had been a large driver of disinflation over the past year and a half.Grocery prices jumped 0.5%, the biggest advance since the start of last year.Economists have paid close attention to shelter prices, the largest category within services and one of the most persistent sources of inflation in recent years. That metric advanced 0.3% in November after a 0.4% gain in the prior month. Owners’ equivalent rent as well as rent of primary residence — subsets of shelter — both edged up 0.2%, the smallest gains since 2021.Excluding housing and energy, service prices rose 0.3% for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the overall inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure — known as the personal consumption expenditures price index — doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI, which is one reason why it’s trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.A government report on producer prices due Thursday will offer insights into categories that feed directly into PCE, including health-care services, airfares and portfolio management.Policymakers also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed real hourly earnings grew 1.3% from a year ago.Part of the reason why Fed officials have indicated they’re in no rush to lower borrowing costs is because they no longer believe the labor market to be a source of inflation.Looking ahead, it remains to be seen to what extent President-elect Donald Trump ’s agenda will weigh on the trajectory of inflation. While consumers’ views of the economy and their finances have improved since he sealed his return to the White House, many economists say some of his campaign promises could put additional pressure on inflation. Some businesses, for example, are considering raising prices in anticipation of higher tariffs.","Core consumer price index increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.

Is Nissan's decline inevitable? Honda merger talks could hold key to survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-nissans-decline-inevitable-honda-merger-talks-could-hold-key-to-survival/articleshow/116148355.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Is a Honda merger the answer?

Nissan is grappling with a severe financial crisis that could lead to bankruptcy within the next 12 to 14 months unless decisive action is taken. The company, once a leader in the automotive industry, is now in its worst position since Carlos Ghosn's dramatic efforts in 1999 to pull it from the brink of collapse.With profits plunging by 70 per cent and a recent $60 million loss, Nissan is scrambling to find a solution to its mounting troubles, reported Forbes.In an attempt to salvage its future, Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.This includes slashing 9,000 jobs globally and selling a significant portion of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors . The company is also cutting production by 20 per cent at key US facilities in Canton, Mississippi, and Smyrna, Tennessee, which together employ over 13,000 workers.In a rare move, CEO Makoto Uchida has taken a 50 per cent pay cut to signal the urgency of the situation.Nissan’s woes can largely be attributed to its struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing automotive landscape.The company’s electric vehicle lineup is minimal, with only two models available internationally, while cheaper Chinese EV alternatives are flooding the market. Despite these challenges, there are bright spots.In the US, the locally-built Rogue SUV remains a top performer, having sold over 189,000 units through September 2024. Similarly, the Qashqai continues to dominate in Europe.However, these successes are not enough to counteract the broader decline, as per Forbes.Nissan is now searching for a lifeline, and a potential merger with Honda could be the key to its survival. The two companies recently signed a partnership focused on electric vehicle development , and some industry experts are speculating that a merger could help combine resources to overcome current financial struggles.According to the Financial Times, while this idea remains speculative, it could provide Nissan with the strength it needs to compete in the increasingly competitive global automotive market.Reacting to the report, Nissan Motor India spokesperson said, “As a policy we do not comment on speculatory reports. Nissan remains committed to its India operations, dealers, partners, and customers. We remain on track for our plan announced earlier this year at the launches of the Nissan X-TRAIL and New Nissan Magnite.”Nissan’s future remains uncertain, and time is running out. The company must make bold decisions, such as finding a major investor or merging with Honda if it hopes to avoid the fate of bankruptcy.","Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

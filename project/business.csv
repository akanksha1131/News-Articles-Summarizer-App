Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"ITR filing deadline: Don’t miss December 31, 2024 deadline for revised, belated tax returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-deadline-dont-miss-december-31-2024-deadline-for-revised-belated-tax-returns-here-are-the-consequences/articleshow/116495382.cms,"If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.

ITR filing: What are the consequences of missing the belated return filing deadline on December 31, 2024?



ITR filing: What if you miss the revised return filing December 31, 2024 deadline?

ITR filing deadline : December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Whilst various taxpayer categories have distinct ITR filing deadlines, the final date for belated and revised returns remains the same. Many individuals remain unaware of the implications of missing the December 31, 2024, submission deadline for FY 2023-24.If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.Under Section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, belated returns incur a Rs 5,000 penalty, regardless of outstanding tax amounts. A reduced penalty of Rs 1,000 applies for lower taxable income. However, individuals with income below the Rs 3 lakh basic exemption limit face no penalties.Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary of Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, told ET, ""Belated return is the last chance for the taxpayer to file the ITR and claim refunds and certain losses. If the belated return is not filed, the person misses those claims and credits for that assessment year. After the expiry of the filing of the belated return, only an updated return can be filed subject to the condition that there is a tax liability payable. Further, if no belated return is filed, the taxpayer shall have to face increased interests and penalties on the tax liabilities if a notice is sent by the income tax department.""A significant limitation of filing belated returns for FY 2023-24 is the inability to select the old tax regime , as the new regime became default from April 1, 2023. Consequently, belated returns must follow the new tax regime .Also Read | Avoid Rs 10 lakh income tax penalty! Why it's important to report foreign income, assets in ITR by December 31, 2024 - check details The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime. These provisions helped reduce taxable income and subsequent tax obligations.The new regime permits only two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) and employer NPS contributions up to 10% of basic salary. Additional benefits like Section 80C, 80D, and HRA exemptions are not applicable under the new structure.When a taxpayer needs to rectify errors in original or belated returns, they must submit a revised return. This allows corrections of various oversights, such as unreported income, unclaimed deductions, or omitted bank account details.Bhuta says, ""If the taxpayer misses the deadline to file a revised return, there is no other mechanism to file a revised return again for that assessment year and to claim refunds or losses. The income tax laws allow the filing of an updated return. However, the updated return cannot be filed in cases where the taxpayer has losses, it results in an increased refund, or the tax return has an effect of reducing the total tax liability as filed in the original or belated return. There are many other criteria as to when an updated return cannot be filed. So, if a taxpayer misses the revised return deadline, the only way in which any additional claim or credit can be requested is during the assessment proceedings. However, that is subject to litigation.""Also Read | PAN 2.0: How to easily apply for PAN Card reprint with QR code - check 6 simple steps online Whilst taxpayers can submit multiple revised returns, tax experts advise against frequent revisions as this could trigger scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.Regarding intimation notices, Bhuta explains, ""As per section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ITR can be revised only before three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of assessment, whichever event happens first. The ITR can be revised even after an intimation has been received under section 143(1). However, once the ITR is processed under a regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3), the same cannot be revised.""For the financial year 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), taxpayers have until December 31, 2024, to submit their revised returns.","December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2016, specific consequences apply.

Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating a potential reconsideration of its Indian market entry after previously suspending investment plans this year.Following a temporary pause in its Indian showroom search, Tesla has now initiated preliminary discussions with DLF regarding space in the capital region, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.According to one source, Tesla seeks 3,000 to 5,000 square feet for a customer experience centre, plus additional space triple that size for service and delivery operations.The company is considering various locations, including DLF's Avenue Mall in southern Delhi and the Cyber Hub complex in Gurugram.Earlier this year, Elon Musk indicated plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially announce a $2-3 billion investment in India. The meeting was subsequently cancelled when Tesla announced staff reductions amidst declining sales.A separate source indicated that the outcome of Tesla's discussions with India's largest property developer remains uncertain, with the company maintaining parallel discussions with other entities.Also Read | ‘Investing in India is profitable’: Putin heaps praises on PM Modi; says Russia ready to set up manufacturing operations in India The Avenue Mall, which houses international retailers like Uniqlo, Mango and Marks and Spencer, is being considered for an 8,000 square feet Tesla showroom, according to the second source.The first source emphasised that Tesla's search remains in preliminary stages without final decisions.Questions remain regarding Tesla's approach to vehicle imports, whether at the 100% tax rate or under India's new policy allowing certain EVs at 15% import duty.Following Tesla's previous unrealised investment plans, the Indian government is considering policy adjustments to attract manufacturers like Hyundai Motor and Toyota, who have shown preliminary interest.While India's EV market currently represents approximately 2% of total car sales of 4 million annually, the government aims to increase this to 30% by 2030.Tesla's showroom search coincides with Musk's Starlink considering Indian market entry.","Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi.

There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

A Bitcoin rally is fizzling in the final days of a record-breaking year for the digital asset, as investors assess the remaining impetus from President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency sector.The largest token changed hands at $96,200 as of 6 am Friday in London, partly paring a retreat of almost 3 per cent from a day earlier.

Traders are banking some of the profits sparked by the Republican’s crypto cheerleading and are waiting to see if the mooted reserve is feasible.The crypto market is also braced for the expiry of a substantial quantity of Bitcoin and Ether options contracts on Friday — one of the biggest such events in the history of digital assets, according to prime broker FalconX.The notional value of the Bitcoin contracts on the Deribit exchange — one of the largest for digital-asset derivatives — exceeds $14 billion, while the equivalent figure for Ether is about $3.8 billion.Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets, flagged the risk of a “choppy market” amid the expiry of the derivatives positions.Bitcoin is wavering even after MicroStrategy Inc. this week signaled the possibility of expanding its program of purchases of the token.

Former Suzuki Motor Chairman Osamu Suzuki dies at 94,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/former-suzuki-motor-president-chairman-ceo-osamu-suzuki-passes-away-at-94/articleshow/116709376.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Osamu Suzuki , the former President Chairman & CEO of Suzuki Motor Corporation , died aged 94 on Wednesday afternoon from malignant lymphoma , as announced by the company on Friday.PM Modi paid tribute the business tycoon calling him ""a legendary figure in the global automotive industry"". ""Deeply saddened by the passing of Mr. Osamu Suzuki, a legendary figure in the global automotive industry. His visionary work reshaped global perceptions of mobility. Under his leadership, Suzuki Motor Corporation became a global powerhouse, successfully navigating challenges, driving innovation and expansion. He had a profound affection for India and his collaboration with Maruti revolutionised the Indian automobile market,"" the PM said in post on X.Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that Suzuki's leadership, which lasted more than 40 years, transformed the Japanese automotive company into a global force, particularly establishing its market leadership in India's automotive sector.From 1978 until his retirement in 2021 at 91, Suzuki served as president, chairman, and CEO. During his tenure, Suzuki Motor's consolidated sales grew exponentially from approximately 300 billion yen (USD 1.9 billion) in 1978 to beyond 3 trillion yen in fiscal 2006.His emphasis on producing economical compact vehicles for developing markets, particularly India, distinguished the company. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, their subsidiary, secured 41.7 per cent of India's automotive market in fiscal 2023, substantially ahead of their closest competitor Hyundai Motor Co., which held 14.6 per cent.Born January 30, 1930, in Gifu Prefecture, central Japan, Osamu Suzuki joined the automotive company in 1958 following his marriage into its founding family.Osamu Suzuki took his wife Shoko's family name; she was the daughter of then-president Shunzo Suzuki. Upon becoming president in 1978, he began transforming Suzuki Motor, established in 1920 as Suzuki Loom Manufacturing Co., into a prominent Japanese automotive manufacturer.Whilst other Japanese manufacturers concentrated on American and Chinese markets, Suzuki focused on producing mini vehicles domestically and compact cars in India, Southeast Asia, and Hungary. This approach enabled the company to excel in markets prioritising cost-effectiveness and efficiency.Subsequently, under Osamu Suzuki's leadership, the company formed a capital alliance with Toyota Motor Corporation in 2019, concentrating on joint development of autonomous vehicles amid the industry's shift towards CASE (connected, autonomous, shared, and electric) technologies.Osamu Suzuki relinquished his presidential role in 2015 to his son, Toshihiro Suzuki, whilst remaining as chairman until 2021.","PM Modi paid tribute the business tycoon calling him ""a legendary figure in the global automotive industry"" From 1978 until his retirement in 2021 at 91, Suzuki served as president, chairman, and CEO.

In an era where adaptability is paramount, industries are rapidly evolving, and new professions are constantly emerging, the demand for diverse skill sets, critical knowledge, and effective communication has never been greater. A Liberal Arts education stands out as an exceptional choice to meet these challenges. It goes beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge, emphasising the cultivation of essential skills vital for thriving in today’s dynamic and globally interconnected world.Problem-solving, critical thinking, innovation and creativity, ability to collaborate and strong communication skills, along with personal traits such as emotional intelligence, curiosity, initiative, grit, and leadership are vital for adapting to the fast-paced work environment. Additionally, having socio-cultural awareness helps individuals work effectively in diverse settings. Nurturing these competencies and traits, enable better navigation of the complex modern workplace.According to the India Skills Report (2023) , the need of the hour is professionals who are highly employable and prepared for workflows, who complement knowledge with technical know-how along with professional and soft skills, and are capable of dealing with problems with a solution-oriented approach. Employers are therefore now seeking more than just academic credentials and qualifications.Whether in traditional disciplines or emerging fields, degrees provide fundamental credentials that reflect a candidate's knowledge and its practical application to the field. However, employers are increasingly looking for individuals who can effectively apply that knowledge in pragmatic, real-world scenarios, and can cut across specialisations indicating trans-functional and multi-and-interdisciplinary knowledge and skills. For this to happen, professional skills such as problem solving, teamwork, conflict resolution, networking, time management and many more, are essential 21st century competencies which need to be adapted by today's youth. Teamwork and collaboration are vital in most, if not all workplaces. The changing the need of the workforce within India has led to a new education model as envisaged in the National Education Policy ( NEP ) 20202.The Indian youth face various challenges when it comes to employability, where graduates often possess theoretical knowledge but lack practical skills expected by employers. Skill gaps exist due to a lack of focus towards practical training and experiential learning during the undergraduate programmes. The rapid technological advancements necessitate skill upgrades and learning on the go, therefore young professionals struggle to keep pace with change.These challenges highlight the critical role that educational institutions play in enhancing the employability of Indian youth. They must take the lead in bridging the gap between academic learning and the skills needed in the workforce.Liberal arts education offers a deep dive into specific areas of study to provide an in-depth understanding of the specific domain/s being pursued during the undergraduate degree.

Pioneering blockchain-based platform Rexas Finance (RXS) is positioned as a transforming agent in decentralised finance (DeFi) and real estate tokenisation. Using state-of-the-art technologies, RXS wants to tokenise real-world assets—like property—offering consumers safe, open, and quick financial services. Given the possibility of revolutionising sectors and the continuous momentum in its presale, RXS is increasingly likely to be a major contender for notable increases in the next bull run.Market analysts project that Rexas Finance's future is bright. By 2025, its price might jump to $35. Because of its original idea in real estate tokenisation, RXS leads in a niche sector with significant room for expansion. Given the worldwide real estate market, valued at over $280 trillion, even a tiny penetration might greatly benefit RXS. These metrics indicate a strong demand that will keep raising the coin's value. The most innovative aspect of Rexas Finance is that it can turn real-world assets into tokens. By turning real estate and other assets into blockchain-based tokens, RXS opens up markets with high entry barriers and inefficient processes limited to a wide range of people. People who want to invest in asset-backed cryptocurrencies, both big and small, like these benefits.Combining DeFi solutions with actual asset tokenising sets Rexas Finance apart from its rivals. Although well-known cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana have dominated the DeFi scene, their emphasis has been chiefly on innovative contract capability and dApp ecosystems. Differentiating RXS from others by stressing tokeniszing physical assets gives investors a unique value proposition and diversifies the use of blockchain technology Rexas Finance has drawn interest from investors because it is at its tenth presale stage. Selling over 374.2 million RXS tokens, the presale, priced at $0.15 in this stage, has already raised more than $32.2 million. This amazing reaction emphasizes the rising confidence and excitement in the RXS environment.Anyone without technical skills can tokenise assets on the platform with the simple Rexas Token Builder. Users of the Rexas Launchpad can also let others contribute funds for their tokens. Rexas Finance guarantees flexibility and overall fit, supporting numerous criteria, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155.Further evidence of its legitimacy comes from Rexas Finance's listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and a thorough audit by blockchain security expert Certik. This project confirms the platform's investor friendliness and dedication to community involvement. Users only visit the Rexas Finance website (rexas.com), enter their ERC20 wallet addresses, and help out in different community projects to participate. Along with encouraging community development, this strategy has attracted seasoned investors ready to seize a tremendous new prospect.The end of Rexas Finance's presale marks the next turning point, which is predicted to propel more price increases. Early investors stand to benefit greatly even before the token moves into secondary markets with an anticipated listing price of $0.20. After listing, the emphasis will go to growing its ecosystem, including institutional partners, and introducing more functions to improve user experience and utility.The platform's decentralised character guarantees security, openness, and resistance to manipulation of transactions. Since the platform will ride the bull run in 2025 and finally reach $35, this dedication to technological excellence is essential for its aim to transform financial services and democratise access to wealth-building prospects.Tokens with strong use cases, creative technology, and significant community support are set for exponential expansion during the expected crypto bull run. Rexas Finance is most likely a benefactor of the rising market trend as it checks all these aspects.Rexas Finance is a visionary project meant to transform DeFi and real estate tokenising, not just another cryptocurrency. Its strategic alliances, presale performance, and creative technologies provide a solid basis for long-term expansion. Analysts' forecasts of RXS reaching $35 by 2025 are hypothetical and based on the platform's successes and future possibilities. RXS offers a convincing possibility for investors looking for a high-potential asset in the crypto field. Rexas Finance is ready to provide transforming gains and redefine the opportunities of blockchain technology as the platform develops and the crypto market prepares for a bull run.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance Telegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance","Rexas Finance (RXS) is positioned as a transforming agent in decentralised finance (DeFi) and real estate tokenisation.

Ola Electric's Chief Technology Officer Suvonil Chatterjee Resigns Amid Leadership Shakeup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ola-electric-sees-another-high-level-departure-as-chief-technology-and-product-officer-suvonil-chatterjee-resigns-/articleshow/116697659.cms,"BENGALURU: Ola Electric Mobility lost another key management personnel with Chief Technology and Product Officer Suvonil Chatterjee calling it quits, sources familiar with the matter told TOI. Chatterjee is viewed as the second-most influential figure in the company, with the first being founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal . “It has been a while since he put his papers to Bhavish. The company held back on announcing it since they have been unable to look for a replacement,” one of the sources told TOI.The source added that the company, however, was planning to make the news public sometime this week. Aggarwal did not respond to TOI’s query on the matter. A spokesperson was not immediately available to respond to a query. “For Chatterjee to fully exit will take some time given how he is tied up across several Ola group of companies,” another source added.Chatterjee, formerly Flipkart's design lead, was Ola Electric's CTPO since 2021. He was responsible for building Ola Krutrim and Ola Maps in significant capacities – products that Aggarwal touted as disrupters to Microsoft and Google respectively earlier in the year. A BITS Pilani graduate, Chatterjee first began work with Aggarwal in 2017 as Ola's mainstay cab business' head of design. In 2021, he was promoted to chief product officer, and in 2022, he became its chief technology and product officer.Aggarwal’s co-founder at Ola and former chief technology officer Ankit Bhati quit the firm in 2019. In October this year, Ola Electric also lost another key management personnel, Pramendra Tomar, its company secretary and compliance officer, who resigned citing personal reasons and commitments. Ola Electric added that it is in the process of appointing a new candidate for the position of company secretary. The company said then that it was in the process of hiring a replacement. Sources told TOI that a replacement has not been found yet.The back-to-back resignations add to many similar instances at the company over recent years, now more so after the EV maker’s shares struggle at the stock exchanges with its price dipping below the Rs 100 mark over the months. The stock closed at Rs 93.30, down about a percent, on the NSE on Thursday.","Chief Technology and Product Officer Suvonil Chatterjee called it quits, sources familiar with the matter told TOI.

In addition to unsecured loans, RBI has also raised concerns about top-up loans on gold loans, stating they could present similar risks to unsecured loans. RBI noted that these loans ""could lead to a buildup of risks, especially during times when collateral for such loans becomes volatile or faces cyclical downturns.""In light of these concerns, RBI had instructed that all top-up loans extended by regulated entities (REs) against movable assets - which are inherently depreciating in nature - should be treated as unsecured loans for credit appraisal, prudential limits, and exposure purposes.Another area of concern for RBI is private credit. Acknowledging the trend of shifting from formal lenders to private credit, RBI said, ""A closer look is, however, warranted at the interlinkages between regulated entities, including banks and NBFCs, and such firms.

Canada Flagpoling Ban: Canada flagpoling policy 2024: Canada Ends Flagpoling for Work and Study Permits: Key Implications Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-ends-flagpoling-for-work-and-study-permits-what-it-means/articleshow/116657872.cms,"Representative image

Reasons behind ban

Limited exemptions

Citizens or permanent residents of the United States.

Professionals and technicians under free trade agreements with countries such as the United States, Mexico, Chile, Panama, Peru, Colombia, and South Korea.

Spouses or common-law partners of professionals under these agreements.

International truck drivers leaving Canada for work who held maintained status due to a timely renewal application.

Individuals with pre-existing CBSA appointments for permit processing.

Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) instead of re-entering Canada after briefly leaving for expedited immigration services, according to a statement by the Canada Border Services Agency .Flagpoling has long been used by temporary residents to bypass typical processing wait times for work and study permits. However, Canadian authorities now aim to streamline port operations and enhance border enforcement.“This change will enable us to further streamline activities at our ports of entry and allow Canadian and American border officers to focus on what they have been expertly trained to do – border enforcement,” public safety minister David McGuinty said in a statement, reported CBC News.Flagpoling has placed a significant burden on Canadian and American border services. Between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, the CBSA processed over 69,300 flagpolers, primarily in regions like the Pacific, southern Ontario, and Quebec, according to CIC News.The CBSA emphasised that border services are intended for individuals entering Canada rather than those already in the country. Diverting resources for flagpolers has added congestion and hindered critical border enforcement activities.“A strong Canada-US relationship keeps people and goods moving safely while protecting both sides of the border,” immigration minister Marc Miller said, adding that the policy shift would enhance fairness, ease border congestion, and improve overall border efficiency.Certain groups will still qualify for port-of-entry processing under specific circumstances:Those who attempt to flagpole without meeting these criteria will be redirected to IRCC for their applications.The policy is likely part of a broader initiative to bolster Canada-US border security . The Liberal government's fall economic update allocated $1.3 billion over six years for measures like drones, helicopters, and improved monitoring of the shared border. The changes also come amid concerns over potential US tariffs.Flagpoling, once a viable option for expediting permits, is now phased out to prioritize border security and efficient management. Applicants are being urged to use IRCC’s online services for work or study permit renewals moving forward.","Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

Renewed calls for transparency

Spy chiefs allegedly silenced US defense department and FBI researchers who uncovered evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab, sources told The Post. These findings were excluded from an August 2021 report presented to President Joe Biden, which concluded the virus was ""probably not genetically engineered.""Three scientists—John Hardham, Robert Cutlip, and Jean-Paul Chretien—investigated the origins of Covid-19 and uncovered compelling data favoring the lab leak theory, including:Despite the findings, intelligence officials excluded them from the report to Biden and barred the researchers from sharing their analysis with Congress or the FBI, the latter being the only agency to conclude with confidence that a lab leak was the likely origin.“The scientists with subject matter expertise were silenced,” a source familiar with the investigation claimed, adding that Biden and senior officials were unaware of the withheld evidence. Additionally, federal grant documents detailing a “blueprint” for engineering viruses like SARS-CoV-2 were improperly classified, according to whistleblower Lt. Col. Joseph Murphy.FBI scientist Jason Bannan, whose team supported the lab leak theory, criticized the lack of transparency in the intelligence community’s findings. “What ended up on the cutting-room floor needs to be re-examined,” Bannan told The Wall Street Journal.The suppressed findings have reignited demands for a deeper probe into Covid-19’s origins, as the virus has claimed over 1.2 million American lives since 2019.","Spy chiefs allegedly silenced US defense department and FBI researchers who uncovered evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai on Friday whipped himself several times as a mark of protest accusing the DMK government of failing to protect the students of Anna University in Chennai.Annamalai accused the DMK government and police of leaking the victim's personal details and compromising her dignity, calling it a “shameful” act that reflected the administration’s incompetence.The BJP leader, who announced on Thursday that he would forego wearing footwear until the DMK is ousted from power, criticised the lack of CCTV surveillance at the university and questioned the state’s use of the Nirbhaya fund meant for women’s safety.“The FIR itself has exposed the victim’s identity and portrayed her in a poor light. This is a disgrace, and the DMK government must take responsibility,” he said, slamming law minister S Regupathy for defending the state’s actions.Annamalai also lambasted the police for their role in mishandling the case and demanded the removal of the Chennai police commissioner or the deputy commissioner involved. Declaring an end to public protests that often result in arrests, he urged BJP cadres to stage demonstrations at their homes.The BJP chief further announced plans to observe a 48-day fast and visit the six Arupadai Veedu (Lord Muruga’s six abodes) to “complain to Murugan” about the state’s deteriorating governance.“This kind of dirty politics leaves no room for respect or healthy debate.

American Airlines Group Inc said a technical vendor glitch was the cause of a brief groundstop on all US flights on Christmas Eve, one of the busiest days of the holiday travel season.

Nippon Steel Corp’s proposed $12.3 billion acquisition of US Steel Corp. moved a step closer to being blocked after a US national security panel deadlocked on its review and left the final decision with President Biden, who has repeatedly indicated his opposition to the deal.

Salesforce Inc says it’s taking multiple large customers from former partner Veeva Systems Inc. in a mounting rivalry to sell software to the pharmaceutical industry.

A Starbucks Corp barista strike has shut down about 170 cafes, according to the coffee chain, disrupting service at locations nationwide during the final days of the crucial holiday shopping season.

The Nasdaq 100 rose 1.4%

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%

The MSCI World Index rose 0.9%

Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index rose 2.1%

The Russell 2000 Index rose 1%

A rally in the group that has led Wall Street ’s gains in 2024 lifted stocks in a relatively quiet session ahead of Christmas.Following a strong day for big tech, the shares continued to power ahead on Tuesday. Tesla Inc. led megacaps higher. Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. climbed as President Joe Biden’s team launched a probe into Chinese-made chips. In a shortened pre-holiday session, the S&P 500“The action of the past few weeks shows that the big-cap tech names are still the key leadership group in today’s stock market,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “These big-tech names are highly overweighted in the portfolios of a huge number of institutional investors. Any buying they do over the next week is likely to be concentrated in these names.”Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year and the first two of the new one. This time around that window started Tuesday.“Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year,” said London Stockton at Ned Davis Research.Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated average and median returns of 1.3% during this period, widely outpacing the market’s average seven-day gain of 0.3%, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.“When investors are on the ‘nice’ list, and Santa delivers a ‘positive’ Santa Claus Rally return, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.59%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index barely budged.While a positive “Santa Claus Rally” has preceded a 10.4% average annual gain for the S&P 500 since World War II, Sam Stovall at CFRA says a more accurate indicator in his view is the “January Barometer.”That’s a market hypothesis positing that January’s performance predicts the year’s performance. The term was coined by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, in 1972.Since 1945, when the year started with a gain in January, the S&P 500 rose an average of 18.3% in price during the entire year, Stovall at CFRA said. If the first month saw a decline in price, however, the average full-year return was negative 1.9%.With the market up over 25% this year and no corrections of more than 10%, the S&P 500 has managed to stay solidly above its 200-day moving average for the entirety of 2024, noted Bespoke Investment Group strategists.“Barring a significant market selloff in the last few trading days of the year, this will be the 12th year since 1952 (when we went to the current 5-day trading week at the NYSE) that the S&P has traded above its 200-DMA all year,” they said.The average next-year change following these years has been a gain of just 4.6% compared to the average gain of 9.2% for all years, Bespoke noted.Last week, Bank of America Corp. clients were large net buyers of US equities, according to strategist Jill Carey Hall. They bought American shares for the seventh consecutive week.Similar to the prior five weeks, clients bought both single stocks and exchange-traded funds, with bigger inflows into the former, she noted. Flows were primarily in large caps.Investors should have a more-balanced approach in US stocks over the first quarter, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Scott Chronert, who see a greater opportunity in defensive sectors.They raised health care to overweight, noting valuations are now lower and fundamentals seem close to inflection point. Meantime, they are selective on growth stocks, looking for stronger fundamental trend versus valuation and potential margin improvement.Citi’s strategists are overweight in media, internet and semiconductors, while raising software to market weight.",The S&P 500 rose 1.1%.

The battle of the top performing L1 blockchains has been pretty wild this year, with the likes of ETH, SOL, TRX, BNB, Toncoin (TON) and Cardano (ADA) fighting to claim the leadership mantle. However, out of all these networks, TON blockchain is showing huge promise as it records approximately 200% gains.Conversely, Cardano network is also making waves, especially as its new Hydra scalability solution is set to potentially unlock 1 million TPS. On the other hand, predictions about a fast-rising presale star– Lunex Network (LNEX) are blowing up as it shows the potential of overthrowing TON and ADA in 2025.Over the past year and counting, TON blockchain has been widely popular for one major thing— blockchain lucrative games. The partnership between Toncoin and Telegram to bring mini-games to millions of users was a very profitable one.From launching several tap-to-earn games to furthering its expansion in P2E games, Toncoin has been able to rack up approximately 200% NET gains . As experts rank Toncoin (TON) alongside cryptos to buy , analysts are starting to give bullish predictions.Although TON price is currently down by 11% as it trades within a weekly range of $6.6 and $5.9, the network is still receiving positive sentiment. X aanalyst, Crypto King particularly sighted a short term prediction of $10 for Toncoin. While this may seem far-fetched from the current price, the token’s 50, 100, and 200 moving averages points at a strong buy.Since its founder, Charles Hoskinson met up with President Donald Trump for the sake of enhancing crypto adoption, Cardano has been buzzing alongside other DeFi coins . Cardano price now sits at a weekly range of $$0.98 and $1.28, 70% jump from its price in the past month. However experts believe this is just the starting.During a recent Cardano market dip, whales took the opportunity to accumulate 130 million ADA token, signaling huge bullish sentiment and strong confidence. Owing to this several investors are positive for Cardano network.Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst and expert has sparked more optimism recently. In a very recent tweet. Ali emphasized on how he will keep buying ADA even if it dips to $0.7 as he expects a further surge to $4 or $6 for Cardano.As a fast, secure and non-custodial DeFi project with robust features to facilitate effortless cross chain transactions, it won’t be surprising for Lunex Network (LNEX) to challenge top DeFi coins. The new altcoin project has already accumulated over $5.4 million in revenue after selling over 2.3 billion of its presale supply. Such buying interest only speaks of its potential to deliver immeasurable returns when it launches on DEX platforms.However, asides the numbers, Lunex Network has more growth potential embedded in its ecosystem and practical use. For starters, the platform allows investors to swap up to 50,000 cryptocurrencies across multi chains by connecting isolated blockchains together. Additionally, users can invest in its LNEX tokens and earn up to 18% APY in passive income when they engage in its staking pool.Furthermore, there’s a reward system where the platform gives half of its revenue to users while preserving the other half for more exclusive rewards. Alongside this, Lunex Network helps investors track their portfolio while delivering updated market insights. The platform also grants cashback rewards on every transaction, allowing users to earn more by actively using the network. With over 300% spike, its LNEX token is now valued at $0.0048 from an initial $0.0012.The practical uses and diversity that Lunex Network brings as an exchange platform is enough to contend with the likes of Toncoin. Although TON has seen huge developments as a mothering network to several other cryptocurrencies, Lunex Network’s intricate design catered for crypto investors, business owners and Web3 development makes it stand out as a tough contender. This put LNEX token on the radar of top cryptos to buy.You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:Website: https://lunexnetwork.com Socials: https://linktr.ee/lunexnetwork","Lunex Network (LNEX) is primed for a staggering growth above most DeFi coins.

Together, they would achieve sufficient scale to compete against Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG. Toyota maintains technological partnerships with Japanese firms Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.Honda's chief executive, Toshihiro Mibe, indicated that both companies would seek to consolidate their operations under a shared holding structure, with Honda initially directing the new management while maintaining individual company identities and brands. They plans to finalise a merger agreement by June and complete the transaction, including listing the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, by August 2026.Japanese automotive manufacturers have fallen behind major competitors in electric vehicle development and are seeking cost reductions while attempting to recover lost ground.Earlier this month, speculation emerged about potential collaboration, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that discussions were partially influenced by Taiwan's Foxconn's interest in acquiring Renault SA's Nissan shares.Meanwhile, Nissan's chief executive Makoto Uchida confirmed no direct communication from Foxconn, while acknowledging Nissan's ""severe"" circumstances.However, even after merger, Toyota will remain Japan's dominant automotive manufacturer, having produced 11.5 million vehicles in 2023. The three combining companies would collectively manufacture approximately 8 million vehicles. During 2023, Honda manufactured 4 million units, Nissan 3.4 million, and Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.Earlier in August, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced their intention to join hands on electric vehicle components and autonomous driving software research, following an initial agreement between Nissan and Honda in March.Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions said that Honda could benefit from Nissan's truck-based SUVs like the Armada and Infiniti QX80, while gaining from Nissan's expertise in battery technology, electric vehicles and hybrid powertrains.Earlier, Nissan announced layoffs affecting 9,000 staff globally in November, alongside a 20% reduction in production capacity, after reporting losses of 9.3 billion yen.

Google proposes fix to solve search monopoly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/google-proposes-fix-to-solve-search-monopoly/articleshow/116551583.cms,"WASHINGTON: Google said Friday what it thought should change to address a ruling that it had illegally maintained a monopoly over online search: not much.It follows the landmark ruling in Aug by judge Amit P Mehta of the US district court for the district of Columbia, who said Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple and Samsung to be the search engine that automatically appears when users open a web browser or a smartphone. The govt then asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular browser, among other remedies.In Google's own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement. But it said those agreements should be less restrictive than in the past.Apple, for example, could select different search engines to come up automatically for iPhone and iPad users, said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's VP of regulatory affairs, in a blog post. Cellphone makers using Google's popular operating system, Android, could also install multiple search engines and could install other Google apps without installing its search tool or its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant product.""We don't propose these changes lightly,"" she said.

Britannica didn't just survive. It's an AI company now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/britannica-didnt-just-survive-its-an-ai-company-now/articleshow/116551465.cms,"For nearly 250 years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a bookshelf-busting series of gilt-lettered tomes, often purchased to show that its owners cared about knowledge. It was the sort of physical media expected to die in the internet era, and indeed, the encyclopedia's publisher announced that it was ending the print edition in 2012. Skeptics wondered how Britannica the company could survive in the age of Wikipedia. The answer was to adapt to the times.Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries. It also sells artificial intelligence agent software that underpins apps like customer service chatbots and data retrieval.Britannica has figured out not only how to survive, but also how to do well financially. Jorge Cauz, its CEO, said in an interview that the publisher enjoyed pro forma profit margins of about 45%.The company is weighing an initial public offering, in which it could seek a valuation of about $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations.That could provide a sizable return for the company's owner, Swiss financier Jacob E Safra, who acquired the publisher in 1995 and, in a lawsuit filed in 2022, cited an investment bank in valuing Britannica at $500 million. The company says its websites draw over 7 billion annual page views a year, with users in more than 150 countries.Britannica has come far from its origins in the 18th century as the publisher of a reference work put together by three Scottish printers. Over the years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica became a heavyweight of the knowledge business, both literally - the 32-volume 2010 edition, the last to run in print, weighed 129 pounds - and figuratively, drawing on contributions from thousands of experts. It also became an aspirational status symbol, with customers paying nearly $1,400 for that edition.By the time the last Encyclopaedia Britannica was printed, the company had already started its suite of websites and educational software. Now it sees even greater opportunity in the growth of generative AI tools , which the company says can help make learning more dynamic - and therefore more desirable.Cauz said Britannica had experimented with the technology over the past few decades. It acquired Melingo, the company that makes its AI agent software, in 2000 because of its strength in natural language processing and machine learning. And it has two technology teams, based in Chicago and in Tel Aviv.The vertiginous popularity of chatbots like ChatGPT convinced executives that they needed to invest more in the space. Britannica now uses AI in creating, fact-checking and translating content for its products, including the online encyclopedia. It also created a Britannica chatbot that draws on its online encyclopedia's stores of information, which Cauz said was more likely to be accurate than the more generalised chatbots that could be prone to ""hallucinations.""The firm has more projects powered by generative AI in the pipeline: an English-language tutoring software that will use the tech to power avatars and customise lessons for each student, a program to help teachers create lesson plans, and a revamped thesaurus for the Merriam-Webster website that can handle phrases, not just words.","Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam- Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries.

Bond yields climb, stock market feels the squeeze

Winners and losers on Wall Street

Global markets and economic uncertainty

Economic outlook clouds amid inflation and political shifts

US stock markets endured one of their most severe declines of the year on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled a shift in its monetary policy trajectory. The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,123 points, or 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite suffered the worst drop, declining 3.6%.The central bank announced its third rate cut of the year, lowering its main interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, it was the Fed’s updated projections for 2025 that rattled investors: Policymakers now anticipate only two additional cuts next year, down from four projected just three months ago.“We are in a new phase of the process,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, explaining the tempered outlook as a response to robust job market performance, rising inflation readings, and economic uncertainties, including the upcoming Trump administration’s policies.Treasury yields surged following the Fed's announcement, exerting additional pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40%, while the two-year yield, more sensitive to Fed actions, increased to 4.35% from 4.25%.Higher yields typically hurt stock valuations, particularly for companies reliant on borrowing to drive growth. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 4.4%, reflecting the acute impact of rising interest rates on smaller-cap stocks.“We’re seeing the market recalibrate for a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. “The Fed’s announcement caught investors off guard, eroding confidence in the expected pace of rate reductions.”Among individual stocks, General Mills fell 3.1% despite better-than-expected quarterly profits, as its lowered profit forecast for the year spooked investors. Nvidia, a significant driver of this year’s market rally, dropped 1.1%, extending its losses to over 13% since its record high last month.Conversely, Jabil surged 7.3% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raising its full-year revenue forecast.Global markets displayed mixed reactions. In London, the FTSE 100 rose marginally by less than 0.1%, buoyed by data showing UK inflation at an eight-month high. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged when it announces its decision on Thursday.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%, even as Nissan shares jumped 23.7% on reports of potential collaboration with Honda. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors, partly owned by Nissan, saw its shares soar nearly 20%.Powell noted that while rate cuts could stimulate economic growth, they also risk exacerbating inflation. “When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,” he said, likening the Fed’s approach to navigating a foggy night.Lingering inflationary pressures and the transition to the Trump administration have introduced additional variables into the Fed’s calculus. Powell acknowledged that some officials are already weighing the implications of potential fiscal policy changes, including tariffs and spending initiatives.Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack was the lone dissenter in Wednesday’s decision, arguing against the rate cut.As Wall Street digests the Fed’s outlook, concerns grow that the anticipated “Santa Claus rally” may be replaced by further volatility, with analysts suggesting that traders may lock in profits amid uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

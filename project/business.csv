Stock market today: Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened in green on Thursday but closed in red after a sharp decline in the last two trading sessions. While Nifty50 was at 24,430, BSE Sensex was down over 270 points. At closing, i.e. 3.30 pm, Nifty50 settled at 24,426.85, down 74.05 points or 0.30%. BSE Sensex was at 79,809.65, down 270.92 points or 0.34%.Market experts indicate that supportive measures including GST reforms, import duty adjustments and the 'Swadeshi' initiative are anticipated to provide stability to domestic markets despite international trade challenges.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “A significant takeaway from the market trend yesterday is that despite the big buying of Rs 6920 crores by DIIs, overwhelming the FII selling of Rs 3856 crores, Nifty drifted down by 211 points. The reason for this important market trend is the increasing short build up by the FIIs. The negative sentiments in the market triggered by the 50% Trump tariff and the high valuations in India has encouraged the FIIs to increase their short positions. September series historically has been known for big moves. A quick decision on the tariff policy can lead to reversal of sentiments and short covering. We don’t know whether this will happen.“The policy initiatives in India - the fiscal stimulus through the Budget, monetary stimulus through rate cuts and the coming GST rationalisation- should revive economic growth and corporate earnings in India in the coming quarters. That is when we will have a fundamentally supported rally in the market. Investors can utilise the dips in the market to buy fairly-valued stocks and wait patiently in anticipation of the rally.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark Indices witnessed sharp decline during last week, with Nifty closing the August month expiry around 24,500 levels. Investors are closely tracking the government’s fiscal and policy interventions, with emphasis on potential GST rationalization and sectoral stimulus packages aimed at alleviating tariff-induced headwinds and reinforcing the broader growth trajectory. US has enforced a steep 50% tariff on Indian imports from August 27, 2025, India stands at a pivotal juncture, testing both its economic resilience and diplomatic agility.Going ahead to pause the current down move index needs to close above previous sessions high, failing to do so will keep the bias down.Nifty has an immediate support base placed at 24,400-24,350 levels being the confluence of the recent lows and the key retracement area. Index holding above the same will lead to a consolidation in the range of 24,400-24,900. While failure to do so will signal acceleration of decline towards 24,000-23,800 levels being the confluence of the 52 weeks EMA and the previous major lows and the previous major breakout area.On the higher side resistance is seen around 24,900 levels. Only a move above the same will signal a pause in the downtrend. While a move above 24,900 will extend pullback towards the major resistance area of 25150-25,250 levels being the confluence of the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline and the previous swing high.We expect volatility to pick up tracking tariff development and GDP numbers. Hence, focus should be on accumulating quality stocks backed by strong earnings, especially those poised to benefit from next-generation GST reforms and upcoming festive season.Bank Nifty formed a sizable bear candle with a lower high and lower low signaling continuation of the corrective decline as the index closed below the 100 days EMA. Index in the process closed below the last 3 weeks range (54,900-56,100) highlighting extension of the decline.Going ahead, failure to move above 55,000 will keep the bias down and will open downside towards 53,500- 53,000 levels in the coming sessions.Key support is placed at 53,000 levels being the confluence of the 200 days EMA and the low of May 2025.The stock has recently generated a breakout above the consolidation range (210-165) with strong volume signaling resumption of up move and higher participation at the breakout area thus offering fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to extend up move and head towards 257 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the range breakout.The weekly stochastic remains in a strong up trend forming higher high and higher low thus supports the positive bias in the stock.The stock has recently generated a breakout above the bullish rounding formation signaling continuation of the up trend and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock has outperformed the overall market and is likely to extend its current outperformance.We expect the stock to head towards 270 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the rounding formation. Weekly MACD remains in a strong up trend thus supports the positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Godawari Power and Ispat Limited and Apollo Micro Systems are the top stock picks for today.

Some countries pressured us to open agriculture market; but India now stands tall: Agri minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/some-countries-pressured-us-to-open-agriculture-market-but-india-now-stands-tall-agri-minister-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/123605350.cms,"



Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday said some countries had earlier pressured India to open its agricultural market, but the nation stands tall today and engages on the global stage with confidence. Without naming the United States, he drew a contrast between India’s past dependence on imported wheat and its current record harvests.“Some countries were pressuring us to fully open the agricultural market, but today we can proudly say India is in a position to speak to the world with its chin up (in an assertive manner),” PTI quoted him as saying while addressing a symposium on advanced farming in Vidisha, his Lok Sabha constituency.The minister recalled that there was a time when India was “forced to consume low-quality PL-480 wheat from the United States.” He added: “But today, our food reserves are abundant. India achieved record 3.7 per cent growth in agriculture this year, resulting in record production of wheat, rice and maize, which has filled the nation’s food reserves to the brim.”Chouhan said attempts to impose tariffs on India were expected to disrupt the economy, but the country registered the highest GDP growth in just three months, with agriculture as the largest contributor.India’s GDP grew 7.8 per cent in the April-June quarter of the current fiscal, the highest in five quarters before the imposition of heavy tariff by the United States, he noted.He emphasised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stance that “national interest is paramount” and that farmers’ interests would not be compromised. Chouhan also underlined the need to increase output while reducing costs.Outlining a six-pronged strategy for farmers, he listed higher production, lower costs, fair pricing, loss compensation, crop diversification, and promotion of natural farming. He urged farmers to adopt diversification practices rooted in traditional methods.Chouhan said the government has deployed 2,170 scientific teams directly to farmers’ fields. “For the upcoming Rabi season, scientific teams will visit farms from October 3 to share knowledge on new techniques and advanced cultivation methods, aiming to raise productivity and lower costs,” he said.He flagged concerns over the misuse of agricultural inputs, noting that dealers earlier forced farmers to buy pesticides or fertilisers without proper checks. He pointed out that nearly 30,000 bio-stimulant products were once sold without scientific testing.“But now only those validated by ICAR or agricultural universities will be available. Selling ineffective or fake products will lead to FIRs, licence cancellations for companies and compensation to farmers,” Chouhan said.Urging citizens to adopt swadeshi practices, he appealed to people to buy domestically produced clothing, food and daily essentials to support local employment and commerce rather than spend on foreign products.","Shivraj Singh Chouhan drew a contrast between India’s past dependence on imported wheat and its current record harvests.

Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra on Saturday said India is poised to become the world’s third largest economy soon, crediting the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana for strengthening growth and financial inclusion.Speaking at Santripti Shivir, a financial inclusion campaign by government banks in Rangwasa village, Malhotra said the Union government and the RBI had launched the Jan Dhan Yojana 11 years ago in collaboration with banks, paving the way for development across the country, PTI reported.“Today, India is counted among the five most developed countries in the world and very soon the country will become the third largest economy,” Malhotra said.He pointed out that over 55 crore accounts have been opened under the scheme to ensure participation of people from all sections in the country’s growth journey, providing them with savings, pensions, insurance, credit and other services.Malhotra stressed the importance of account holders updating their details under the Know Your Customer (KYC) process to prevent misuse of accounts or their turning into ‘mule accounts’ used by criminals to launder illicit funds.The governor also urged people to improve their digital literacy and financial awareness to protect themselves from frauds while encouraging wider use of UPI and digital banking.Expressing satisfaction over women’s significant participation in the financial inclusion drive, Malhotra said they are playing a key role in India’s development.He noted that banking services are now available through branches or business correspondents within a radius of 5 kilometres of almost all villages in the country.The Centre and the RBI, along with banks, had launched a nationwide financial inclusion campaign on July 1, which will run till September 30. The campaign includes opening new Jan Dhan accounts, enrolling people under social security schemes, and completing KYC processes.Malhotra urged banks to accelerate the drive with support from government employees and public representatives, stressing that “a long journey still lies ahead in achieving the goals of this mission.”State Bank of India Chairman C S Setty was also present at the event.",Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra said India is poised to become the world’s third largest economy soon.

"India charts strategy to soften 50% US tariff on exports, govt working overtime with stakeholders: CEA Anantha Nageswaran",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-charts-strategy-to-soften-50-us-tariff-on-exports-govt-working-overtime-with-stakeholders-cea-anantha-nageswaran/articleshow/123606220.cms,"



Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Anantha Nageswaran on Saturday said the government, along with various stakeholders, is working overtime to cushion India’s export sector from the impact of the 25% additional tariff imposed by the United States, which has raised the overall duty to 50%.Speaking virtually at an event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, he said crises, whether minor or major, often act as catalysts for action by the government, private sector and households, PTI reported. Since the US tariffs took effect on August 27, “conversations have been happening in the last three to four days” involving exporting bodies, promotion agencies and ministries, he added.The Ministry of Finance and other ministries are “working overtime” to frame a strategy that would provide both a “time cushion” and a “financial cushion” so affected sectors can “weather the present storm and also emerge stronger,” Nageswaran said. He also noted that a proposed agreement with the US, negotiated “in good faith” and nearly concluded, had been delayed due to “unexpected developments,” though not denied.The CEA also referred to India facing a penal tariff for buying Russian crude oil, which the Ministry of External Affairs has described as unreasonable. He expressed hope that the tariffs would be “short-lived” and that “an understanding of the importance of the larger dimensions of the India-US relationship will eventually prevail.”Highlighting “silver linings,” Nageswaran pointed out that India’s real GDP grew 7.8% year-on-year in Q1, while nominal GDP rose 8.8%, above private economists’ estimates. He attributed the lower nominal growth compared to earlier quarters to “good deflation,” driven by easing input costs such as crude oil and industrial metals, even as enterprises retained pricing power.The manufacturing sector’s Gross Value Added rose 10.1% in nominal terms and 7.7% in real terms, reflecting resilience. He said this underpins optimism that full-year nominal GDP growth will stay near the 10.1% assumed in the Union Budget.Nageswaran flagged that the “huge tax cut” for households with annual income up to Rs 26.7 lakh, announced in February, is already showing in higher advance tax payments. Further relief is expected through GST rationalisation and simplification.He also pointed to the new employment-linked incentive scheme, which rewards both employers and employees, calling it crucial to balance job creation with competitiveness in the AI era.On the global front, the CEA underlined India’s credit rating upgrade by Standard & Poor’s — the first in 30 years — and expressed confidence that Fitch may follow. He stressed that fiscal prudence, with the deficit brought down to 4.4% this year from 9.2% in 2021, has reduced borrowing costs and the private sector’s cost of capital by three percentage points over the last decade.Nageswaran said India is actively diversifying trade ties through FTAs with the UAE and UK, and ongoing talks with Oman and Bahrain, some of which could materialise before year-end. Calling the current situation an opportunity, he urged industry to diversify export markets, invest in R&D and product innovation, and improve practices to stay competitive.“Each one of us has an obligation to ourselves, society, our employees and our customers to use this opportunity to improve the way we do business and strive for innovation and excellence,” he said.He added that the government will double down on deregulation, ease of doing business and job creation while engaging with the US to resolve the tariff issue.","Anantha Nageswaran said the government, along with various stakeholders, is working overtime to cushion India’s export sector from the impact of the 25% additional tariff imposed by the United States.

NEW DELHI: Non-government organisation Forum for Trade Justice on Saturday cautioned that extending concessions to the US in the agri and dairy sectors under a trade pact would have long-term disruptive impacts on local farmers.US demands in free trade agreement negotiations will mean that a foreign country forces changes in India's policies, regulations, and laws, overriding India's sovereignty, the organisation said in an open letter.The Trump administration has currently slapped a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports to the US, on both economic and political grounds and has apparently demanded duty-free access to Indian markets in return for a reduction of these illegal tariffs, it said.""These concessions would have large-scale and long-term disruptive impacts on both Indian farmers and India's agro-biodiversity,"" it added.It also said that in respect of intellectual property (IP), India may be compelled to make changes to its domestic patent laws for facilitating ""evergreening"" of patents on pharmaceutical products.""This would destroy India's generic medicine industry, thereby resulting in a sharp increase in the cost of healthcare among the sick and poor,"" it said.Forum for Trade Justice is a network of organisations working in the area of global trade, including farmers' associations, trade unions, traders' groups, health associations, environmental groups, and activists in various areas.","Non-government organisation Forum for Trade Justice cautioned that extending concessions to the US in the agri and dairy sectors under a trade pact would have long-term disruptive impacts on local farmers.

NEW DELHI: With just two days to go before the Supreme Court hears a PIL regarding the usage of E20 fuel and its negative impact on fuel efficiency and engine health of older vehicles, the auto industry, fuel companies and testing agency ARAI came out in full strength to defend the measure – surprisingly over the weekend -- dismissing public concerns around blending fuel with 20% ethanol as “hearsay, misinformation, and misunderstanding”.The industry bodies claimed that “not one case has come up of a vehicle breakdown” due to the usage of E20 fuel, and insisted that drop in fuel efficiency was “marginal”. They further added that the decline in efficiency could be a result of poor maintenance of vehicles, bad driving habits, or older age of the model.The meeting had representatives from top companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto, TVS, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI), oil marketing companies, and Automotive Research Association of India.The companies, however, assured that they will work out a mechanism to ensure that dealers and workshops honour the warranty given to vehicles in case a damage happens to older engines due to 20% ethanol blended fuel.The E20 blending of fuel has led to a furore across social media platforms as people complain about a drop in mileage of vehicles, adverse impact on engines and their performance, and reduction in torque.This had led to filing of a PIL in the top court which will be heard on Monday by a bench headed by Chief Justice BR Gavai.However, most of the queries raised by the media remained unanswered, including details about how many vehicles which are currently plying on the road (two-wheelers and four-wheelers etc.) are non-compliant with E20 fuels because of being from the previous generation.The industry officials, which included ARAI Director Reji Mathai, Toyota VP Vikram Gulati, Maruti Executive Committee Member CV Raman, and FIPI Director PS Ravi, defended the higher blending with ethanol. They argued that while resulting in a “marginal” decline in mileage, E20 helps in lowering vehicular emissions, reducing the level of oil imports and resultant foreign currency outgo, and increasing the income of farmers.The industry also defended the decision to not share reports and studies of ARAI over the impact of E20 fuel on a vehicle’s performance or mileage, saying it may reveal certain internal data of companies.",The E20 blending of fuel has led to a furore across social media platforms as people complain about a drop in mileage of vehicles.

Cost advantage and mass-market play

Safety and smart features





BENGALURU: Electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy on Friday introduced a new product platform, dubbed EL, aimed at improving manufacturing efficiency and enabling the company to target India’s cost-sensitive mass-market segment more competitively.The EL platform, announced at Ather’s first Community Day event since it went public this year, will be the basis for a future lineup of scooters built out of the company’s upcoming plant in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (formerly Aurangabad).While the new plant is yet to begin assembly, Ather CEO and cofounder Tarun Mehta told TOI that the EL architecture will reduce production man-hours by 15%, thanks to a simplified chassis, electronics consolidation and fewer components.Although absolute headcount is expected to increase with higher volumes, Mehta clarified that “overall manpower will go up, but on a percentage basis, (it will be) lesser” due to efficiency gains from EL.As reported earlier, Ather’s net loss narrowed to Rs 178.2 crore in the first quarter ended June 2025, from Rs 182.9 crore a year earlier. Revenue had risen 83% year-on-year to Rs 672.9 crore, while volumes nearly doubled to 46,078 units.The company had attributed margin improvement to cost down-cycles in battery packs and vehicle electronics, as well as multiple ongoing R&D initiatives.Ather, which has so far competed in the Rs 1 lakh and above price segments with models like the 450X and Rizta, has not had a presence in the sub-Rs 1 lakh electric scooter segment. That price bracket has become highly competitive with rivals such as Ola Electric, TVS iQube, Hero Vida, and Bajaj Chetak racing to gain share among budget-conscious consumers.Ather is now betting that the EL platform, with its modular design and reduced cost base, will enable it to launch more affordable products over time. “The platform gives us the flexibility to build a wide variety of form factors by reusing a common set of components,” the company said in its press statement. It added that the design has been developed based on 26 lakh kilometres of field data.Among technical upgrades, Ather said EL will support a longer service interval of up to 10,000 km, and allow twice-as-fast periodic servicing. It also features an integrated motor controller and onboard charger that removes the need for a separate portable unit.The new platform introduces Advanced Electronic Braking System (AEBS) to reduce stopping distance and minimize rear-wheel lockups. It will also support Pothole Alerts and Crash Alerts, two new safety features that rely on fleet-wide scooter data. While pothole detection triggers voice warnings about bad patches of road, the crash detection feature can notify emergency contacts with live location if a serious accident is detected.Separately, Ather also announced AtherStack 7.0, the latest version of its proprietary operating system for scooters, which introduces voice commands and AI-driven contextual updates. Other additions include Infinite Cruise, a new cruise control suite tailored to Indian road conditions.","Ather Energy has introduced a new product platform, dubbed EL, aimed at improving manufacturing efficiency.

The use of 20 per cent ethanol-blended petrol (E20) in vehicles could result in a minor decline of 2-4 per cent in fuel efficiency, but the overall benefits to the nation far outweigh the marginal extra fuel cost for consumers, industry officials and the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) said on Saturday.Auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) maintained that concerns over fuel-related warranty or insurance claims are “misplaced,” with manufacturers committed to honouring warranties “without any ifs and buts.”“The mileage-related challenges, there is admittance, clearly, that due to the intrinsic nature of the fuel there is marginal drop, but it accrues the huge benefit to the nation, to the society, to the farmer, to the environment, to the exchequer and all of us,” SIAM Executive Director P K Banerjee said, PTI quoted.Banerjee rejected consumer claims that efficiency had fallen by as much as 20-50 per cent, calling it a “misplaced misinformation campaign.” Tests showed a 2-4 per cent mileage drop depending on vehicle type, he said, adding that E20 has around 6 per cent less energy due to ethanol’s calorific value being 30-35 per cent lower than petrol.On engine impact, Banerjee noted that “millions of vehicles are running and plying E20 for quite some time now, not a single vehicle breakdown has been reported.”ARAI Director Reji Mathai backed the assessment, citing studies from 2016 and 2021 that found no adverse impact from the blended fuel.Highlighting the broader economic benefits, Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI) advisor P S Ravi said ethanol procurement worth Rs 40,000 crore had already been paid to farmers in 2025, driving rural prosperity. Since 2014-15, ethanol blending has substituted 245 LMT of crude oil, saved Rs 1.44 lakh crore in forex, and cut 763 LMT of carbon dioxide emissions.Toyota Kirloskar Motor’s Country Head and Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Vikram Gulati said ethanol blending reduces crude imports and forex outgo, while funnelling money directly to farmers. “The money that would have been sent outside (for importing crude) is now going to farmers, who will now be economically better. They will be able to spend more and they will contribute to the economy,” he said.Gulati added that ethanol is enabling India’s “smooth transition” to sustainability without disrupting the economy, while strengthening self-reliance in energy, technology and raw materials.","The use of 20 per cent ethanol-blended petrol (E20) in vehicles could result in a minor decline of 2-4 per cent in fuel efficiency.

"Trade strategy: Piyush Goyal says India Inc in ‘cosy comfort zone’ of 1.4 bn people market, urges global push amid US tariffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trade-strategy-piyush-goyal-says-india-inc-in-cosy-comfort-zone-of-1-4-bn-market-urges-global-push-amid-us-tariffs/articleshow/123603672.cms,"'India Will Not Be Bullied, Won't Bow Down': Piyush Goyal's Stern Warning To Trump Amid Tariff War





Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal said Indian businesses are in a “cosy comfort zone” created by the vast 1.4 billion-person strong domestic market and need to actively explore opportunities abroad.Speaking at an industry event in Mumbai, Goyal said companies should not get carried away by any “negative narrative”, emphasising that the economy grew 7.8% in June. He added that the performance is a “resounding response” to naysayers, including opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, certain economists and sections of the media.On the impact of high US tariffs on Indian exports, Goyal told PTI that over $46 billion of the $87 billion worth of exports to America remain unaffected. “India is full of resilience, confidence and is raring to continue to be the fastest growing economy for the next 22 years. Our exports will continue to grow, we will do higher exports this year than last year and the future is extremely bright,” he said.He acknowledged that the domestic market remains a big growth driver but cautioned that Indian companies are missing out on global value addition. “I often feel the large 1.4 billion domestic market has become somewhat a cosy comfort zone in which our businesses make good profit and don’t venture out to look at opportunities around the world,” he said.Citing examples, Goyal pointed out that India exports rice but not rice puffs or ready-to-eat products, and iron ore but not high-quality steel. He also noted the weak presence of Indian clothing in global high-street fashion, and urged companies to brand India differently.Goyal stressed that the government is ready to support businesses in tackling challenges. “Ask for help. Give us your support. Don’t lose out this opportunity. Put pressure on us,” he urged captains of industry.On the US tariff move, Goyal said President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 50% tariff on several Indian goods should not deter exporters. He acknowledged challenges in sectors such as textiles, apparel, gems and jewellery, shrimp, and leather, but called for higher value addition to offset the impact.Goyal said he spoke with industrialist Noel Tata, who runs the Zudio and Westside chains, and suggested that US tariff-hit products could be sold in the domestic market at discounted rates until alternative export destinations are found.The minister also pointed to trade agreements under negotiation to diversify India’s export markets and called the 7.8% GDP growth a “morale booster”. He expressed hope that upcoming decisions from the GST Council would further spur demand.Meanwhile, UAE minister for foreign trade Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi said at the same event that India and the Gulf nation will remain close partners regardless of changes in global trade dynamics. “No matter how the world and the partners are dealing with each other, and they’re changing their policies and changing their position against each other, the UAE and India will always be together,” he said.", commerce minister Piyush Goyal said Indian businesses are in a “cosy comfort zone” created by the vast 1.4 billion-person strong domestic market.

"Fiscal roadmap: Govt on track for 4.4% deficit in FY26, DEA Secretary cites strong growth support",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fiscal-roadmap-govt-on-track-for-4-4-deficit-in-fy26-dea-secretary-cites-strong-growth-support/articleshow/123602872.cms,"



Economic Affairs Secretary Anuradha Thakur on Saturday said the government remains on track to achieve its fiscal deficit target of 4.4 per cent of GDP for 2025-26, despite concerns triggered by the latest monthly numbers.The statement came as the Centre’s fiscal deficit touched 29.9 per cent of the full-year target by end-July, sharply higher than 17.2 per cent of the Budget Estimates in the same period last year. The Budget had pegged the fiscal deficit for FY26 at Rs 15.69 lakh crore, or 4.4 per cent of GDP.“So this question (of achieving the target) has been coming up because of the latest numbers. I would like to say that quarter-by-quarter or month-by-month assessments of fiscal deficit numbers may not give a correct picture because of temporal mismatches, which may come in on the receipt and expenditure side. On the overall fiscal deficit numbers, our assessment so far is that we will be able to achieve the target,” Thakur told PTI in an interview.She underlined that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong. “Even private consumption numbers which came out yesterday are showing positive movement. The gross capital formation numbers also showed that both public and private capex are strong and there is anticipation these should be steadfast in the coming quarters as well,” she said.Thakur said government capital expenditure has been a major factor in sustaining growth. “Government capex has been a big factor in holding up our numbers so far and not only on the fiscal deficit side but the growth numbers also remains robust as of now,” she added.Commenting on India’s 7.8 per cent GDP growth in Q1 FY26 — the fastest in five quarters — she said it reflected the broad-based resilience of the economy. “Q1 numbers reflect the basic resilience of our economy. It reflects strengthening of the momentum in the economy and it is anchored in strong macroeconomic fundamentals,” she said.She pointed out that manufacturing, construction, services and agriculture, along with robust domestic demand, had all contributed to the strong performance. Thakur expressed confidence that the momentum would continue in the coming quarters.India’s April-June GDP growth of 7.8 per cent was driven by a strong showing in agriculture and services like trade, hotels, financial and real estate. This pace, the strongest since January-March 2024 when growth hit 8.4 per cent, keeps India ahead of China, which posted 5.2 per cent in the same period.","The Centre’s fiscal deficit touched 29.9 per cent of the full-year target by end-July.

Prophet Muhammad’s birthday on September 5: Will UAE residents get three day weekend?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/prophet-muhammads-birthday-on-september-5-will-uae-residents-get-three-day-weekend/articleshow/123495927.cms,"UAE residents may enjoy a three-day weekend from September 5, 2025, marking Prophet Muhammad’s birthday on Rabi Al Awwal 12/Representative Image

Date determination based on lunar observations





Significance of the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal





Who was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?





Public holiday outlook in the UAE









This year, the Islamic calendar places the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on Friday, September 5, 2025. Based on lunar observations and official announcements, the date could coincide with a long weekend in the UAE, marking a time of spiritual reflection and public observance. Here's a detailed look at how the holiday is determined and why it matters.The Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle, and significant dates—such as religious holidays—are determined by the sighting of the new moon. On Saturday, August 23, 2025, the International Astronomy Center in the UAE confirmed that the crescent moon marking the beginning of Rabi Al Awwal, the third month of the Islamic calendar, was not sighted anywhere across the Arab world.This absence of moon sighting means the start of the month differs by region. Some countries began Rabi Al Awwal on Sunday, while others started it on Monday. In Oman, for instance, the new lunar month started later, which pushed the 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal—the date of Prophet Muhammad's birth anniversary—to Friday, September 5, 2025.Although the UAE government has not yet issued an official holiday announcement, the alignment of this date with the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) has led to speculation that UAE residents may receive a three-day public holiday—Friday through Sunday.The 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal holds profound importance in the Islamic world as it commemorates the birth of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). This day is not only a religious observance but also a moment for Muslims to reflect on the Prophet's life, teachings, and legacy.In many Islamic countries, the day is marked by prayers, religious lectures, and community gatherings. While cultural and traditional expressions of this day vary, the central focus remains on honouring the Prophet’s character, compassion, and leadership.Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the founder of Islam and the final messenger in the line of prophets that includes Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He received and conveyed the Qurʾān, the holy book of Islam, and his teachings form the core of Islamic belief and practice.He was born in Mecca (in present-day Saudi Arabia) around the year 570 CE, known as the Year of the Elephant. His life is recognized not only for its religious significance but also for his role as a spiritual guide and political leader, who transformed Arabian society through principles of justice, mercy, and unity.The Prophet passed away on June 8, 632 CE, in Medina, at approximately 62 years of age. His legacy continues to influence over a billion Muslims around the world.While the UAE’s official public holiday calendar has not confirmed the Prophet’s Birthday holiday yet, the alignment of the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal with Friday, September 5, makes it likely that residents could enjoy an extended weekend. If declared, this would be a three-day break, from Friday to Sunday.Public holidays in the UAE for Islamic events are typically aligned with moon sightings, and dates can vary until officially confirmed. However, based on current astronomical projections and regional observances, the date is becoming increasingly clear.","The Islamic calendar places the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on Friday, September 5, 2025.

'Discriminatory': Putin blasts Western sanctions against Russia; hints at deeper ties with China ahead of visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/discriminatory-putin-blasts-western-sanctions-against-russia-hints-at-deeper-ties-with-china-ahead-of-visit/articleshow/123598327.cms,"Putin (File photo)





Russian President Vladimir Putin criticised Western sanctions ahead of his four-day visit to China, warning that trade restrictions and the costs of the Ukraine war have pushed Russia’s economy into recession, as reported by Reuters.In a written interview with China’s Xinhua news agency on Saturday, Putin said Russia and China were united in rejecting “discriminatory” measures in global trade.Putin’s trip, which the Kremlin described as “unprecedented,” runs from Sunday to Wednesday. He will first attend the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, before travelling to Beijing for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and to take part in a military parade marking the end of World War Two in Asia.The visit follows Xi’s May trip to Moscow, where the Chinese leader attended a military parade on Red Square celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. It was Xi’s 11th visit to Russia since becoming president.Since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions. US President Donald Trump has also warned of “massive” new penalties unless peace talks progress.Putin, however, praised China’s role in shoring up economic ties. “To sum up, economic cooperation, trade and industrial collaboration between our countries are advancing across multiple areas,” he said. “During my upcoming visit, we will certainly discuss further prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation and new steps to intensify it for the benefit of the peoples of Russia and China.”Russia-China trade hit a record $245 billion in 2024, as Beijing increased purchases of Russian oil and expanded goods sales after Western countries cut economic ties with Moscow. “In recent years, the export of pork and beef to China has been launched. Overall, agricultural and food products occupy a prominent place in Russia’s exports to China,” Putin noted.He added that transactions were increasingly being conducted in rubles and yuan, and highlighted Russia’s role as China’s key oil and gas supplier.Putin did not directly address EU accusations that China has been aiding Russia’s war effort in Ukraine—allegations Beijing has consistently denied.The two leaders declared a “no limits” partnership in 2022 and have met more than 40 times in the past decade. Putin last visited China in 2024, a year after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant against him for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children.","Vladimir Putin says Russia and China are united in rejecting 'discriminatory' measures in global trade.

'Financial ruin' for US? What happens if Trump tariffs are struck down by court — Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/financial-ruin-for-us-what-happens-if-trump-tariffs-are-struck-down-by-court-explained/articleshow/123596894.cms,"US President Donald Trump (Pic credit: AP)

India ‘Laughs’ As Trump SCREAMS ‘Disaster’ At US Court’s Ruling Against Tariffs | ‘No Power To...’

Tariffs still in place (for now)



A $159 billion refund risk



Trump's negotiating power weakens



Supreme Court showdown looms



Limited backup options on tariffs



Even if the Supreme Court blocks his broad use of IEEPA, Trump still has fallback options — though far narrower.

Trade Act of 1974: Allows tariffs up to 15% for 150 days on countries with big US trade deficits.

Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962: Lets presidents impose tariffs on ""national security"" grounds (used before on steel, aluminium, and autos). But this requires a commerce department investigation and isn't instant.

The road ahead



(with inputs from agencies)





The US federal court's ruling over the tariff, calling it ""illegal"", came as a major setback for President Donald Trump . The court said that the Republican leader overstepped his authority when he declared trade deficits and border issues as ""national emergencies"" to justify sweeping tariffs he imposed on nearly every trading partner.Trump who has wielded tariffs as his favourite weapon in global trade battles, vowed to head toward Supreme Court. The bigger question is: what happens next?The US court of appeals for the federal circuit said that Trump went too far to justify his tariff weapon. The court upheld a May decision by a specialised federal trade court in New York, but allowed the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.The decision was centred on the tariffs Trump imposed in April on almost all US trading partners and the levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.Meanwhile, the court allowed the tariffs to remain in place while Trump appeals. That means businesses, consumers, and foreign governments are still living under the uncertainty of his trade war tactics — at least until the Supreme Court weighs in.US administration fears that if tariffs are ultimately struck down, then the Treasury could be forced to refund billions collected from importers. By July, tariff revenues had soared to $159 billion — more than expected.The justice department had warned that losing the case could mean ""financial ruin"" for the US — a dramatic warning that underscores how deeply tariffs now prop up federal revenue streams.""In such a scenario, people would be forced from their homes, millions of jobs would be eliminated, hardworking Americans would lose their savings, and even Social Security and Medicare could be threatened,"" solicitor general D John Sauer and assistant attorney general Brett Shumate said in a letter to the court, warning of an apocalyptic doomsday if tariffs were struck down.""In short, the economic consequences would be ruinous, instead of unprecedented success,"" the letter added.The ruling threatens one of Trump’s most potent bargaining chips. He has used the threat of tariffs to strong-arm countries into lopsided trade deals — as seen with the EU, Japan, and the UK.Without this tool, experts say, foreign governments may stall on commitments, resist US demands, or even try to reopen old deals. Trump could find himself negotiating from a position of weakness, not dominance.Trump has promised to take the case to the Supreme Court, blasting the appeals ruling as partisan and warning it would ""literally destroy the United States of America"" if upheld.""For many years, Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians. Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again! Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform.The dissenting opinion in the appeals court gives him a potential legal opening: some judges argued that emergency tariff powers do not violate the Constitution. That split makes it almost certain the Supreme Court will take up the case.These tools lack the sweeping, unilateral punch Trump has enjoyed — and could slow his ability to shock foreign governments into concessions.In the short term, Trump's tariffs stand. In the medium term, the Supreme Court will decide whether presidents truly have unchecked emergency powers to upend global trade.If Trump loses, America could face both a massive financial refund and a strategic reset in how it conducts trade negotiations.For now, US businesses, trading partners, and consumers remain trapped in limbo — waiting to see whether Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs mark a new era of presidential trade authority, or an overreach cut down by the courts.","The US court of appeals for the federal circuit said that Trump went too far to justify his tariff weapon.

Special Report.





China's trade representative Li Chenggang conducted meetings in the United States, between August 27-29, engaging with US officials regarding economic and trade relationships between the two nations, according to the Chinese commerce ministry on Saturday, quoted by Reuters.During his visit, Li conducted meetings with officials from the US department of the treasury, department of commerce, and office of the US trade representative to discuss the progress of previously established agreements.Li emphasised that both nations should address their differences and strengthen collaborative efforts through balanced discussions and consultations.This comes as the US Senate Armed Services Committee visited Taiwan on Friday to “reemphasize the partnership and the security, friendship agreement” between the two sides, at a time when both Taipei and Beijing are seeking trade deals with Washington.The US does not formally recognize Taiwan as a country but remains its largest arms supplier and key security partner, with their forces frequently conducting joint military drills to counter China.Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly objected to deepening US-Taiwan ties, condemning such visits and accusing Washington of endangering peace. On Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry reiterated its firm opposition to any official exchanges between the US and Taiwan.However, earlier this month, amid the tense China-Taiwan situation, Trump had said that Chinese President Xi Jinping had assured him China would not invade Taiwan during his presidency, Reuters reported. The comments came in a Fox News interview ahead of Trump’s talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.“I will tell you, you know, you have a very similar thing with President Xi of China and Taiwan, but I don't believe there's any way it's going to happen as long as I'm here. We'll see,” Trump told Fox News’“He told me, 'I will never do it as long as you're president.' President Xi told me that, and I said, 'Well, I appreciate that,' but he also said, 'But I am very patient, and China is very patient,'” Trump added.","China's trade representative Li Chenggang conducted meetings in the United States, between August 27-29, engaging with US officials.

'Much more work to be done’: US Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy; operations to continue during process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/much-more-work-to-be-done-us-spirit-airlines-files-for-bankruptcy-operations-to-continue-during-process/articleshow/123594478.cms,"Spirit Airlines to file for bankruptcy (Representative image)





US Budget airline Spirit Airlines announced on Friday that has filed file for bankruptcy again within a year, but will maintain normal operations, ticket sales and flights.Following its initial bankruptcy filing in November, Spirit had completed a debt restructuring agreement with creditors in March, reducing its liabilities by approximately £800 million.""Since emerging from our previous restructuring, which was targeted exclusively on reducing Spirit's funded debt and raising equity capital, it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future,"" said Spirit President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Davis in a statement on Friday, as quoted by Reuters.The Florida-headquartered company indicated that with this new filing, it ""expects to double down on its efforts to"" reorganise its routes, ""rightsize its fleet,"" and seek additional cost-saving measures.Spirit said that ""The Chapter 11 process will provide Spirit the tools, time and flexibility to continue ongoing discussions with all of its lessors, financial creditors and other parties to implement a financial and operational transformation of the Company.""In April, Dave Davis from Sun Country Airlines succeeded Ted Christie as the company's chief executive. Dave Davis, Spirit's president and CEO, said, ""As we move forward, guests can continue to rely on Spirit to provide high-value travel options and connect them with the people and places that matter most.""Still, the company posted a net loss of about $246 million in the three months to end-June. Struggling with a cash crunch, it said last week it had drawn down the full $275 million available under its revolving credit line, as reported by Reuters. Additionally, according to industry analysts and executives, Spirit’s woes trace back to its inability to streamline its inflated cost structure during its first bankruptcy. In the latest quarter, operating expenses reached $1.2 billion—equal to 118 per cent of its revenue.Spirit is also embroiled in a dispute with aircraft lessor AerCap Holdings over a deal for 36 Airbus planes scheduled for delivery in 2027–28. As part of its restructuring plan, the airline said it will scale back operations in select markets and shrink its fleet to meaningfully cut debt and lease liabilities—moves it expects will yield hundreds of millions of dollars in annual operating savings.The low-cost carrier expanded its capacity and market presence following the Covid pandemic but encountered heightened competition from rival airlines.In 2022, competitor Frontier Airlines proposed a £2.9 billion merger with Spirit. Subsequently, JetBlue presented a potentially more valuable offer, but regulatory authorities' antitrust concerns prevented the deal's completion.","Budget airline Spirit Airlines announced on Friday that has filed file for bankruptcy again within a year.

Canada’s economy shrank at an annualised pace of 1.6% in the second quarter as exports took a hit from tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, Statistics Canada said on Friday. This marked the country’s first GDP contraction in seven quarters.The agency also revised down its first-quarter growth estimate from 2.2% to 2.0%, underscoring the impact of Washington’s trade actions on the world’s ninth-largest economy, AFP reported.Canadian exports fell sharply by 7.5% in the April-June period after a 1.4% rise in the previous quarter. International shipments of passenger cars and light trucks plunged 24.7%, while exports of industrial machinery and equipment dropped 18.5%. Travel services were also down 11.1%, the data showed.The sharper-than-expected decline has raised expectations that the Bank of Canada may move to cut interest rates when it meets in September. The central bank has left its benchmark rate unchanged at 2.75% in its past three policy meetings.However, robust domestic activity partially offset the external shock. Household consumption jumped 4.5% annualized, residential investment rose 6.3%, and government spending increased 5.1%, leading to overall domestic demand growth of 3.5%, according to Reuters.On a monthly basis, June GDP contracted 0.1%, primarily due to a slowdown in goods-producing industries, which make up around a quarter of the economy. “That weaker-than-expected trend in the monthly figures makes today’s release supportive for our forecast of a September interest rate cut,” said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.The contraction raised market expectations for a Bank of Canada (BoC) rate cut next month. Money markets now price in a 48% probability of a September 17 rate reduction, up from 40% prior to the GDP release.An advance estimate for July by Reuters suggested a 0.1% month-on-month expansion, indicating that Q3 could show minimal growth. Royce Mendes, managing director at Desjardins, noted, “While the July flash showed the economy largely recovered lost ground from June, early tracking points to a flat-to-slightly-negative estimate for Q3 GDP.”The Canadian dollar traded lower at 1.3771 per US dollar (72.62 US cents), while yields on two-year government bonds declined 2.8 basis points to 2.664%.Economists noted that jobs and inflation data for August would be critical for the BoC’s rate decision. Despite weak exports, domestic spending strength demonstrates underlying resilience, leaving policymakers with a mixed picture as they weigh potential action.","Canadian exports fell sharply by 7.5% in the April-June period after a 1.4% rise in the previous quarter.

US economy: Fed’s inflation gauge steady at 2.6% in July; core prices edge higher to 2.9%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-price-gauge-steady-in-july-core-inflation-ticks-higher-fed-cautious-on-rate-cuts/articleshow/123585849.cms,"



The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge held steady in July even as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs added pressure on the economy, but a key measure of underlying prices climbed to the highest level in five months.The Commerce Department on Friday said overall prices rose 2.6% in July from a year earlier, unchanged from June, AP reported. Excluding food and energy, core prices increased 2.9% year-on-year, up from 2.8% in June and the sharpest since February.The figures highlight why many Fed officials remain reluctant to ease borrowing costs. Inflation has cooled sharply from its 7% peak three years ago but continues to run above the central bank’s 2% target.The report also offered some signs of resilience in household demand. Consumer spending jumped 0.5% in July, the biggest monthly gain since March, with strong outlays on cars, appliances and furniture. Incomes rose 0.4% over the month, boosted by wage and salary gains.On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices rose 0.2% from June, down from 0.3% in the previous month, while core prices advanced 0.3% for the second consecutive month.The trend closely tracked the consumer price index, which earlier this month showed a 2.7% annual rise, with the core CPI up 3.1% in July.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled that the central bank is likely to cut its key interest rate at its next meeting but stressed that policymakers will proceed cautiously. “It’s not clear how many more rate cuts will happen this year,” he said.When the Fed lowers its benchmark rate, borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business lending typically fall, though not always.Trump, meanwhile, has continued to berate Powell and the Fed over monetary policy. Since earlier this year, the president has labelled Powell “Too Late” and a “moron,” insisting there is “no inflation.” On Monday, Trump sought to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed’s board, in what analysts saw as a bid to assert greater control over the central bank.","Consumer prices rose 2.6% in July from a year earlier, unchanged from June.

US postal policy shift: De minimis ends after 86 years- all you need to know about the scrapped rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-postal-policy-shift-de-minimis-ends-after-86-years-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-scrapped-rule/articleshow/123581064.cms,"Representative AI image

What was the De Minimis rule?

What changes now?

Who is affected?





The United States has moved to end its long-standing de minimis tariff exemption for small international packages, eliminating duty-free entry for imports valued at $800 or less.The change, effective Friday, August 29, follows an executive order issued last month and comes nearly two years earlier than the original Congressional timeline. It is expected to affect millions of daily e-commerce deliveries into the US.The de minimis exemption allowed low-value imports to enter the US without paying customs duties, easing cross-border e-commerce. Introduced in 1938 at just $1, the threshold was gradually raised—$5 in 1990, $200 in 1993, and $800 in 2015. In 2023, 1.36 billion packages worth $64 billion entered duty-free under this system, compared with 134 million in 2015, as reported by Economic Times.Both now-president Trump and his predecessor Biden had raised concerns about misuse of the rule, including for smuggling illicit goods such as fentanyl, and its impact on US businesses.Also read: Donald Trump scraps duty-free parcel exemption rule; cites tariff evasion, drug smuggling Starting Friday, all imports will face US customs duties based on their country of origin and product category.Tariff rates range between 10 per cent and 50 per cent- for example, around 10 per cent for shipments from the UK and Australia, and as high as 50 per cent for goods from Brazil and India.Carriers must now file proper documentation for each shipment. Where paperwork is incomplete, they can opt to pay a flat duty of $80–$200 per package for six months as postal systems adapt. Personal gifts worth under $100 and traveller items up to $200 will still enter duty-free.China and Hong Kong dominate the small-package trade, accounting for about 60 per cent of US-bound shipments in 2024. Other major suppliers include Canada, Mexico, the EU, India and Vietnam.The new tariffs are likely to raise prices for online shoppers and reshape global e-commerce flows. Companies such as Shein and Temu, which already have large US distribution networks, may benefit as consumers seek cheaper alternatives despite added duties.","The United States has moved to end its long-standing de minimis tariff exemption for small international packages.

According to government data cited by AP, hiring has slowed significantly since spring. Job gains averaged at 35,000 a month in the three months to July, less than a quarter of last year’s pace.Unemployment benefit claims are a key proxy for layoffs and have mostly stayed in the range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the country emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic more than three years ago.Despite the low level of layoffs, hiring has weakened, a trend many economists now call a “no hire, no fire” economy. The unemployment rate remains at a relatively low 4.2%.Economic growth has also cooled this year, with businesses holding back on expansion plans amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. The economy grew at just a 1.3% annual rate in the first half of 2025, down from 2.5% in 2024, AP reported.The slowdown has increased expectations that the Fed could cut interest rates at its next meeting on 16–17 September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled last week that a reduction in the key rate may be on the cards, which could in turn lower costs for mortgages, car loans and business borrowing.The latest report also showed that the four-week average of claims, which smooths out fluctuations, rose by 2,500 to 228,500.The number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits for the week ending August 16 slipped by 7,000 to 1.95 million. Though slightly lower, that figure is still close to a four-year high, pointing to the difficulties many jobseekers face in securing new work once unemployed.","Applications for jobless aid dropped by 5,000 to 229,000 for the week ending 23 August.

Donald Trump vs Fed gov: Lisa Cook sues Trump admin; asks to 'confirm her status' as board member,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-vs-fed-gov-lisa-cook-sues-trump-admin-asks-to-confirm-her-status-as-board-member/articleshow/123567129.cms,"Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has taken the Trump administration to court after the US president tried to fire her.Cook’s lawsuit, filed by lawyer Abbe David Lowell, seeks an injunction to block her dismissal and “confirm her status” as a member of the central bank’s governing board.The case is being seen as an extraordinary legal fight that could redefine Fed’s independence. In the institution’s 112 years, no US president has ever attempted to fire a Fed governor, until Donald Trump published a letter on social media announcing that Cook had been removed.He stated that she was being fired because of allegations of mortgage fraud dating back to 2021, before she joined the board, AP reported.Most observing the matter expect the battle to end up before the Supreme Court . The Court has previously said the president cannot dismiss Fed officials over disagreements on policy, but can do so “for cause,” a term that usually covers misconduct or neglect of duty. Cook, however, has not been charged with any crime.Her lawsuit argues that the claims have nothing to do with her work at the Fed and remain unproven. It also argues she was not given a chance to respond before being targeted.""The unsubstantiated and unproven allegation that Governor Cook ‘potentially’ erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to her Senate confirmation—does not amount to 'cause,'"" the filing says, as cited by AP.“Allowing the President to remove members of the Board over policy disagreements would also render illusory the Board’s independence,” it continues.The move comes as Trump has stepped up attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell and the central bank’s interest-rate committee for not lowering borrowing costs more quickly. However, Powell has already signalled another rate cut could be coming at the 16–17 September meeting.Cook’s suit suggests the allegations are just an excuse to get rid of her, “the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve.”As the Trump has previously said that he will only nominate people who back lower rates, the dismissal attempt paves the way for the White House to appoint a Trump loyalist, AP reported.The Fed is one of the most powerful institutions in the US economy, influencing the cost of mortgages, car loans and business borrowing by setting short-term interest rates.If the courts allow Trump’s firing of Cook to stand, analysts warn it could strip the Fed of its ability to act independently. That would make it harder for the bank to take unpopular steps, such as raising rates to control inflation.","Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has taken the Trump administration to court after the US president tried to fire her.

However, its shares weakened after a fall in key data centre revenue, raising questions about whether the AI surge can continue at the same pace.""The market seems to be asking whether Nvidia can keep up this pace as competition intensifies and AI enthusiasm starts to look a little overbought,"" said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at traders Scope Markets.Alongside earnings, markets reacted to US data showing the world’s largest economy expanded by 3.3 percent in the second quarter, up from the 3.0% first estimated in July.""After the initial release, there were concerns that the domestic economy was slowing quite sharply,"" said Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm.According to the US commerce department, the upward revision was mainly due to stronger investment and consumer spending. Growth was also supported by a fall in US imports, after businesses had rushed to stockpile ahead of tariff increases announced by US President Donald Trump.The figures could influence the outlook for interest rates, with the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting borrowing costs to support growth.""Overall, this release probably doesn't change Federal Reserve thinking too much,"" Flax said, noting that a 25-basis-point rate cut is still likely at the Fed’s September meeting.""But a stronger than expected result from domestic demand suggests that there might not be that much scope to cut rates over the next 12 months.""","The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both opened higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in red.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

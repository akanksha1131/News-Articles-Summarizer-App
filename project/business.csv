Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East. With the US declaring a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, the safe haven demand for gold has somewhat gone down. What’s the outlook for gold and silver prices in the near future and what gold and silver rate levels should investors look at? Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views:Gold is currently holding a crucial support level around ₹95,800. This zone is significant, as a strong reversal from here could potentially trigger a recovery in prices, targeting the ₹98,500 mark. This level also coincides with a previously unfilled gap, making it a key technical target for traders watching for a bounce.Despite a recent 4% correction in gold prices, the broader trend remains positive. The pullback is being viewed as a healthy retracement within a larger bullish structure, and market sentiment continues to favor the upside, especially amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global demand for safe-haven assets.A sustained move above ₹98,500 would be a strong bullish signal, clearing the way for a possible retest of the psychological ₹100,000 mark. Momentum traders may closely watch for confirmation above this resistance level to enter fresh long positions. On the downside, if ₹95,800 fails to hold, it could invite further selling pressure, but for now, the support remains intact. Overall, the bias remains positive, with technical indicators pointing to a potential recovery, provided key levels are respected. Investors are advised to stay alert for price action cues around the ₹95,800–₹98,500 range.MCX Silver has recently witnessed a sharp decline of around 5% from its recent highs, triggering short-term concerns among traders. However, despite this pullback, the broader trend for silver remains firmly positive. The recent correction appears to be a temporary pause within an ongoing bullish trajectory, rather than a reversal of the larger trend.The ₹102,500 level is emerging as a crucial support zone, and price action near this area will be key in determining the next move. This level has historically provided a base for reversals, and a strong bounce from here could reignite bullish momentum. Technical indicators suggest that as long as this support holds, the upside potential remains intact.On the higher side, silver prices have the potential to reclaim the ₹109,000 level, which represents a significant resistance zone and a near-term target for buyers. A sustained move above this resistance could pave the way for further gains in the medium term.Overall, while short-term volatility may persist, the underlying strength in silver remains. Traders and investors should closely monitor the ₹102,500 support for signs of reversal, as it could offer a favorable risk-reward entry point for the next leg higher.","Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East.

Asian markets show optimism: Stocks steady as US-Canada trade talks progress; eye on US jobs data due this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-markets-show-optimism-stocks-steady-as-us-canada-trade-talks-progress-eye-on-us-jobs-data-due-this-week/articleshow/122150915.cms,"AI-generated image

Asian equity markets showed strength on Monday, buoyed by optimism over US-Canada trade negotiations and sustained demand in the global technology sector. However, gains were tempered by concerns around upcoming US employment data, which weighed on the dollar.Japan’s Nikkei led the region with a 1.6 per cent gain, supported by strong performances in tech and export-oriented stocks. South Korea's benchmark index also rose 0.8 per cent, following a positive lead from Wall Street.Chinese markets were mixed. The blue-chip CSI300 index edged up 0.2 per cent, helped by improved June data in manufacturing and services, while broader Asian sentiment remained cautious. The MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index dipped 0.2 per cent.The market gains came amid encouraging signals from North America, where Canada on Sunday agreed to drop its proposed digital services tax in a bid to move forward trade negotiations with the US. Talks, originally slated to wrap up by July 9 under President Donald Trump 's directive, have now been extended to July 21, with a potential finalisation by Labor Day (September 1). This is a significant turning point as Trump had announced suspension of trade talkswith Canada just days ago.Read more: US-Canada trade talks resume as PM Carney revokes tax on US tech firms Tech stocks continued to drive momentum globally, with Nasdaq futures up 0.4 per cent and S&P 500 e-minis rising 0.3 per cent.

Gold Price Outlook

Stance: Sideways to lower.

Broad range: 93,500-96,500

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have been trading lower as geopolitical tensions ease and demand for safe haven assets falls. However, the downside has been capped by a weaker US dollar. What’s the outlook for the gold rate in the coming days and what’s the range in which gold prices are likely to trade?Gold prices traded largely steady last week, weighed by easing Middle East tensions and muted US economic cues. While investors initially remained cautious over potential Iranian retaliation following US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a ceasefire brokered by President Trump brought some calm, with both Iran and Israel signalling commitment to halt hostilities.This reduced safe-haven demand, pushing gold to a near six-week low. Still, a weaker dollar and bargain hunting helped limit further losses. In the US, Federal Reserve officials struck a mixed tone, with Vice Chair Bowman indicating that rate cuts may soon be necessary due to risks to the labor market, while others like Cleveland Fed President Hammack urged caution amid inflation uncertainty.Market participants now await for more clarity on the Fed’s rate path.On the geopolitical front, investors remain watchful for any ceasefire violations or renewed tensions.Meanwhile, progress in US-China trade talks, especially over rare earth shipments, helped boost broader risk appetite, though President Trump reignited tensions with Canada over digital taxes. The holiday-shortened week ahead could see subdued volumes, but volatility may persist depending on economic data and geopolitical updates.","Gold prices have been trading lower as geopolitical tensions ease and demand for safe haven assets falls.

"As commissions fall, flat fee reshapes ride-hailing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/as-commissions-fall-flat-fee-reshapes-ride-hailing/articleshow/122147391.cms,"Bengaluru: Ola has introduced a nationwide flat fee model for its cab-hailing business, allowing drivers to retain 100% of their earnings after paying a fixed daily access charge of Rs 67. This move replaces the long-standing commission structure, where platforms deducted 20%-30% per trip, marking a significant shift in India's ride-hailing economics.Internally, senior Ola executives acknowledge that the move is as much a response to intensifying market pressure as it is an attempt to win back disenchanted drivers. ""Why Ola did this is because it is rapidly losing market share, and the network effect of supply and demand was waning for us. It's a race to the bottom, a desperate hail mary. It will eat up margins,"" one senior executive said. To make the math work, Ola has implemented sweeping cost cuts, shutting down its acquisition team that was 1,000 strong at its peak, reducing incentives, and relying more on automation. ""We charged 20% commissions earlier, but nearly half of it went back to customer and driver incentives. In the flat fee model, we cut down incentives significantly and eliminated that cost base, making room for more tech-driven efficiency.,""another senior executive said.According to Saurav Kumar Chachan, associate partner at RedSeer, India's ride-hailing market is dominated by cabs, which account for roughly 50-55% of gross merchandise value (GMV), followed by auto rickshaws at about 35% and two-wheelers making up roughly 10-12%.In the top seven cities, average fares range from Rs 300-400 per trip, while in smaller cities, the average is closer to Rs 200-250. ""Drivers in top metros typically complete about eight trips per day and work roughly 25 days a month, totalling around 220-240 trips per month,"" Chachan said.At an average fare of Rs 300 per trip, this translates to gross earnings of roughly Rs 2,400 per day or Rs 60,000 per month. Under the traditional 25% commission model, that meant a net income of roughly Rs 1,800 per day and Rs 45,000 per month for the driver. Under the new Rs 67 a day flat fee structure, net earnings rise to roughly Rs 2,333 per day and Rs 58,325 per month.While the shift improves earnings potential for experienced drivers, it also shifts more risk to their side. ""Flat fee ride-hailing models promise drivers full control over earnings, but also shift financial risk away from platforms,"" said Pratik Shah, partner at EY Parthenon. ""For experienced drivers in high-demand areas, it can yield higher take-home pay. But for newcomers or those in low-traffic zones, it may feel more like exposure than empowerment.

Rise of Zohran Mamdani

Wall Street worried

The possible victory of Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, in the upcoming New York mayoral polls has people on Wall Street worried.In Manhattan's financial district, pessimistic predictions are circulating. According to Wall Street recruitment specialist Michael Nelson, his clientele, typically earning above $1 million annually, express serious concerns.""This will be the end of New York City as we know it"" reflects the sentiment amongst his affluent clients regarding Mamdani's potential November victory, he told Bloomberg.The impact is already visible in New York City property-related stocks. Flagstar Financial Inc., which provides loans to apartment complexes, experienced up to 6.7% decline on Wednesday. Property companies Empire State Realty Trust, SL Green Realty and Vornado Realty Trust also registered losses.Even critics acknowledge that Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, has garnered significant public support.""It's officially hot commie summer,"" wrote hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb on X, following Mamdani's unexpected victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.Also Read | Days of South Asians being ignored and erased in New York politics are gone, says Zohran Kwame Mamdani The statement reflects the genuine concern amongst the city's wealthy circles that a Mamdani victory in the November general election would result in increased taxation, potentially causing affluent residents to leave the five boroughs.An important detail is that Mamdani’s tax proposals would require approval from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul, who has expressed opposition. Additionally, Mamdani's plan to raise $70 billion in debt faces significant obstacles.According to Kathy Wylde, a prominent New York intermediary who has facilitated connections between business leaders from finance, real estate and media with city officials for years, whilst Mamdani appeals to the youth, his ideological stance causes significant concern among taxpayers and employers.However, Mamdani successfully gained support from voters across diverse socioeconomic and racial communities.In his Wednesday morning address, he emphasised that ""a life of dignity should not be reserved for a fortunate few.""The foundation of his success lay in a strategic social media campaign that combined populist economic policies and progressive cultural messaging through viral-worthy video content.On Tuesday, he featured in an Instagram video alongside Emily Ratajkowski, who commands over 29 million followers. The model and actress sported a ""Hot Girls for Zohran"" t-shirt whilst encouraging voter turnout.This exemplified the clever strategy that enabled Mamdani to build a substantial volunteer base numbering in tens of thousands. These supporters diligently canvassed neighbourhoods, maintained street presence and utilised social media to reach voters. They promoted his policy agenda: Free childcare, state-operated grocery shops with reduced prices, complimentary bus transport, rent controls and additional measures - largely funded through increased taxation of wealthy individuals.New York's establishment elite supported Cuomo, a 67-year-old Democratic veteran who positioned himself as an experienced centrist capable of addressing the city's challenges, from underground transit safety to the widely recognised cost-of-living issues.His campaign received substantial financial backing from prominent figures, including Michael R. Bloomberg, founder and primary owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, along with Bill Ackman, Loeb and Vornado's Steven Roth. His political action committee, Fix the City, accumulated an unprecedented primary campaign fund of nearly $25 million.However, the campaign's advertising strategy predominantly focused on criticising Mamdani rather than highlighting Cuomo's administrative plans. Despite resigning as New York governor following sexual harassment claims, which he contests, Cuomo maintained strong establishment support, including an endorsement from former President Bill Clinton.In contrast, Mamdani received endorsements from progressive leaders, including Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders.Some financial sector representatives appear to be considering a more accepting stance towards the democratic socialist candidate.""While we might disagree on certain issues, we should always be hopeful that Mamdani — if he ends up being elected mayor — can unite the city to address its critical education, public safety, housing and economic development needs,"" said Ralph Schlosstein, former head of Evercore Inc. and a longtime Democrat, according to the Bloomberg report.According to Rich Farley, an experienced Wall Street legal expert, numerous affluent residents view the November general election as crucial. A Mamdani victory could prompt wealthy individuals to seriously consider relocating from the city.Before this contest, high-net-worth donors must determine their stance towards Mamdani. Cuomo, potentially running as an independent, needs to convince supporters of his viability outside the Democratic primary framework.Should he continue his campaign, he will face Republican Curtis Sliwa and incumbent Eric Adams, who is running independently after avoiding the primary following corruption allegations.Some Wall Street professionals are contemplating more decisive actions.""I've already talked to hedge fund guys who have told me they have got a foot out the door,"" said Eric Rosen, who previously held senior positions at JPMorgan and in hedge fund management.""I left New York City 8 years ago because I didn't like the way the city was being run,"" he said. ""I sold my Park Ave. co-op and its now down 25% and my house in Florida is up 250%. The market has spoken.""","Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, won the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.

ITR Filing Deadline Extended: Why It Happened And What To Do Now? | Income Tax Return | Explained

ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: Which Form For Gig Workers?

Importantly, ITR-1 and ITR-2 do not apply to income from freelancing or gig work. Selecting the correct form is crucial for smooth return processing and to avoid errors or compliance notices.

Freelancers maintaining books of accounts and claiming actual business expenses should file ITR-3 .

. Alternatively, those in specified professions—such as legal, accounting, or technical consultancy etc—with gross receipts up to Rs 50 lakh (or Rs 75 lakh if cash receipts do not exceed 5% of the total gross receipts) may opt for ITR-4 under the presumptive taxation scheme. Under the presumptive taxation scheme, 50% of gross receipts are deemed taxable, simplifying compliance by eliminating the need for detailed bookkeeping.

Income Tax Return (ITR) e-filing FY 2024-25: ITR filing may be relatively straightforward for salaried individuals, but what about gig workers and those who earn through freelancing? With the rise of freelance and gig-based income, many individuals are unsure how to report such earnings correctly.The ITR filing for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) has been partially thrown open on the Income Tax Portal incometax.gov.in. Individuals who have to file their tax returns using ITR-1 or ITR-4 forms can now do so. So which ITR form should gig workers and free lancers use to file their ITR for FY 2024-25?As non-traditional work arrangements grow, understanding the appropriate tax filing requirements is essential for freelancers and gig workers to remain compliant and minimize potential issues.According to Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India, income from independent work—such as writing, design, consulting, tuition, or platform-based gigs like ride-sharing and food delivery—is treated as “Profits and Gains from Business or Profession” under Indian tax law.Amarpal Chadha tells TOI that ITR-4 cannot be filed if the taxpayer has incomes like short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains u/s 112A exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh, income from and reporting of foreign assets, etc.""If an individual who is a freelancer or gig worker has capital gains referred above, they will have to file ITR - 3. Ideally, ITR -3 isto be used for business income. However, ITR-4 is an option if your income in under certain limits to make the return process simpler. If those conditions are not met, they will have to stick to ITR-3,"" he says.Also Read | Income Tax Return: Are capital gains from MFs taxed differently under new & old regime?

In a landmark development, the Group of Seven (G7) nations have agreed to exempt US-headquartered multinational corporations from key provisions of the global minimum tax agreement under a new ""side-by-side"" system.British businesses will also benefit from similar relief.As per news agency ANI, the new proposal, backed by the US and its G7 partners, will allow American firms to be taxed only domestically, on both foreign and local profits, rather than face additional top-up taxes overseas.The framework recognises existing US tax laws, specifically its domestic minimum tax, and offers a carve-out from the OECD’s Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR).The G7 announcement, released by Canada, which currently holds the rotating presidency, said the system was intended to “provide greater stability and certainty in the international tax system moving forward.”The breakthrough came after the United States dropped Section 899, a controversial clause in US President Donald Trump’s tax bill, which had proposed retaliatory taxes on foreign companies operating in the US.According to news agency Reuters, its removal paved the way for broader agreement and eased concerns in countries like the UK, where businesses feared exposure to punitive tax provisions.British finance minister Rachel Reeves welcomed the development and was quoted by Reuters as saying, “Today’s agreement provides much-needed certainty and stability for those businesses after they had raised their concerns.”Reeves also reaffirmed the UK’s continued efforts to combat aggressive tax avoidance globally.The move follows concerns raised earlier this year after Trump pulled the US out of the 2021 OECD-brokered global tax deal through an executive order. That landmark agreement, supported by nearly 140 countries under the Inclusive Framework, had aimed to ensure large multinational companies pay at least a 15% tax rate globally.According to news agency AFP, Trump also threatened retaliatory taxes on countries applying the global rules to US companies, a step that created apprehension among international investors.With the Section 899 provision now withdrawn, the new dual-track solution reflects a broader consensus among G7 nations to preserve tax sovereignty while maintaining progress on tackling base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).The US Treasury said on X that this side-by-side approach would ""preserve important gains made by jurisdictions inside the Inclusive Framework"" and that it looks forward to developing this solution further through constructive discussions.The agreement now awaits further deliberation at the OECD level to determine how exemptions for US and UK firms will be formally recognised under the global tax regime.G7 leaders reiterated that the final solution must be ""acceptable and implementable to all.""","G7 nations have agreed to exempt US-headquartered multinational corporations from key provisions of the global minimum tax agreement under a new ""side-by- side"" system.

Starlink India: What’s next?

Security watch, spectrum talks shape Starlink’s rollout

Elon Musk-owned Starlink is poised to receive its final regulatory approval to launch satellite communication services in India, with space regulator IN-SPACe issuing a draft authorisation document for the company to sign. Once completed, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre will countersign the document, effectively clearing the way for Starlink to begin operations.The development will place Starlink on par with existing satcom players Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite, both of whom have already secured similar approvals. Starlink received its Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence last month, becoming the third company in India permitted to offer satellite-based communication services, reported ET.Despite receiving the GMPCS licence and being close to final authorisation, Starlink must still fulfil critical operational and security requirements before launching commercial services in India. The company is now required to set up ground infrastructure, including satellite earth stations, communication gateways, and a control and monitoring centre within Indian territory.Following the installation of these systems, Starlink will have to demonstrate service functionality for security clearance, a mandatory step for all satcom operators.Without this security nod, companies are not permitted to commercially roll out services, even if they hold all necessary licences.Rivals OneWeb and Jio Satellite, which received their GMPCS permits in 2021 and 2022 respectively, are still awaiting security approval. Both companies were allocated trial spectrum by the department of telecommunications (DoT) last year to test their systems and demonstrate compliance. This trial allocation has now been extended by six months.Starlink’s progress will be closely watched by Indian security agencies, especially in light of earlier concerns. Authorities previously raised alarms over the unauthorised use of Starlink terminals in sensitive regions like the Northeast. The ministry of home affairs flagged the issue to the DoT in March this year, leading to increased scrutiny of the company’s operations and data-sharing practices.Under India’s satcom regulations, all traffic must be monitored within the country, pass through Indian gateways, and comply with local control protocols. Companies are also required to create buffer zones along international borders as part of the operational mandate.The DoT is expected to soon allocate a trial spectrum to Starlink to allow for demonstrations of its services and security compliance.India is simultaneously working on streamlining its satellite spectrum allocation policy. The telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) has recommended that satcom spectrum be assigned administratively for five years. The proposed fee is set at 4% of a provider’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR).For urban users, an additional charge of Rs 500 per subscriber annually is expected, while no such cost will be levied for rural users. Notably, there will be no upfront fee or allocation cost for satellite spectrum under these recommendations.In a sign of the government’s growing interest in satellite connectivity, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia recently met top SpaceX officials to discuss opportunities to use satellite technologies for expanding India’s digital infrastructure","Elon Musk-owned Starlink is poised to receive its final regulatory approval to launch satellite communication services in India.

US retirement age hits 67 by 2026: Early retirees to lose up to 30% in benefits- what it means for social security income,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-retirement-age-hits-67-by-2026-early-retirees-to-lose-up-to-30-in-benefits-what-it-means-for-social-security-income/articleshow/122126781.cms,"Representative image

Why the retirement age is increasing



T he full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security benefits in the United States will increase to 67 starting in 2026, affecting millions of Americans planning their retirement. Those opting to retire early at age 62 could see up to a 30 per cent reduction in monthly benefits.The change stems from reforms signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan in 1983 to address long-term financial challenges facing the Social Security system. The original Social Security Act, introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935, initially set the retirement age at 65.The FRA has been rising gradually since 1991, increasing by two months per year. It reached 66 in 1996 and will reach 67 in 2026 for individuals turning 65 that year and beyond.When the social security act was created, life expectancy in the US was just 61. By 1983, it had risen to over 74, and today it stands at 79. At the same time, the number of workers supporting each retiree has dropped, from 8.6 in 1955 to 2.8 in 2013, placing greater pressure on the system.The 1983 amendment was designed to address these demographic shifts and extend the program’s solvency.Many Americans claim benefits at age 62 due to financial need, health issues, or concerns about future cuts. However, doing so results in permanently reduced monthly payments. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), claiming benefits at 62 can result in up to a 30 per cent decrease, while delaying retirement until age 70 can significantly increase monthly payouts.A recent report from the Social Security Board of Trustees warns that the Social Security Trust Funds will have enough revenue to pay full benefits only until 2034. After that, without Congressional action, only 81 per cent of scheduled benefits would be payable. This could reduce the average monthly cheque from $1,976 to about $1,600.In 2024, trust fund reserves fell by $67 billion to $2.72 trillion, as program costs continued to exceed income. The funds have been running a deficit since 2010, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of social security.",The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security benefits in the United States will increase to 67 starting in 2026.

"Liquidity surplus alone doesn’t boost broad credit growth, economic activity holds greater influence: StanChart report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/liquidity-surplus-alone-doesnt-boost-broad-credit-growth-economic-activity-holds-greater-influence-stanchart-report/articleshow/122126052.cms,"Standard Chartered Bank (Image credits: IANS)

Credit growth in the economy is influenced more by overall economic activity than by the size of the liquidity surplus, according to a recent report by international bank Standard Chartered.The report said that while a high liquidity surplus may support growth in unsecured personal loans (excluding consumer durable loans), it does not necessarily lead to broad-based credit expansion.""Credit growth depends more on economic activity than the size of the liquidity surplus; however, unsecured personal loan growth (ex-consumer durables) could get a fillip on a large liquidity surplus,"" reported ANI quoting the report.It noted that credit growth, excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans, tends to slow down during times of excess liquidity. This points to real credit demand, which is closely tied to economic activity, being a stronger driver than the availability or cost of funds.The central banks often respond to slowing economic activity by increasing liquidity as a counter-cyclical measure. However, even with such efforts, overall credit (excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans) as a share of GDP has historically declined during times of high liquidity surplus.Citing one example, the report said that between December 2016 and September 2017, when liquidity surplus ranged between 2.6% and 3.3% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), credit (excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans) as a share of GDP fell from 48.9% to 46.2%. This downward trend continued until mid-2019.In contrast, unsecured personal loans (excluding consumer durables) have shown a strong upward trend over the past decade, with their share in GDP more than doubling to around 6%. This growth is driven by structural factors such as greater credit access and the rise of digital lending. However, the pace of expansion in this segment tends to pick up during periods of high liquidity.For instance, during March 2021 to March 2023, when liquidity conditions were relaxed, the share of unsecured personal loans in GDP rose faster than in previous similar periods, the report highlighted.","Credit growth depends more on economic activity than the size of the liquidity surplus. Unsecured personal loan growth (ex-consumer durables) could get a fillip on a large liquidity surplus, says Standard Chartered.

The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation focuses on reproductive health.

The Sherwood Foundation supports Nebraska-based nonprofits and early childhood education.

The Howard G Buffett Foundation works to address global hunger, human trafficking, and conflict resolution.

The NoVo Foundation advocates for marginalised girls, women and indigenous communities.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett donated $6 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock on Friday to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family-run charities. This marks his largest annual donation since he began giving away his fortune in 2006.The donation included about 12.36 million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway. Of that, 9.43 million shares went to the Gates Foundation, while 9,43,384 shares were donated to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. Three other foundations, led by Buffett’s children Howard, Susie, and Peter, each received 660,366 shares. These are the Howard G Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation, and the NoVo Foundation.With this latest donation, Buffett’s total charitable giving has now exceeded $60 billion. Despite the large gift, he still owns 13.8% of Berkshire’s stock, as per Reuters.Before Friday’s donation, Buffett’s net worth was estimated at $152 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. Following the donation, he is expected to rank sixth. This gift surpasses the $5.3 billion he gave away in June last year, and the $1.14 billion he donated to family charities in November.In a statement, Buffett reaffirmed that he does not plan to sell any Berkshire shares. Now 94, he has led Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway since 1965. The $1.05 trillion company owns nearly 200 businesses, including Geico and BNSF Railway, as well as large stakes in Apple and American Express.Last year, Buffett revised his will to leave 99.5% of his remaining fortune to a charitable trust after his death. The trust will be overseen by his three children, who will have about ten years to distribute the funds, and must decide together how the money is allocated. Buffett has previously said that donations to the Gates Foundation will stop after his death.","Warren Buffett donated $6 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock on Friday to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family-run charities.

Industrial profits in China fell sharply in May, reversing a brief recovery and highlighting growing challenges in the world’s second-largest economy. The decline reflects a slowdown in factory activity, mounting deflationary pressures, and persistent instability in trade relations with the United States.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday, quoted by Reuters, industrial profits dropped 9.1 per cent year-on-year in May, ending two consecutive months of growth. The slide comes amid weak domestic demand and continued stress in the property sector.NBS statistician Yu Weining attributed the contraction to ""insufficient effective demand, declining prices of industrial products and fluctuations in short-term factors.""In the first five months of 2025, industrial profits fell 1.1 per cent from a year earlier, following a 1.4 per cent rise recorded in the January-April period. The downturn coincides with the steepest factory-gate deflation China has experienced in nearly two years, as well as continued declines in consumer prices.Despite isolated signs of resilience, such as an unexpected uptick in retail sales in April, economists suggest more policy support is needed to strengthen what remains a fragile recovery.ANZ senior China strategist Xing Zhaopeng noted that commodity tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump have affected prices, while fierce domestic price competition has compressed manufacturers’ margins.The automotive sector, in particular, has come under strain. Sustained high US tariffs and aggressive pricing strategies have led Chinese authorities to intervene, urging manufacturers to halt price wars. Automotive dealers have complained about excessive inventory pressure, stating that manufacturers are oversupplying dealerships, which is eroding profitability and forcing some outlets to shut down.Feng Jianlin, chief economist at Beijing FOST Economic Consulting, said, ""The impact of overcapacity and falling prices on enterprises is still emerging, and efforts need to be made to adjust supply and stabilise demand.""A sectoral breakdown of the data revealed that state-owned enterprises saw profits decline by 7.4 per cent in the January-May period, while private sector firms posted a slight increase of 0.3 per cent.

Oil prices were on track for their biggest weekly decline since March 2023, as fears of supply disruptions from the Iran-Israel conflict faded, erasing any risk-driven premiums.As of 0637 GMT on Friday, Brent crude futures were up 36 cents, or 0.53 per cent, at $68.09 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 33 cents, or 0.51 per cent, to $65.57. Despite the modest intraday gains, both benchmarks were poised for a weekly drop of around 12 per cent, according to Reuters.Prices have now fallen back to levels seen before the escalation began on June 13, when Israel launched missiles at Iranian military and nuclear facilities. At the start of the week, prices had surged to a five-month high following US strikes on Iranian nuclear installations. However, markets reversed course after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, leading to a steep drop on Tuesday.Analysts noted the lack of a meaningful disruption to oil flows from the geopolitical tensions. ""Absent the threat of significant supply disruption, we still view oil as fundamentally oversupplied, with our 2025 balances indicating a roughly 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) surplus,"" Macquarie analysts said in a research note quoted by Reuters.The firm revised its WTI price forecast upward by $2, now expecting an average of $67 per barrel in 2025 and $60 in 2026, factoring in lingering geopolitical risks.Some support for prices emerged from US government data, which showed a decline in crude and fuel stockpiles last week, alongside a rise in refining activity and demand. ""The market is starting to digest the fact that crude oil inventories are very tight all of a sudden,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at the Price Futures Group.Additional bullish sentiment followed a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that President Trump is considering an early nomination for the next Federal Reserve chair.

US-China Trade Deal

US-China trade deal: Soon after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal, China has also confirmed that details have been finalized. China also said that United States will 'cancel a series of restrictive measures'.Earlier in the day, Trump said that the United States and China have reached a trade agreement. He also indicated an anticipated deal with India.According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's interview with Bloomberg TV, the agreement was finalized earlier this week, though specific details were not disclosed.""We just signed with China the other day,"" Trump said. Lutnick confirmed the agreement was ""signed and sealed"" two days prior.This development follows initial discussions in Geneva in early May, where both nations agreed to delay substantial tariff increases that threatened bilateral trade. Subsequent talks in London established a negotiation framework, with Trump's mentioned deal appearing to formalise these arrangements.Also Read | 'Very big one': Donald Trump hints India, US on cusp of 'great' trade deal; 10 things to know ""The president likes to close these deals himself. He's the dealmaker. We're going to have deal after deal,"" Lutnick said, according to an AP report.China disclosed earlier this week an acceleration in rare earth export approvals, crucial materials for high-technology products including electric vehicles. Beijing's export restrictions on rare earths have been a significant point of dispute.The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced Thursday that Beijing was expediting the review process for rare earth export licence applications and had approved several applications that met requirements.Export restrictions on minerals overshadowed tariffs during recent trade talks between Beijing and Washington, following China's implementation of licensing requirements for seven rare earth elements in April. This action potentially threatened to affect production of vehicles, robotics, wind turbines and advanced technological items in the United States and globally.The Geneva accord reached in May required both nations to reduce retaliatory tariff increases implemented during Trump's trade war escalation. However, certain elevated tariffs persist, including Washington's duties related to fentanyl trade and those on aluminium and steel.Also Read | Indian team in US for fresh talks on trade deal These dynamic policy changes are negatively impacting both leading global economies.The US economy declined at a 0.5 per cent annual rate from January through March, partially due to increased imports as businesses and consumers acquired foreign products before Trump's potential tariff implementation.Chinese manufacturing profits decreased by more than 9 per cent year-over-year in May, with automotive manufacturers experiencing significant losses. The January-May period showed a decline exceeding 1 per cent compared to the previous year.Trump and US officials expressed optimism about securing trade agreements with numerous countries, including India.""We're going to have deal after deal after deal,"" Lutnick said.","US President Donald Trump said that the United States and China have reached a trade agreement. China also said that United States will 'cancel a series of restrictive measures' This development follows initial discussions in Geneva in early May, where both nations agreed to delay substantial tariff increases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122107045,imgsize-54032,width-400,resizemode-4/122107045.jpg"

Chinese tech giant Xiaomi stunned the electric vehicle (EV) market on Thursday night after it received an overwhelming response to the launch of its new electric SUV, the YU7, clocking 289,000 pre-orders within the first hour of sales.The flood of demand sent the company’s Hong Kong-listed shares soaring to a record high, reinforcing Xiaomi's rapid rise in China's competitive EV sector.According to news agency AFP, Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun expressed astonishment at the unprecedented customer interest. “My goodness, in just two minutes, we received 196,000 paid pre-orders and 128,000 lock-in orders,” Lei said in a video following the launch.“We may be witnessing a miracle in China's automotive industry.”The YU7, a five-seater electric SUV, starts at 253,500 yuan (around $35,360), pricing it nearly 4% below Tesla’s Model Y in China. The sharp price point and Xiaomi’s aggressive feature set appear to have fueled the rapid pre-sale demand.The vehicle boasts a range of up to 760 kilometres on a single charge, significantly above the 719 kilometres advertised for Tesla’s extended-range Model Y.Reuters reported that the YU7's early orders surpassed market expectations of 100,000 and were more than triple the initial response to Xiaomi’s debut sedan, the SU7, launched last year. Analysts at Jefferies noted that while the YU7 is “slightly below” Tesla’s Model Y in price, it “offers much better specs and performance.”Citi analysts, as cited by Reuters, warned that Tesla may need to offer more incentives or even cut prices to keep pace with Xiaomi’s momentum.The YU7 also includes high-end tech features like Apple CarPlay, Apple Music support, and AI-enhanced driver-assist capabilities powered by Nvidia’s Thor chip. Despite being behind Tesla in full self-driving technology, Lei Jun claimed the YU7 beats the Model Y “on a range of metrics.”As per CNBC, the launch was originally planned for July but was moved up, possibly to capitalise on strong market momentum and an intensifying EV price war in China. The vehicle will begin deliveries within one to five weeks.Beyond cars, Xiaomi also launched AI-enabled smart glasses that can take photos, scan QR codes for payments, and perform real-time translations, positioning the brand against Meta’s Ray-Ban smart offerings. Priced at 1,999 yuan ($279), the glasses are currently available only in China.The launch comes at a critical time for China’s economy. Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin this week, highlighted EVs as a cornerstone of Beijing’s push to become a “major consumption powerhouse.” The Xiaomi launch aligns with that strategy, helping drive demand for high-value, tech-forward products.Following the overwhelming reception, Xiaomi’s stock jumped 8% in early trade before paring gains to end 3% higher.According to Reuters, its market capitalisation has now surpassed $200 billion, making it the best-performing large-cap stock in the Asia-Pacific region this year.","Xiaomi's new electric SUV, the YU7, received 289,000 pre-orders within the first hour of sales.

Tesla shake-up: Who is Omead Afshar? Senior executive reportedly fired by Elon Musk amid slumping sales in key markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-shake-up-who-is-omead-afshar-senior-executive-reportedly-fired-by-elon-musk-amid-slumping-sales-in-key-markets/articleshow/122103380.cms,"File photo: Omead Afshar (left) and Elon Musk (Picture credit: X, ANI)

Who is Omead Afshar?

Omead Afshar, one of Elon Musk ’s closest aides and Tesla’s vice president of manufacturing and operations, has been reportedlyfired by Musk as the electric vehicle maker grapples with declining sales across North America and Europe.According to CNBC, Afshar’s termination comes just days before the end of the second quarter, amid ongoing pressure from investors following Tesla’s fifth consecutive monthly sales drop in Europe and a 15% decline in deliveries in China.Afshar’s dismissal marks the latest high-profile exit from Tesla following the recent departure of Milan Kovac, head of the company’s Optimus humanoid robotics program.Afshar had been leading a critical team overseeing Tesla’s business across major markets, including executives in sales and policy.His ouster comes at a time when Tesla’s brand has also taken a reputational hit, partly due to Musk’s controversial political positions and the underperformance of the Cybertruck. Analysts are forecasting a global drop of at least 10% in Tesla’s Q2 deliveries. The stock is down 19% this year.Often described as “Musk’s fixer,” Afshar was one of the most powerful and trusted executives within Elon Musk’s business empire.According to Forbes, he began his journey with Tesla as an engineer in 2011 and rose through the ranks to eventually become vice president, overseeing operations in North America and Europe.An American citizen born to Iranian parents, Afshar studied biomedical engineering with a focus on mechanical engineering at the University of California, Irvine.Known for his perfectionism and operational discipline, Afshar gained Musk’s trust early on and became involved in some of Tesla’s most high-stakes projects.He played a key role in building Tesla’s massive Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, a project that solidified his reputation for delivering under pressure.In 2022, he was the subject of an internal probe over the acquisition of rare construction materials, including speciality glass, for a secretive Musk-led initiative, as reported by Bloomberg.Following that investigation, he worked briefly at SpaceX, where he was later promoted to vice president before returning to Tesla.Afshar also had a hand in Musk’s 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now known as X. According to ET, he helped implement cost-cutting measures during the platform’s restructuring.Despite his abrupt firing, Afshar continued praising Musk on social media in recent days, calling the robotaxi pilot launch in Austin “absolutely historic” and thanking the CEO “for pushing us all.”His influence was such that The Wall Street Journal once described him as one of the few insiders who could both understand and execute Musk’s most ambitious visions.","Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, has been reportedly fired by Elon Musk.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

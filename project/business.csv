Spirit Airlines announced on Thursday its decision to furlough 365 pilots and downgrade the status of up to 170 pilots in the first quarter of 2026, as part of a broader workforce reduction strategy amid ongoing restructuring efforts.The ultra-low-cost carrier, which filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year this past August, informed the pilots' union of its intention to cut $100 million in annual pilot-related expenses to preserve cash reserves, reported Reuters. ""In line with our ongoing restructuring, we are implementing further measures to align staffing levels with our previously announced capacity reductions and a smaller operating fleet,"" Spirit Airlines stated.Chief operating officer John Bendoraitis, in a memo obtained by Reuters, indicated that the number of furloughs might decrease in the coming weeks due to voluntary attrition. The company plans to open the bid process at the end of November.Currently, Spirit Airlines employs approximately 2,400 pilots. The airline had previously furloughed around 330 pilots and is set to furlough an additional 270 in November. Additionally, Spirit plans to furlough about 1,800 flight attendants, representing roughly one-third of its cabin crew, effective December 1.The Florida-based airline also announced impending reductions across its corporate teams and intends to make staffing adjustments at its maintenance stations based on volume. The carrier will also close its maintenance stations and warehouse operations in Baltimore and Chicago, effective January 1, 2026.In a recent filing, Spirit Airlines projected that the furloughs would save the company $211 million. The airline anticipates incurring losses of $804 million in 2025 and stated that its transformation plan aims to return to profitability by 2027, necessitating a network reduction in 2026.","Spirit Airlines announced on Thursday its decision to furlough 365 pilots and downgrade the status of up to 170 pilots in the first quarter of 2026.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their rally for the third consecutive week driven by strong global cues and encouraging business updates from several companies. Positive start to the Q2FY26 earning sessions also supported by positive momentum. Dovish remarks from the Fed Chair on interest rates and indications of a possible pause in quantitative tightening, which buoyed global risk sentiment. Lower CPI and WPI data in India also boosted rate cut expectations in India.Nifty traded in a range in the first two trading sessions of the week. However, it gained momentum as the week progressed and rallied to three months high on Thursday. Index in the process generated a breakout above a falling supply line joining the major highs of September 2024 and June 2025 signaling strength and continuation of the up move.On the smaller time frame Nifty has generated a breakout above the last three months symmetrical triangular consolidation pattern highlighting positive bias and any dips should be used as a buying opportunity.We expect the index to head towards 25,900 and then towards 26,200 levels in the coming weeks being the 123.6% and 138.2% external retracement of the last three months' corrective decline (25669-24338).On the downside immediate support is placed at 25350-25400 levels being the recent breakout area while key support is placed at 25100-25,000 levels being the current week low and 20- & 50-days EMA.Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows. The index has also witnessed a breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern — a strong bullish reversal setup — reinforcing the positive trend.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty in the current leg of up move, with key private banking heavy weights Q2FY26 results lined up on coming Saturday. It will decide the next directional trigger for the index.With prices holding above key moving averages, the near-term bias remains upward. The index is likely to test our target of 58,000, being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous up move (53561-55835) as projected from the recent trough of 54226. Thursday's gap area of 56,700 will act as immediate support for the index.The RSI (14) at 66 indicates healthy momentum, suggesting strength in the uptrend. Any dips should be viewed as buying opportunities within this constructive setup.Reliance Industries' stock has undergone a corrective phase over the past three months and is currently consolidating near a crucial support zone. This technical setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, positioning the stock for a potential bullish reversal and the next leg of the uptrend.A key technical takeaway from the weekly chart of Reliance Industries is the time-price relationship, where the stock has taken 13 weeks to retrace merely 50% of the preceding 13-week rally from ₹1115 to ₹1551. This shallow and time-consuming retracement reflects inherent strength and a bullish undertone. The recent corrective phase is interpreted as a higher base formation, setting the stage for the next impulsive leg on the upside.The ongoing corrective phase appears to be nearing exhaustion, with price action indicating the potential for a fresh bullish reversal. We anticipate the stock to resume its primary uptrend and retest the previous swing highs around ₹1540 in the upcoming quarters, which correspond to the key resistance zones marked by the September 2024 and July 2025 peaks.Suzlon stands to be a prime beneficiary of India’s renewable energy expansion, with wind capacity projected to rise from 49.8 GW in 2024 to 127.9 GW by 2033. The company’s leadership in domestic manufacturing and a record firm orderbook of 5.7 GW as of Q1 FY26 provide multi-year revenue visibility and execution certainty. Recent marquee orders from Tata Power Renewable and Sunsure Energy reaffirm Suzlon’s strong demand pipeline, while the steady contribution from its high-margin O&M business adds stability and predictable cash flows to its earnings profile.Further strengthening its strategic position, Suzlon’s acquisition of a 76% stake in Renom Energy Services unlocks access to the large non-Suzlon O&M market, enhancing scale and profitability through cross-selling and synergies. The company’s calibrated capex of ₹400–450 crore, with a strong R&D focus, is set to drive innovation and operating leverage through efficient, export-ready turbine designs. Overall, Suzlon’s integrated model, improving margin mix, and balance of growth and annuity revenues underpin a constructive long-term investment outlook.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 17, 2025 are Reliance Industries, and Suzlon Energy.

Gold soared to record levels as renewed concerns over US credit quality and escalating US-China tensions drove investors toward safe-haven assets.Gold surged 1.2 per cent to $4,379.93 per ounce on Friday, heading for its biggest weekly gain since 2008 and extending a rally that began in August. The surge was underpinned by expectations of steep Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, which also lifted other precious metals.Meanwhile, Silver also breached its 1980 record on a discontinued Chicago Board of Trade contract, touching $54.38 an ounce before stabilising, as reported by Bloomberg. Palladium and platinum also posted substantial weekly advances.Gold has jumped more than 65 per cent this year, buoyed by central bank buying, ETF inflows, and geopolitical uncertainty. Silver has risen nearly 90 per cent, driven by similar factors and a major supply squeeze in London that pushed benchmark prices above New York futures.More than 15 million ounces of silver were withdrawn from Comex-linked warehouses in recent days, reportedly to ease tightness in London. The price gap between the two markets has narrowed to 70 cents per ounce from $3 earlier.As of 7:57 a.m. in Singapore, spot gold was up 1 per cent at $4,369.14 per ounce, bringing its weekly gain to 8.7 per cent.Platinum rose 8 per cent this week, and palladium surged 16 per cent.Market sentiment turned volatile on Thursday after two US regional banks disclosed loan irregularities involving fraud allegations, sparking fresh concerns about borrower stability. The developments, alongside heightened US-China trade tensions and limited economic data amid the Washington shutdown, fuelled safe-haven demand.Investors are increasingly pricing in aggressive rate reductions by year-end, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled another quarter-point cut this month — a backdrop favouring non-yielding assets like gold and silver.Additionally, china’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao blamed Washington for recent diplomatic strains, warning against economic decoupling. His remarks followed US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s criticism of a Chinese trade official’s surprise Washington visit as “unhinged”.","Gold surged 1.2 per cent to $4,379.93 per ounce on Friday, heading for its biggest weekly gain since 2008.

Mumbai: Anantam Highways Trust, an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) that listed on the bourses on Thursday, saw unusual debut-day trading. Some investors bought the units of the InvIT at Rs 114 on BSE and Rs 113 on the NSE, an appreciation of 13-14% over its IPO price.Here’s why that is odd: Unlike shares, InvIT units are considered debt instruments for investment purposes and a return (yield) of 13-14% means a return of more than double the one-year bank FD rates in just a week’s time.Market players said the unusual buying price and the return could be due to the current IPO frenzy when some investors confused the InvIT units as stocks and unknowingly pushed up prices of the instrument.Issued at Rs 100 per unit in the recently closed IPO, the units of Anantam InvITs were listed at Rs 103, a decent listing for a debt instrument. After the unusual spike, the units closed the session at Rs 105, a good listing-day gain, market players said.The trust issued units worth Rs 400 crore in the IPO, at a price band of Rs 98-100 per unit.

Mumbai: Renewed optimism about strong corporate results for the July-Sept quarter (Q3FY26), good sales during the ongoing festive season, and a slowing trend in offloading of shares by foreign funds helped sensex rally over 900 points in mid-session Thursday. The index finally settled 862 points up, at 83,468 points—less than 1% from its peak this year at 84,100 points, recorded on June 30.

"Recovery signs: Eternal, Nestle sales grow in Q2",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/recovery-signs-eternal-nestle-sales-grow-in-q2/articleshow/124618026.cms,"



Mumbai: Consumer firms Eternal (formerly Zomato) and Nestle India recorded a revenue surge in the Sept quarter, signalling a gradual recovery in demand that had been sluggish for several quarters on the back of tepid urban spending. Net profits for the firms, however, declined on a year-on-year basis even though they rose sequentially.Eternal’s revenue from operations increased to Rs 13,590 crore in Q2 from Rs 4,799 crore in the year-ago period on a consolidated basis, translating into a growth of over 100%, largely due to its quick commerce business Blinkit, which delivered a 10-quarter high net order value in Q2. Growth of the food delivery segment is also recovering after five slow quarters although it expects revival to happen only gradually. Net profits declined to Rs 65 crore from Rs 176 crore on higher investments in Blinkit.FMCG major Nestle delivered domestic sales of Rs 5,411 crore on a standalone basis, the highest ever recorded in any quarter helped by robust volume growth. “Three out of four product groups delivered strong volume-led double-digit growth,” said new CMD Manish Tiwary. Net profits dropped to Rs 753 crore in the quarter from Rs 986 crore in the year ago period, partly due to high commodity costs that weighed on margins. Nestle’s stock ended higher on BSE while Eternal’s share price fell.","Eternal’s revenue from operations increased to Rs 13,590 crore in Q2 from Rs 4,799 crore in the year-ago period.

"At $7bn, Zepto valuation rises 40% in a year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/at-7bn-zepto-valuation-rises-40-in-a-year/articleshow/124618018.cms,".





Mumbai: Zepto has raised $450 million in a pre-IPO funding round led by US pension fund Calpers at a valuation of $7 billion. Its valuation has jumped about 40% from $5 billion just over a year ago.At $7 billion, Zepto ranks among the country’s most valued startups such as Razorpay, and IPO-bound Groww, which are valued at similar levels. The quick commerce player’s value surpasses that of older startups like Meesho ($5 billion at its peak). Zepto’s domestic ownership after this funding stands close to 40%, sources said. Homegrown Flipkart, now owned by Walmart remains the biggest unlisted startup with a valuation exceeding $30 billion.The fundraise, which includes a mix of primary and secondary transactions, has also been backed by existing investors General Catalyst, Avenir, Lightspeed, Stepstone and Goodwater.About $300 million has been raised by way of primary capital, sources said, which means that the money directly went into the company’s coffers. Zepto issued a statement on Thursday detailing the funding amount but did not disclose additional details.Calpers has joined the firm’s cap table (new investor) through the latest investment.Motilal Oswal and Raamdeo Agrawal, founders of Motilal Oswal Financial Services and a few other investors purchased stakes in the company through secondary transactions as part of the round earlier this year. In a secondary deal, a company’s shares change hands among investors.Even as big-ticket funding has been eluding the broader startup space with very few cheques above $100-200 million coming in, Zepto has been on a capital-raising spree of sorts as investors rushed to get a slice of the quick commerce market amid growing consumer appetite for 10-minute deliveries. Zepto which rivals Swiggy’s Instamart, Eternal’s Blinkit and Tata’s BigBasket projected to grow by over 40% annually until 2030 had bagged over $1 billion in funding last year touching a valuation of $5 billion. The company had turned unicorn in Aug 2023 after investors infused over $200 million into the firm at a valuation of $1.4 billion. Zepto is preparing for a public listing sometime next year and is in the process of drafting its draft IPO papers.","At $7 billion, Zepto ranks among the country’s most valued startups such as Razorpay, and IPO-bound Groww, which are valued at similar levels.

Markets regulator Sebi is taking steps to enhance institutional participation in both agricultural and non-agricultural commodity markets, aiming to make them more appealing for hedging activities, its chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Thursday, PTI reported.Speaking at the Bloomberg Forum for Investment Management, Pandey said, “We are looking to enhance institutional participation to make this market more attractive for hedging.” He added that deepening India’s cash equities market and improving the derivatives segment remain high priorities.The Sebi chief emphasised that any further measures to strengthen commodity markets would be consultative and carefully designed. Last month, he had indicated plans to engage with the government to allow banks, insurance companies, and pension funds to invest in non-agricultural commodity derivative markets.Pandey also highlighted that Sebi is examining proposals to permit foreign portfolio investors to trade in non-cash-settled, non-agricultural commodity derivative contracts.Beyond commodities, the regulator has taken steps to deepen the corporate bond market, making it more accessible for issuers and investors. Sebi is also considering bond derivatives and encouraging the growth of municipal bonds through regulatory reforms and targeted outreach programmes.","Markets regulator Sebi is taking steps to enhance institutional participation in both agricultural and non-agricultural commodity markets.

Gold prices are likely to stay firm amid global uncertainty, with the dollar and rupee expected to trade in narrow ranges as tariff tensions and geopolitical risks keep markets volatile, Director of Commodities and Currencies at Anand Rathi, Naveen Mathur, said in an interview with ET.He noted that the dollar index, which touched a three-month high of 99.56 on October 9 before easing to 98.92, remains up about 1.28% week-on-week. The recent movement, Mathur said, was driven by a weaker euro following political shifts in France and a dovish stance from Japan, which pushed the yen lower. “I expect high volatility to continue, with the dollar index likely trading between 96–97 on the downside and 99–100 on the upside, though breaching 100 seems unlikely this week,” he added.According to Mathur, the ongoing US government shutdown and renewed tariff concerns with China are weighing on the dollar, even as other global currencies show weakness. “Political developments in Japan and France have influenced recent trends. The shutdown and trade uncertainties will keep the market volatile,” he said.The rupee, meanwhile, has been showing signs of stability. Mathur said the Reserve Bank of India appears to be intervening actively to keep the currency steady.“The central bank seems comfortable with the rupee trading around Rs 87–88 per dollar, where it can maintain some stability. I expect the rupee to move in a narrow band between Rs 87.50 and Rs 88.50, with limited depreciation beyond 88.50,” he explained, quoted ET.On bullion, Mathur said both gold and silver have gained strongly this year, supported by safe-haven demand and festive buying. “The ongoing uncertainty around trade tariffs, especially between the US and China, continues to support gold. If the dollar weakens slightly, it would further boost dollar-denominated commodities like gold,” he said. With the rupee unlikely to appreciate much, domestic gold prices should remain firm through the festive season.Silver prices, which recently broke past their 2011 highs, continue to reflect a tight supply scenario. “Silver has surpassed $50 per ounce internationally and touched around Rs 1,53,400 per kg on October 9 in India,” Mathur said. He added that global production has been running at a deficit for four to five years, and inventories at the London Metal Exchange have nearly halved since the start of 2025.“Both gold and silver have strong fundamental support from supply constraints, safe-haven demand, ETF inflows, and central-bank buying,” he said, though he expects short-term corrections as traders book profits.For traders, Mathur recommends a buy-on-dips strategy:Mathur also noted that both metals remain in a positive long-term trend. “Corrections are healthy and offer fresh buying opportunities for investors looking to ride the next leg of the rally,” he said.","Gold prices likely to stay firm amid global uncertainty, with the dollar and rupee expected to trade in narrow ranges.

"UAE braces for rain, dust, and cooler temperatures: Unstable weather expected from Oct 10-14",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-braces-for-rain-dust-and-cooler-temperatures-unstable-weather-expected-from-oct-10-14/articleshow/124447205.cms,"From October 10-14, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain are expected to experience light to moderate rain and dust/ Representative Image





Residents in several parts of the UAE are being advised to brace for rainy weather, lower temperatures, and dusty winds between Friday, October 10, and Tuesday, October 14, as a shifting weather system moves through the region, primarily affecting the northern and eastern areas.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast a period of unstable weather conditions starting Friday, October 10, through Tuesday, October 14, due to the influence of an extended surface low-pressure system from the south and an upper-level low carrying relatively cold and humid air. These upper-level low-pressure systems tend to intensify with altitude and are typically linked with cloud development and rainfall.During this five-day stretch, weather models indicate that areas most likely to experience rain include Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain, while major coastal cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are expected to remain largely dry. The Windy app projects the rain will begin on Sunday. Forecasts describe the expected rainfall as light to moderate overall, with some areas experiencing heavy rain intermittently. This weather activity is expected to affect primarily the northern and eastern regions, with the potential to extend inland and toward some western areas.There is also a limited chance of hailstones forming in certain locations.In addition to rain, a noticeable drop in temperatures is expected across several affected regions. Windy conditions may intensify at times, potentially kicking up dust and sand. These conditions may reduce visibility in some areas and could affect outdoor plans, especially during the weekend. Sea conditions are also likely to be impacted, with wave activity in both the Arabian Gulf and the Oman Sea ranging from slight to moderate, occasionally becoming rough.September and October are typically among the most humid months of the year in the UAE, with humidity sometimes reaching 100 percent. However, this year has seen relatively drier conditions leading up to this weather shift. With forecasts predicting a cooler, wetter period, residents and travelers are advised to monitor updates and plan accordingly.","From October 10-14, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain are expected to experience light to moderate rain and dust.

Sfeer Loyalty Program: A community-centric approach

Hafawa Lounge: Riyadh Air’s first premium ground experience

Strategic significance: Vision 2030 and the aviation push









Saudi Arabia’s newest national airline, Riyadh Air, is preparing for a strategic soft launch of its first international route — daily flights between Riyadh and London Heathrow — beginning October 26, 2025. While tickets won’t be publicly available yet, this tightly managed rollout marks a crucial proving phase as the airline gears up for full-scale commercial operations in 2026.Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a future global aviation leader, with this initial route serving not only as a testbed for systems, aircraft, and service procedures, but also as a key milestone in the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy.Riyadh Air’s first operational route will connect King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with London Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest and most tightly controlled hubs. But these initial flights won’t be open for general ticket sales. Instead, the seats will be available exclusively to Riyadh Air employees, staff at the airline’s owner — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) — and their families.The reason for this controlled opening is strategic. While the airline secured a pair of coveted Heathrow slots back in June for the Northern Hemisphere winter season, it does not yet have its own aircraft. Riyadh Air’s order with Boeing for 72 Dreamliners — 39 firm orders for the 787-9 model and 33 options — originally targeted first deliveries by December 2024. That schedule has now been pushed back due to production delays, with the first jets now expected in late 2025.To avoid losing the Heathrow slots under the airport’s strict “use it or lose it” rules, Riyadh Air is launching the route using a leased Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Oman Air. The aircraft, named Jamila and registered as HZ-RXX, is currently being used for pilot training, certification flights, and operational trials.Passengers on these early flights will be considered “Launch Members” and will be invited to share detailed feedback on every part of the journey — from booking and boarding to in-flight experience and ground handling. Tickets for these flights will only be available through the airline’s newly unveiled loyalty platform, Sfeer.Speaking at the official announcement, Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas made it clear that this staged approach is a deliberate choice, not a compromise.“If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won’t,” he said. “So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.”The new Riyadh–London route spans 3,070 miles with a flight time of approximately 7 hours, making Riyadh Air the fourth airline to operate on this corridor.While Saudia currently maintains a strong presence on the route, it is gradually withdrawing from Riyadh-based services to make way for Riyadh Air, which will become the Kingdom's flagship international airline.Though Riyadh Air is just beginning operations, its long-term ambitions are substantial. The airline was officially announced in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a cornerstone of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, an economic diversification plan that seeks to position Riyadh as a global business and tourism hub.Riyadh Air plans to serve over 100 destinations worldwide by 2030, supported by a modern, fuel-efficient fleet and a focus on premium service across every touchpoint. The scale of its ambition is reflected in its extensive aircraft order book:Riyadh Air’s expansion plans are backed by a massive and diversified aircraft order portfolio:This strategic mix aims to equip the airline with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet for both regional and long-haul destinations.Following the launch of its first route to London, Riyadh Air’s next confirmed destination will be Dubai International Airport. The Riyadh–Dubai corridor is among the busiest in the region, with more than 30 daily flights at peak times, operated by a mix of low-cost and full-service carriers. This route will also mark Riyadh Air’s first direct competition with Emirates, which currently operates three daily Boeing 777-300ER services on the same sector.In parallel, Riyadh Air has been forming strategic partnerships to expand its global reach, including a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore potential codesharing and loyalty program alignment.Alongside the launch announcement, Riyadh Air introduced Sfeer, a digital-first loyalty program designed to reflect modern user behavior and local cultural values. The name — which means “ambassador” in Arabic and echoes the English word “sphere” — captures the program’s vision of building a connected and collaborative member community.Unlike traditional airline programs that reward individual travel spend, Sfeer promotes engagement, inclusivity, and shared progress. Members can share level points with family and friends, advancing together toward higher tiers — a model the airline says reflects Saudi values of generosity and togetherness.In its early access phase, Sfeer is open to Riyadh Air’s internal community, but it will be expanded in phases. Early registrants, dubbed “Founders,” will gain priority access to ticket sales on upcoming flights and invitations to exclusive events. When fully launched in 2026, the program will include gamified challenges, member leaderboards, and a no-expiry points policy. Additional benefits will include complimentary onboard Wi-Fi and special partner offers.Douglas positioned Sfeer as a loyalty program that goes beyond points.“We’re emphasizing inclusivity and engagement, rather than the individual transactional models of traditional airline loyalty programs,” he said. “We want this to be community-driven and digitally immersive — not just another points system.”Riyadh Air has also unveiled its first premium lounge, the ‘Hafawa Lounge’ — located between Terminals 1 and 2 at King Khalid International Airport.The lounge is positioned as an extension of Riyadh Air’s commitment to providing a luxury experience and serves as part of its overall operational trial period. As the airline ramps up toward full public service, every touchpoint, from lounge to inflight, is being tested and refined.Riyadh Air was established in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 — the national strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing reliance on oil. The airline’s objectives are closely aligned with the broader ambitions of its owner, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which include transforming Riyadh into a global aviation hub, attracting 330 million passengers annually by 2030, and enhancing international connectivity through strategic partnerships.One such partnership includes a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore future code-sharing agreements and potential loyalty program integration. Riyadh Air forms just one part of the PIF’s expansive investments in the aviation ecosystem, which also span airports, logistics, and supporting infrastructure across the Kingdom.","Riyadh Air will launch its first London flights on October 26 using a leased Boeing 787-9 for staff only.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH





US Chamber of Commerce took legal action against the government’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions on Thursday, saying the move violates existing immigration law.In its complaint, the Chamber argued that the new fee goes beyond the limits set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires visa charges to reflect only the government’s administrative costs. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer, said the steep fee would make it nearly impossible for many US employers, especially start-ups and small businesses to hire skilled foreign workers.""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utiliSe the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the US,"" Bradley said, as per an official release by the US Chamber of Commerce.Bradley also noted that while president Trump’s administration has prioritised border security and economic growth, the Chamber believed the US economy still needed skilled workers to sustain expansion.He said the Chamber supports targeted immigration reforms that simplify the visa process and help retain global talent in the country.""President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,"" it said.The organisation added that it is willing to work with Congress and the administration to create a fairer and more practical system for employers who depend on the H-1B programme.","US Chamber of Commerce took legal action against the government’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions on Thursday.

Jamie Dimon’s View on Gold





Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO, who is long known to be a skeptic on gold investment, has said that he now sees a ‘semi-rational’ in having the yellow metal as part of your investment portfolio.Gold prices have surged significantly, rising from under $2,000 two years ago to remarkable levels, outperforming equity markets in the 21st century. This upward trend reflects investors seeking refuge in secure assets, driven by inflationary pressures and global political tensions.While stating that he is not a buying of gold, Dimon acknowledged that gold prices could go up to as high as $10,000! ""I'm not a gold buyer — it costs 4% to own it,"" Dimon said this week at Fortune's Most Powerful Women conference in Washington.Dimon expressed a measured view on gold ownership whilst acknowledging its potential value in current circumstances.""It could easily go to $5,000, $10,000 in environments like this. This is one of the few times in my life it's semi-rational to have some in your portfolio,” he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.""Asset prices are kind of high,"" Dimon said, and ""in the back of my mind, that cuts across almost everything at this point.""Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel, expressed concern last week about investors increasingly perceiving gold as a more stable alternative to the dollar, describing this shift as ""really concerning.""Goldman Sachs has adjusted its gold price prediction for December 2026 upwards to $4,900 per ounce, an increase from the previous $4,300, attributing this change to significant Western ETF investments and anticipated central bank purchases.""We see the risks to our upgraded gold price forecast as still skewed to the upside on net, because private sector diversification into the relatively small gold market may boost ETF holdings above our rates-implied estimate,"" Goldman said according to a Reuters report.HSBC has increased its projected average gold price for 2025 to $3,355 per ounce from $3,215, attributing the rise to heightened safe-haven interest amidst global political tensions, financial instability, and declining US dollar strength.""Sentiment remains bullish as rallies are expected to continue in 2026 aided by official sector buying and institutional demand for gold as a diversifier,"" the bank stated in a note dated October 15.HSBC revised its gold price projection upward, setting a new average target of $3,950 for 2026, an increase from its previous estimate of $3,125.ANZ's latest analysis predicts gold prices will reach $4,400 per ounce by end-2025, citing several factors including heightened geopolitical tensions, economic instability, financial market uncertainties, and anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate reductions.The bank expects gold valuations to achieve their highest point around $4,600 per ounce in June 2026, before trending downward in the latter half of 2026, coinciding with the end of the Federal Reserve's easing programme and increased certainty regarding US economic expansion and trade policy directions.","Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO, has said that he now sees a ‘semi- rational’ in having the yellow metal as part of your investment portfolio.

Mortgage trends: US 30-year rate slips to 6.27% this week; housing sales remain sluggish,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mortgage-trends-us-30-year-rate-slips-to-6-27-this-week-housing-sales-remain-sluggish/articleshow/124609992.cms,"



The average long-term US mortgage rate declined again this week, hovering just above its lowest level for 2025, as easing Treasury yields and Federal Reserve rate expectations continued to bring relief to borrowers, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.Freddie Mac said on Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage slipped to 6.27% from 6.3% last week. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.44%, AP reported. The current level is just above 6.26%, last seen four weeks ago after a steady run of declines pushed borrowing costs to their lowest since early October 2024.Rates on 15-year fixed mortgages, often used by homeowners refinancing existing loans, also edged lower — dropping to 5.52% from 5.53% a week earlier. A year ago, the average stood at 5.63%, Freddie Mac said.Mortgage rates typically mirror movements in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a benchmark for home loan pricing. The 10-year yield was 4.02% at midday Thursday, down from 4.14% a week ago.Rates have been sliding since July, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in a year amid concerns about the weakening US job market.At their September meeting, Fed officials projected two more cuts this year and one in 2026. However, the central bank could shift its stance if inflation rises again, especially as the Trump administration expands tariff measures and trade tensions with China intensify.Analysts noted that further Fed rate cuts don’t necessarily translate into lower mortgage rates. “Last fall, after the Fed cut its rate for the first time in more than four years, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually reaching just above 7% in January this year,” Freddie Mac said.The average 30-year mortgage rate has remained above 6% since September 2022, when borrowing costs began rising sharply from record lows. The US housing market has struggled since then, with home sales remaining subdued.Sales of previously occupied homes in the US fell last year to their lowest level in nearly three decades, and so far in 2025, volumes continue to lag behind year-ago levels, signalling continued weakness in housing demand despite easing rates.","The average long-term US mortgage rate declined again this week, hovering just above its lowest level for 2025.

US stocks ticked higher on Thursday as technology shares rallied following signs of strong demand in the artificial-intelligence (AI) sector. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 116 points or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5%, though markets remained choppy throughout the week, AP reported.Tech stocks led gains after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) reported a larger-than-expected profit for the latest quarter. CFO Wendell Huang said the company anticipates “continued strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies” through the end of the year. TSMC, a key chipmaker for AI companies including Nvidia, saw its Taiwan-listed shares climb 1.4%, while its US-listed stock slipped 0.2%.Nvidia rose 1.3%, emerging as the top contributor to the S&P 500 rally, reflecting its position as Wall Street’s most valuable stock. Analysts warn that the surge in AI stocks has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, even as inflation remains high and the job market slows.Salesforce jumped 8% after announcing plans to deliver over 10% compounded annual revenue growth in coming years, helping lift the Dow.Freight company J.B. Hunt Transport Services soared 17.3% after exceeding third-quarter profit expectations. These gains offset a 4% drop for Travelers, whose profits beat forecasts but revenue fell short. Hewlett Packard Enterprise fell 8.8% after setting long-term financial targets that analysts considered modest.Global markets also saw broad gains. South Korea’s Kospi surged 2.5% amid optimism over a potential US-Seoul trade deal, with Samsung Electronics and automakers Hyundai Motor and Kia leading the rally. Chinese indexes edged up 0.1% in Shanghai but fell 0.1% in Hong Kong as trade tensions with the US lingered.In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.04% from 4.05% late Wednesday. A report showed that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly contracted, offering a limited view of economic conditions as the Federal Reserve weighs inflation against a slowing labour market.Market updates have also been disrupted by the US government shutdown, delaying key economic releases including weekly unemployment claims and inflation data that typically guide trading on Wall Street.","The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 116 points, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5%.

"LVMH shares soar 14% on strong China demand: European luxury stocks adds $80 bn, investors cheer sector revival",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lvmh-shares-soar-14-on-strong-china-demand-european-luxury-stocks-adds-80-bn-investors-cheer-sector-revival/articleshow/124602731.cms,"



Shares of luxury giant LVMH had their best day in over two decades on Wednesday, soaring as much as 14% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly sales that signalled a possible revival in Chinese demand. The rally added nearly $80 billion to the combined market value of European luxury stocks, according to Reuters report.The world’s largest luxury group, which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moët, and Hennessy, posted its first quarterly sales rise this year, beating forecasts and sparking a sector-wide surge. Rivals including Hermès, Kering, Richemont, Burberry, and Moncler gained between 5% and 9% as investors cheered signs that the industry may be pulling out of its two-year slump.“The sales figures indeed surprised investors positively and are likely to keep the sector’s share price momentum alive,” said Stefan Bauknecht, equity portfolio manager at DWS. Analysts at Bernstein noted that sales exceeded expectations across all divisions — from fashion and jewellery to spirits and hospitality.While optimism is returning, several analysts cautioned against reading too much into the rebound.Jefferies noted that it was “too early to talk about a general recovery” and questioned whether early signs from LVMH were being mistaken for an industry-wide turnaround.According to Reuters calculations, the LVMH-led rally added roughly $80 billion in market capitalisation to companies in the STOXX Europe Luxury 10 index — the biggest such jump since early 2024. The gains come amid hopes that sweeping creative and management changes at top brands will begin to pay off.Sales in mainland China — a key growth engine for global luxury — turned positive, with consumers responding well to immersive retail concepts such as Louis Vuitton’s ship-shaped boutique in Shanghai. Sales from travelling Chinese shoppers also improved, though they remained lower than last year.Chinese demand, which accounts for nearly one-third of global luxury sales, had been hit hard by the property downturn, US trade tensions, and economic uncertainty.Ariane Hayate, European equity fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild, said the third-quarter performance was “reassuring”, citing “idiosyncratic” growth factors such as Louis Vuitton’s initiatives in China. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division — its core profit driver — improved sequentially but still recorded a 2% year-on-year decline.LVMH Chief Financial Officer Cecile Cabanis said on Tuesday that “economic uncertainty and unfavourable exchange rates” would continue to affect the group’s performance in the fourth quarter. UBS forecasts a 4% organic sales growth for the sector next year, expecting momentum to pick up only in the second half of 2026 as new designer collections reach stores.","Shares of luxury giant LVMH had their best day in over two decades on Wednesday, soaring as much as 14% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly sales.

While reacting to US President Donald Trump's remark, Russian ambassador Denis Alipov said that India's decisions on oil imports are guided by its ""national interests."" Earlier on Wednesday, Trump had said that PM Modi assured him that New Delhi will stop buying oil from Moscow.When asked whether India will continue importing Russian oil, Alipov said, ""This is the question for the Indian government. The Indian Government is having in mind the national interest of this country in the first place, and our cooperation in energy is very much in tune with those interests.""His remarks came after India reaffirmed its independent approach to energy sourcing after Trump's remark on PM Modi. ""Russian oil is important for the Indian economy,"" Russian ambassador Denis Alipov told reporters.The statement also stressed that Russia would not interfere in India-US relations but underlined the long-standing bilateral ties between Delhi and Moscow.""India-Russia relationship has always been equal, uninterrupted and mutually beneficial, qualities that make its upward trajectory irreversible,"" Alipov said.""India and the US are independent in their decisions, and we do not interfere in those issues.Our oil supplies are very beneficial for the Indian economy and the welfare of the Indian people,"" he added.Trump, who has repeatedly criticised India for purchasing Russian crude, told reporters at White House on Wednesday (local time) that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him India would stop buying oil from Russia.US has long pushed India to halt these purchases, arguing that discounted Russian oil helps fund Moscow's war in Ukraine.India, meanwhile, on Thursday emphasised that its energy policies are guided by national interests and the need to protect consumers amid global volatility.""It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective,"" the external affairs ministry said in a statement after Trump's remark.""Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy.

Organic sales growth, however, was 3.3%, largely driven by price increases of 2.8%.The Swiss multinational, which owns over 2,000 brands, including Nespresso, Perrier, Kit Kat, and Purina, has faced turbulence in recent months.

Asian markets edged higher on Thursday as investors weighed escalating tensions in the US-China trade war alongside expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates this year.The region’s gains follow a broadly positive session on Wall Street and mark a second consecutive day of recovery, as traders focused on softer US economic data and central bank signals that may favour further monetary easing.Markets have been volatile this week after US President Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods in retaliation for Beijing’s new rare-earth export controls.When asked about the possibility of a prolonged trade conflict, Trump bluntly told reporters, “Well, you’re in one now… We have a 100 percent tariff. If we didn’t have tariffs, we would be exposed as being a nothing.”Despite the hawkish tone, treasury secretary Scott Bessent suggested a more conciliatory approach, proposing a potential extension of the tariff truce if Beijing delays its rare-earth restrictions.Trump still plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.Investors were also encouraged by data from the Fed’s “Beige Book” survey, which pointed to a softer US job market, echoing other recent weak economic indicators.Fed chair Jerome Powell had warned earlier this week that “the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,” reinforcing market bets on additional rate cuts.Economists, however, remain cautious.

Rare earth export restrictions spark ire



Trump-Xi meeting still on the cards







The United States has escalated its rhetoric against China on Wednesday, with treasury secretary Scott Bessent claiming that American Senators may back a staggering 500% tariff on Chinese imports over trade with Russia. Speaking at a press conference, Bessent said 85 US senators were ready to give US President Donald Trump the authority to impose the unprecedented duties.Bessent criticised Beijing for purchasing Russian energy, claiming such imports were fuelling what he described as the “Russian war machines.”“It is the purchase of Russian oil by China that fuels the Russian war machines. China buys 60%, six zero per cent, of Russian energy. They buy 90% of Iranian energy,” he said.The treasury secretary’s comments come amid repeated US warnings to China and India over continuing purchases of Russian oil.Beyond energy concerns, Bessent condemned China’s new export controls on rare earths, accusing the country of being “an unreliable partner to the world.” He criticised restrictions that block foreign militaries from using rare earth materials and warned that Washington would not be dictated by Beijing’s policies.“Make no mistake, this is China vs the world. They’ve put these unacceptable export controls on the entire world,” Bessent said.Despite the stern warnings, Bessent reaffirmed that talks between US and Chinese leaders were still planned. Trump is expected to meet Chinese officials in South Korea later this month.“As the president said, ‘We want to help China, not hurt it’… ultimately, we are confident in the strong relationship between President Trump and President Xi,” Bessent added.","The United States has escalated its rhetoric against China on Wednesday. treasury secretary Scott Bessent claimed that American Senators may back a staggering 500% tariff on Chinese imports over trade with Russia.

The United Kingdom on Wednesday announced 90 new sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector and Indian petroleum firm Nayara Energy Limited, in a fresh bid to cut off Moscow's wartime revenue streams.The UK's foreign, commonwealth and development office (FCDO) said the coordinated action, taken jointly with the Treasury, was designed to “strike at the heart” of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war funding machine.“Today’s action demonstrates the government’s determination to cut off Putin’s revenue streams – targeting Russian companies and their global enablers,” the FCDO said in a statement.The sanctions package targets four oil terminals in China, 44 tankers in what the UK described as a “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian crude, and Nayara Energy Limited, which the FCDO claimed had imported 100 million barrels of Russian oil worth over USD 5 billion in 2024 alone.London said the move is intended to “take Russian oil off the market” and choke off the flow of energy revenues feeding Putin’s “war chest” amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine.Nayara Energy earlier had been hit by European Union (EU) sanctions.“Nayara Energy operates in full compliance with the laws and regulations of India. As an Indian company, we are deeply committed to supporting the nation’s energy security and fostering economic growth,” Nayara Energy had said.“Recently, Nayara Energy has come under international scrutiny, facing political pressures and the imposition of sanctions by the European Union which have no legal basis. We categorically state that this unilateral move by the European Union is founded on baseless assertions, representing an undue extension of authority that ignores both international law and the sovereignty of India,” it added.The UK said the new measures also directly target Russia’s energy behemoths Rosneft and Lukoil — two of the world’s largest oil exporters, together shipping about 3.1 million barrels a day.Rosneft alone, the FCDO noted, accounts for nearly half of Russia’s oil production and roughly six per cent of global supply.",UK announces 90 new sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector and Indian petroleum firm Nayara Energy Limited.

China has filed a complaint against India at WTO over New Delhi’s subsidies for electric vehicles and batteries.

China’s complaint about India’s reported EV subsidies comes as Beijing seeks to boost exports of its EVs to India. This follows the two countries’ initiative to normalise relations after a five-year freeze in ties due to the Eastern Ladakh military standoff.Considering the size and scope of India’s auto market, Chinese EV automakers see it as a major source to expand sales.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

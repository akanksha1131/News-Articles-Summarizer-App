Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have been volatile amidst ongoing uncertainties on the global trade front with US President Donald Trump announcing tariff rates for almost 70 trading partners. Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:Last week, gold prices started the week on a lower note and fell to a near two-week low as the US struck a framework trade deal with the EU, reducing safe-haven demand. The agreement, echoing a similar one with Japan, imposed a 15% tariff on most EU goods—half the threatened rate—easing fears of a broader trade war.Meanwhile, the US and China held talks in Stockholm, aiming to extend a 90-day tariff truce, though any decision on extension rests with President Trump. The dollar index surged from 97 to 99, pushing USDINR above 87, capping some losses for the bullion domestic front. The Fed held rates steady at 4.25%-4.50%, with Chair Powell suggesting no immediate cuts, pending further data.US economic data showed mixed signals: better-than-expected GDP, ADP payrolls, inflation—PCE rose 0.3% in June, consumer confidence also rose slightly towards 100 mark.However, US non-farm payrolls data at the end of the week was reported quite lower than expectations triggering sharp recovery from lower levels in Gold and Silver prices.Amid ongoing tariff uncertainty, including Trump's fresh levies on Brazil, South Korea, and India and mixed economic update gold is hovering in a broad range, while silver remained weak, reflecting industrial metals' broader decline. A move in USDINR will be important to keep an eye on as any further upside could support further rally on the domestic front.The economic calendar is fairly light this week, however US factory orders, PMI data from major economies, trade balance from China and RBI and BOE policy meeting will be in focus. The deadline of August 1 is over however, there is still no clarity on major trading partners. Technically, Gold on COMEX was not able to breach the important $3280 mark on the lower side, hence some upside could be seen from these levels.","Gold prices have been volatile amidst ongoing uncertainties on the global trade front with US President Donald Trump announcing tariff rates for almost 70 trading partners.

Donald Trump Threatens To 'Substantially Increase' Tariffs On India Over Russian Oil

China and India Dominate Russian Oil Imports

So where does that leave Trump? We take a look at what’s happening:

Trump admin pressure on India, China

India has pushed back so far

China’s hard stance

Where is this headed?

US President Donald Trump’s threats and warnings to get Vladimir Putin to stop the Russia-Ukraine war don’t seem to be working as of now. His tactic of pressuring China and India - the two biggest buyers of Russia’s crude oil - are also not working.Both India and China, faced with the prospect of 100% tariffs, penalties and so on - have so far not stopped buying crude from Russia.China has demonstrated assertiveness in its dealings with the Trump administration, particularly when negotiations involve both trade and its energy and foreign policy matters. India too has not asked its refineries to explore other markets and reduce dependency on Russia.Trump on Monday said he would raise the tariff rate for India since it continues to purchase crude oil from Russia.“India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!,” Trump posted on Truth Social.While imposing a 25% tariff rate on India last week, Trump had warned of an ‘additional penalty’ for India’s trade with Russia on oil and arms.Trump administration officials have also accused India of ‘financing’ Russia’s war against Ukraine through its oil purchases.Simultaneously, the Trump administration is also asking China to stop all oil imports from Russia, threatening 100% tariffs.Following discussions between China and the US last week, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent spoke to journalists, noting that regarding Russian oil acquisitions, the ""Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.""""We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,"" Bessent said.Also Read | Big message! PM Modi strikes defiant ‘Make in India’ note in face of Trump’s tariff & penalty threats; India to continue buying Russia oil On Thursday, whilst acknowledging the Chinese as formidable negotiators, Bessent remained optimistic about the talks' progress, telling CNBC, ""I believe that we have the makings of a deal.""Hitting out at US warning of higher tariffs, India said that it will protect its interests . “…it is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia….Where the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its EV industry, fertilizers as well as chemicals,” the MEA statement reads.“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” it added.Following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has substantially increased its Russian oil imports. The proportion has risen dramatically from a previous 0.2% to now constituting between 35-40% of India's total crude purchases.Despite recent threats of penalties and 100% tariffs from the US, India has so far not halted on its oil trade with Russia. Last week a few reports suggested that Indian refiners have stopped buying oil from Russia, but officials have been quick to say that the government has not given any directions to oil refineries to stop buying Russian crude oil.Also Read | Russia oil in focus: Tankers deliver millions of barrels of Russian crude to India; no impact of Trump, EU pressure yet Sources who spoke to ANI explicitly dismissed rumours about India stopping Russian oil imports and addressed Trump's subsequent comments supporting these claims.Several oil tankers discharged millions of barrels of Russian crude at Indian refineries over the weekend.On Friday, foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal characterised India-Russia relations as a ""steady and time-tested partnership.""Officials from the United States and China might resolve numerous disagreements to secure a trade agreement and prevent punitive tariffs, yet they remain distinctly divided regarding America's insistence that China cease its oil purchases from Iran and Russia.China's foreign ministry issued a statement on X on Wednesday after two days of trade talks in Stockholm last week, responding to America's threat of a 100% tariff: ""China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests.""""Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,"" the ministry said.This response stands out particularly as both Beijing and Washington express positive sentiments and willingness to achieve a trade agreement.Also Read | Donald Trump's 25% tariff: India expects minimal impact; indicates agriculture, dairy, GM food no-go areas in trade deal talks Gabriel Wildau, a director at Teneo consultancy, expressed skepticism about President Donald Trump implementing the full 100% tariff. He told AP that such actions would undermine recent developments and eliminate possibilities for Trump and President Xi Jinping to establish a trade agreement during their potential autumn meeting.Tu Xinquan, who heads the China Institute for WTO Studies at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics, reportedly said, ""If the US is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance."" WTO represents the World Trade Organization.With India and China both refusing to budge on their Russia oil buys so far, it certainly seems that Trump will have to look at other ways to stop the Russia-Ukraine war.Also Read | Donald Trump’s 25% tariff, ‘dead economy’ jibe: India sends clear message to the US in 5 points - what Piyush Goyal said","Despite recent threats of penalties and 100% tariffs from the US, India has so far not halted on its oil trade with Russia.

"US effective tariff rate on Indian goods rises to 20.7%, up from 2.4% in 2024; escalating trade tensions cast shadow on growth outlook: Fitch report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-effective-tariff-rate-on-indian-goods-rise-to-20-7-up-from-2-4-in-2024-escalating-trade-tensions-cast-shadow-on-growth-outlook-fitch-report/articleshow/123108150.cms,"AI-generated image

The effective US tariff rate on Indian goods jumped to 20.7 per cent in 2025 from just 2.4 per cent in 2024, Fitch Ratings said in its latest assessment.Fitch reported, quoted by ET, noted that the overall US effective tariff rate stands at 17 per cent- about 8 percentage points lower than the estimate made on April 3 when reciprocal tariffs were initially declared. It explained, “The US tariff rate of 17 per cent reflects a 15 per cent tariff rate on EU goods, including auto and auto parts, and higher tariffs for major trading partners Brazil, Taiwan, India and Switzerland.”Also read: How India, China may not come to Trump’s rescue to get Putin to stop Russia-Ukraine war The revised numbers come days after US President Donald Trump formally announced a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, alongside a separate, undefined ""penalty"" linked to India’s ongoing energy trade with Russia.As the trade environment becomes increasingly uncertain, economists are trimming their growth expectations for India. Goldman Sachs has cut its growth projection for 2025 to 6.5 per cent and for 2026 to 6.4 per cent, citing the tariff surge as a key driver of the revision. “In our view, some of these tariffs are likely to be negotiated lower over time, and further downside risk to the growth trajectory mainly emanates from the uncertainty,” the investment bank said. HDFC Bank , in its own analysis, estimated that the new US tariffs could reduce India’s GDP growth by 20 to 25 basis points.Christian de Guzman, senior vice president at Moody’s Ratings, said the long-term effects could weigh on India’s ambitions to become a major manufacturing hub. “Curtailed access to the largest economy globally diminishes prospects for India’s ambitions to develop its manufacturing sector, particularly in higher value-added sectors such as electronics,” he said, as quoted by ET.Despite the rising headwinds, Moody’s maintains a relatively positive outlook on India’s broader economic stability. “India’s economy is expected to remain resilient as it is less trade-reliant than other large economies in the Asia-Pacific,” de Guzman added.",The effective US tariff rate on Indian goods jumped to 20.7% in 2025 from just 2.4% in 2024.

Trump's threat spells uncertainty for exporters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-threat-spells-uncertainty-for-exporters/articleshow/123107083.cms,"AP photo

New Delhi: American President Donald Trump's latest announcement of a possible ""substantial increase"" in tariffs on Indian goods, added to the uncertainty for exporters, amid indications that govt was looking at select segments of affected industries instead of a broad-based support.To go ahead with the orders for the upcoming busy season around Christmas, tariff uncertainty is seen as the biggest issue as the buyers would compare the tariffs across countries before finalising them. In several sectors where India is competitive, including textiles and footwear, rival countries such as Bangladesh enjoy a five percentage point tariff advantage.But with the unspecified ""penalty"" on India for its Russian oil purchases, buyers would be unable to do the arithmetic. Besides, they would be worried about the possibility of the additional tariff coming into force over the next few months when the order is in the pipeline. As a result, they may be deterred from placing orders with Indian suppliers, many of whom they have dealt with over the years. Govt sources said that the exporters need to provide detailed analysis of the segments that will be hit by the 25% tariff. A broad-based comparison may not work as there may be other factors at play.For instance, when it comes to shrimps, Ecuador is seen to be a major beneficiary of Trump's tweaked tariff announcements. But it may not have the capacity to completely replace Indian exports, estimated at over $2 billion. That's because it's a product segment where production can't be stepped up by running more machines, pointed industry and govt sources. Besides, the exporters would need to meet American standards and get the required certification, which takes time.Similarly, when it comes to textiles, not all segments will be hit equally hard. Besides, Indian players have a strong footing in some of them. For instance, when it comes to cotton T-shirts, India has a 36% share of the women's and girl's dress segment in the US.","President Donald Trump's latest announcement of a possible ""substantial increase"" in tariffs on Indian goods, added to the uncertainty for exporters.

Macquarie maintained an outperform rating on ITC with the target price at Rs 500. Analysts said ITC’s April-June quarter was an inline quarter with healthy volumes in the cigarette business but its paper business showed weakness. They said that a 6.5% volume growth in the cigarette business and mix improvement partly offset leaf tobacco inflation. The company sees signs of urban recovery in FMCG and saw correction in leaf tobacco costs in current crop cycle. Analysts said continued weakness in the paper business is concerning, the demand recovery across cigarettes/FMCG make them constructive on growth.CLSA has an underperform rating on Tata Power with the target price at Rs 351. Analysts said Tata Power’s April-June quarter was impacted by weak Indonesian coal mines, renewable energy (RE) independent power producer (IPP) businesses and losses in Tata Projects. They said the company’s first quarter core profitability was impacted by its RE IPP business, which is a key long-term catalyst. High treasury income drove the company’s reported net profit. Analysts said the only bright spot was the solar EPC and module business, which did well due to India’s solar module import ban.Antique maintained its buy rating on UPL with the target price raised to Rs 730 from Rs 710. Analysts said the company gave a subdued performance in Q1 but FY26 guidance was intact. The company plans to hike prices of key products to aid margin recovery while balance sheet deleveraging remains a medium-term priority.Jefferies has a buy rating on Adani Enterprises with the target price at Rs 3,000. Analysts said Q1 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was weak and declined about 12-13% on the year while net profit fell 50% on the year due to higher depreciation charges. EBITDA miss was from older established business in coal trading and commercial mining, while Airport/New Energy EBITDA was ahead. The company’s net debt was higher as it is nearing completion of new projects in airport, copper and road businesses.Goldman Sachs maintained its sell rating on Thermax with the target price hiked to Rs 3,210 from Rs 3,060. Analysts said the company’s Q1 was a weak quarter but they factored in an improved business outlook. Order inflow for the quarter grew at 7% on an annualised basis due to weak industrial products and chemical businesses. The management remained quite optimistic on orders coming through in FY26. Analysts said they see improved profitability as execution of lower margin orders gradually comes to an end.","Macquarie maintained an outperform rating on ITC with the target price at Rs 500.

Mumbai: IRDAI has imposed a record penalty of Rs 5 crore on Policybazaar for several violations found during a remote inspection conducted in June 2020. The breaches include conflict of interest, biased product promotion, irregular outsourcing payments, failure to map telemarketing sales to authorised verifiers, and delays in premium remittance.The company was fined Rs 1 crore for allowing its principal officer and other key managerial personnel to hold directorships in other firms without prior approval, which the regulator said posed a conflict of interest.Another Rs 1-crore penalty was imposed for promoting select insurance products as ""best"" or ""top"" on its website without using independent third-party data. Irdai said this practice was misleading, created preferential visibility for certain insurers, and restricted consumer choice.The regulator also cautioned the company on excess commissions, inadequate call recording systems, and poor due diligence on staff with insurance agency licences. Policybazaar has 45 days to remit the fine and may appeal to the Securities Appellate Tribunal.","IRDAI has imposed a record penalty of Rs 5 crore on Policybazaar for several violations found during a remote inspection conducted in June 2020.

'Warships On Move': China Joins Russia In Chilling Response To Trump’s Nuke Subs Deployment

In a critical juncture for US-China trade relations, officials from both nations are working to resolve their differences and potentially reach a trade agreement that could prevent the imposition of severe tariffs.However, a significant sticking point reportedly remains- the US demand for China to cease purchasing oil from Iran and Russia. China's Foreign Ministry took to X on Wednesday, following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, to assert its stance. ""China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,"" the ministry stated, responding to the US threat of a 100 per cent tariff. The ministry further emphasized, ""Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests."" This response comes at a time when both Beijing and Washington are expressing optimism about reaching a deal to stabilize commercial ties between the world's two largest economies.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking to reporters after the talks, acknowledged China's firm stance on its sovereignty. ""The Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously,"" Bessent said, as quoted by the Associated Press.He added, ""We do not want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100 per cent tariff."" Despite the challenges, Bessent remains hopeful about the negotiations. ""I believe that we have the makings of a deal,"" he told CNBC, describing the Chinese as ""tough"" negotiators.Gabriel Wildau, managing director of consultancy Teneo, expressed skepticism about the US following through with the 100 per cent tariff threat. ""Realising those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance"" for a trade deal announcement between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Wildau noted.The US aims to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran to reduce funding for their militaries, as Moscow continues its war against Ukraine and Tehran supports militant groups in the Middle East. China's firm stance is not new. When Trump announced a broad tariff plan in April, China was the only country to retaliate. ""If the US is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end,"" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies in Beijing, quoted by AP.Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, suggested that Beijing might use the situation as leverage to gain more concessions from Trump. Meanwhile, Danny Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute remarked that Beijing sees itself as ""the one holding the cards"" in its dealings with Washington.China's continued oil purchases from Russia and Iran are crucial for its strategic energy supply. A 2024 report by the US Energy Information Administration indicates that a significant portion of Iran's oil exports go to China, which imports over one million barrels of Iranian oil daily. Additionally, China is a major customer for Russian oil, second only to India. The ongoing negotiations and China's firm stance underscore the complexities of US-China trade relations, with energy policies playing a pivotal role in the discussions.","China's Foreign Ministry took to X on Wednesday, following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, to assert its stance.

Donald Trump tariffs: US advisor rules out talks; says rates are ‘pretty much set’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariffs-us-advisor-rules-out-talks-says-rates-are-pretty-much-set/articleshow/123080067.cms,"AI image

US President Donald Trump's trade advisor Jamieson Greer has said the new American tariff rates are “pretty much set” with limited scope for negotiation, defending the Trump administration’s latest round of levies, including harsh duties on Brazil.In a pre-recorded interview aired on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, US trade representative Greer said the rates were mostly determined by previously announced or confidential deals. “A lot of these are set rates pursuant to deals... others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country,” he explained.As per news agency AFP, Greer further noted that while some countries might still seek dialogue, the administration had reached a point where “we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.”The newly announced tariffs, unveiled last Thursday, will take effect on August 7 instead of the earlier proposed August 1 deadline. The move allows more time for US Customs and Border Protection to update its systems, reported AFP, citing a senior official.One of the most significant tariff hikes targets Brazil, which now faces a 50 per cent duty on exports to the US. However, exemptions have been made for some key products like aircraft and orange juice.US President Donald Trump has openly admitted the measure is linked to Brazil’s prosecution of his political ally Jair Bolsonaro. The former Brazilian president is facing charges related to an alleged coup plot. Trump called the prosecution a “witch hunt.”Greer defended the geopolitical use of tariffs, saying: “The president has seen in Brazil, like he’s seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy.” He added, “It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues.”White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett echoed Greer’s views, telling NBC’s Meet the Press with Kristen Welker that while minor discussions may continue, most tariff rates are “more or less locked in.” He also ruled out any major revisions even if markets react negatively. “These are the final deals,” Hassett stated.As per AFP, the latest tariff move is part of Trump’s broader push to rebalance global trade ties.His executive order signed last Thursday enforces increased tariffs on 95 countries and territories, ranging from 10 per cent to 41 per cent.India, for example, has been hit with a 25 per cent duty over what the White House termed “obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers” and ongoing energy ties with Russia. Switzerland faces a 39 per cent tariff, while Syria tops the list with 41 per cent.Legal challenges are also emerging. An appeals court panel expressed scepticism last week over the administration’s authority to impose such duties, indicating the case may go to the US Supreme Court.","US President Donald Trump's trade advisor Jamieson Greer has said the new American tariff rates are “pretty much set” with limited scope for negotiation.

Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other key members of the OPEC+ alliance, collectively known as the Voluntary Eight (V8), have agreed to increase oil production by 547,000 barrels per day (bpd) starting September 2025, a move seen as an attempt to regain market share amid resilient oil prices.As per news agency AFP, the decision was finalised after a meeting of the eight producers, Iraq, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Oman, along with the Saudis and Russians, who currently produce around 41-42 million bpd.The new hike represents an increase of about 1.5% in total output.The group had already begun rolling back output cuts in April, part of a wider plan to unwind the 2.2 million bpd production reduction announced last year. As per the post-meeting statement, ""The eight participating countries will implement a production adjustment of 547,000 barrels per day in September 2025 from the August 2025 required production level.""OPEC added that the increase is being undertaken “in view of a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories.”The group also left the door open to revisiting the decision, stating that “the phase-out of the additional voluntary production adjustments may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions.”Analysts believe the hike is unlikely to cause significant price fluctuations. Brent crude is currently trading at around $70 per barrel. ""OPEC+ has passed the first test, unwinding 2.2 million barrels per day without crashing prices or compromising unity,"" Jorge Leon of Rystad Energy was quoted as saying by AFP.However, he warned that “the next task will be even harder: deciding if and when to unwind the remaining 1.66 million barrels, all while navigating geopolitical tension and preserving cohesion.”The latest move also includes a specific allotment of 300,000 bpd for the UAE, accelerating the timeline for production recovery by nearly a year from the initially planned 18-month schedule.Despite the shift towards higher output, OPEC+ continues to stress its commitment to stability. “The alliance is striving to find a balance between regaining market share and avoiding a sharp drop in oil prices,” said Tamas Varga of PVM Oil Associates, as per AFP.Experts are also wary of emerging uncertainties. According to AFP, analysts are closely watching potential risks from US President Donald Trump's trade and geopolitical policies, including tariffs and the evolving situation in Ukraine.The V8 will next meet on September 7 to assess market conditions, while the full 22-member OPEC+ alliance will hold its ministerial meeting at the end of November to decide on the path forward.","Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other key members of the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to increase oil production by 547,000 barrels per day starting September 2025.

Steep tariffs for those resisting Trump's demands

Legal battle escalates as costs rise for US consumers

Winners still end up paying more

US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariff regime, set to take effect August 7, has triggered a wave of economic disruption across the globe, from low-income nations like Laos and Algeria to wealthy trade partners such as Canada and Switzerland.Under the new policy, countries face steep new import duties unless they agree to revised trade terms with the US. Trump has framed the plan as a campaign for ""fairness"" under the slogan of ""Liberation Day,"" invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency and bypass Congress. But legal and economic blowback is mounting, with US courts weighing challenges and allies questioning Washington's reliability, AP reported.""In many respects, everybody's a loser here,"" said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School. ""The U.S. consumer's a big loser,"" added Alan Wolff, a former WTO deputy director-general and trade official.Even countries that struck deals to reduce their tariff exposure are still facing steeper import duties than before. The UK agreed to raise tariffs on its exports to the US from 1.3% to 10%, despite the US running a trade surplus with it for nearly two decades.The EU and Japan accepted 15% tariffs, lower than the threatened rates but still significantly higher than last year's levels.Nations that refused to negotiate fared far worse. Laos and Algeria, despite low per capita incomes, now face tariffs of 40% and 30% respectively. Brazil was slapped with a 50% levy, reportedly over its treatment of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Canada drew a 35% tariff, tied in part to its position on Palestinian statehood.Even Switzerland, which did not reach an agreement, was hit with a 39% import tax, exceeding the originally announced 31%.""The Swiss probably wish that they had camped in Washington to make a deal,"" said Wolff, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Five US businesses and 12 states have filed lawsuits against the new tariffs, arguing that Trump overstepped his authority. In May, the US Court of International Trade sided with plaintiffs, blocking the tariffs, though collections continue during the appeal process.Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that US businesses and consumers are absorbing most of the cost. Companies including Walmart, Nike, Best Buy and Procter & Gamble have all raised prices in response.""This is a consumption tax, so it disproportionately affects those with lower incomes,"" said Appleton. ""Your appliances are going to go up. Your TV and electronics are going to go up. Your video game devices, consoles are going to go up.""According to Yale University's Budget Lab, the average US tariff has jumped from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3%, the highest since 1934. The lab estimates this will cost the average US household $2,400 annually.Even countries that reached deals to avoid Trump's harshest penalties are still absorbing high tariffs. Taiwan saw its rate lowered from 32% to 20%, and Angola's from 32% to 15% — but both were paying less than 2% before the new policy.Lesotho, one of the poorest nations affected, saw its tariff reduced from 50% to 15%, though economists say the damage may already be done.""He [Trump] wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,"" said Wolff, referring to Trump's transactional approach to global trade.","US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariff regime, set to take effect August 7, has triggered a wave of economic disruption across the globe.

Insane Tesla Coil Performance BLOWS Elon Musk Away: Electricity Flies Between Performers | WATCH

A federal jury in Miami has ruled that Tesla must pay over $200 million in damages after finding its Autopilot driver-assist technology was partly responsible for a fatal 2019 crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured Dillon Angulo in Florida.The jury awarded $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million out of a total $129 million in compensatory damages to be paid by Tesla, concluding that the company’s driver-assist system failed and bore significant responsibility for the crash. This decision makes Tesla liable for nearly two-thirds of the total damages, reported AP.The verdict also comes at a critical time for CEO Elon Musk, who is pushing to expand Tesla’s autonomous vehicle technology and roll out a driverless taxi service in multiple US cities.The incident occurred when George McGee, who was driving a Tesla vehicle, ran through flashing lights, a stop sign, and a T-intersection at 62 mph, crashing into the parked Chevrolet Tahoe.Responding to the ruling, Tesla issued a statement calling the verdict “wrong,” and argued that it undermines the industry's efforts to develop lifesaving technology.“Today’s verdict is wrong,"" and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement lifesaving technology”.They said the plaintiffs concocted a story ”blaming the car when the driver from day one admitted and accepted responsibility. ”The plaintiffs’ lead attorney Brett Schreiber, conceded that the driver, George McGee, acted negligently by running through flashing lights, a stop sign, and a T-intersection at a speed of 62 miles per hour before crashing into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe.“I trusted the technology too much,” McGee said during his testimony. “I believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.”However, Schreiber maintained that Tesla also bore responsibility. He argued that the company enabled dangerous driving behavior by failing to automatically disable Autopilot when drivers became distracted, and by permitting its use on roads like the one McGee was on—routes the system wasn’t intended to operate on.Tesla’s lead defense attorney in the Miami trial, Joel Smith, responded by emphasizing that the company clearly instructs drivers to stay attentive and keep their hands on the wheel. He said McGee ignored those warnings while searching for a dropped cellphone and was speeding, increasing the risk. Smith pointed out that McGee had driven through the same intersection 30 to 40 times without incident, concluding, “The cause is that he dropped his cellphone. ”Jury called out Tesla’s use of the term “Autopilot” as misleading.Brett Schreiber argued that while other automakers use terms like “driver assist” or “copilot,” Tesla’s branding gave consumers a false sense of full autonomy, leading to over-reliance on the system.Lawyers for the family of the deceased also claimed that Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident.Financial analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities comments on the verdict, “It's not a good day for Tesla. It's a big number that will send shock waves to others in the industry.”The ruling marks a rare outcome in product liability litigation against Tesla. A car crash lawyer Miguel Custodio, said, “This will open the floodgates.” “It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.” Several similar lawsuits have been filed against the company in recent years, but many have been dismissed or settled before reaching trial.","Jury awards Tesla $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million in compensatory damages.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

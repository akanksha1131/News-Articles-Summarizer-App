Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, Camlin Fine Sciences and Equinox India Developments are the top stock picks for today. Here’s their view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for February 7, 2025:The Nifty traded in a range with corrective bias in the last two sessions after 1000 points up move in previous seven sessions highlighting consolidation ahead of the RBI Monetary policy outcome.Going ahead, we expect index to trade with a positive bias while sustaining above the support area of 23,400-23,200 and gradually head towards 24,000-24,200 levels in the coming weeks which is the 38.2% retracement of the previous fall (26277-22786) and upper band of the falling channel containing entire decline of the last four months.Key support is placed at 23,200-23,400 levels being the confluence of the last week low, last Tuesday gap up area and past three weeks breakout area. Stock specific action will continue to remain in focus as we sail through the fag end of the Q3FY25 earnings seasons.Volatility is anticipated to remain elevated due to fluctuating global cues, the RBI monetary policy outcome, and the results of the upcoming Delhi elections.On the market breadth front, the percentage of stocks above the 50-day SMA within the Nifty 500 universe has increased from a bearish extreme of 9% last week to 23%. Additionally, the weekly stochastic oscillator has bounced back from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal, further supporting the positive bias.Bank Nifty in the last two sessions consolidated in a range after rallying 2500 points in the preceding 9 sessions. The index in the process closed above the last three weeks range indicating revival in the upward momentum.We believe 48,900-49,200 to act as immediate support and any dip witnessed hereon should be capitalized as a buying opportunity in quality stock in a staggered manner. We expect the index to head towards 51,200-51,500 levels in the coming sessions being the measuring implication of the last three weeks range breakout and the 50% retracement of the previous decline (53,888-47,844).Volatility is likely to remain elevated on account of RBI monetary policy outcome on Friday. Key support is seen at 48,900-49,200 being the confluence of current week low and 61.8% retracement of the recent up move.The stock is seen breaking above the last five weeks range (140-120) as it is seen rebounding after a base above the 200 days EMA thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily RSI is in uptrend thus supports the positive bias. The stock is expected to head higher towards 157 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the last five weeks range breakout (140-120).The share price of Equinox India Developments is at the cusp of breakout above the falling supply line joining the highs of CY21 and CY24 thus offers entry opportunityThe stock has formed a good base around the 50 day EMA and is forming higher highs and higher lows in the weekly chart. We expect the stock to head higher towards 169 levels in the coming months being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous breather (164-106)","The Nifty traded in a range with corrective bias in the last two sessions.

Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh.

For example, for a person having income of Rs 12,10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax, works out to be Rs. 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakhs + 10% of Rs 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10 thousand). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs.

MUMBAI: Temasek and KKR-backed Rebel Foods is foraying into the quick food delivery space, stepping up competition in a market where players like Zomato, Swiggy and Zepto are spending heavily to get ahead of the game. The Mumbai-based company is betting on the fact that consumers who are often driven by convenience will increasingly switch to 10-15 minute food delivery if they are catered well. For Rebel Foods, which already runs multiple cloud kitchen brands such as Behrouz Biryani, Faasos Wraps and has infrastructure in place, the launch of the 15-minute food delivery service branded as QuickiES comes without incurring significant costs.""When consumers get hunger pangs, they crave for food then and there itself. Why should 15-minute food delivery not happen? The underlying demand is there, the consumer need is there, it is just about plugging that need gap,"" Sagar Kochhar, co-founder and CEO, EatSure at Rebel Foods told TOI, claiming that the move did not come amid competition or investor pressure.""We certainly keep an eye on competition but it was completely backed by consumer insights,"" Kochhar said. He added that the demand for light snacking meals will be the initial driver of quick food ordering among consumers, but they will eventually shift to it for all meal occasions if the quality of food is good.Rebel Foods has all its brands listed on Swiggy and Zomato's food delivery apps besides its own in-house app EatSure. But for the 15-min service, all customer orders will be fulfilled only through EatSure. The firm already has access to customer data through its app EatSure which it can leverage to predict consumer demand and craft its menu right, benefits that traditional restaurant brands often do not have.Besides, the quick food deliveries will be serviced through its existing cloud kitchens which make food in batches every couple of hours, enabling fresh food deliveries to consumers.

Deutsche Bank is the sole arranger for the deal, they added. Other investors in talks include Farallon Capital Management, Ares Management Corp. and EAAA India Alternatives, said the people.Lenders are familiar with Shapoorji Pallonji, a Mumbai-based construction and real estate conglomerate after one of its units sold India's biggest high-yield rupee bond in 2023 and has faced challenges repaying its debts. The group is controlled by billionaire Shapoor Pallonji Mistry, whose family is the fourth-richest in Asia, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.The new deal would deepen India's private credit industry, which is expanding as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's infrastructure push drives demand for middle-market funding in everything from solar power to roads. Proceeds will primarily be used to refinance existing debt, the people said, adding that the process of documentation for finalising term sheets will start soon. The firm will use various real estate properties of the group, along with other assets, as collateral, the people said. Terms are not yet finalised and could change.An Ernst & Young report said private credit investments in India totalled $9.2 billion across 163 deals last year, while warning that increased competition in the performing credit space was making it harder to close deals and leading to lending standards being compromised.Shapoorji Pallonji, Cerberus, Davidson Kempner, Farallon and Varde didn't immediately reply to requests for comment. Ares, Deutsche Bank and EAAA India Alternatives declined to comment.","Shapoorji Pallonji Group is in advanced talks with top global private credit funds.

Adani Group finds revised tariff unviable



NEW DELHI: Adani Green Energy has pulled out of two proposed wind power projects and linked transmission lines, which would have seen a total investment of about $1 billion, in Sri Lanka after Colombo sought to trim the tariff.The company wrote to Sri Lanka's Board of Investment on Wednesday to convey its decision. ""Adani Green Energy has conveyed its board's decision to withdraw from further engagement regarding these projects. However, we remain committed to Sri Lanka and are open to future collaboration if the govt (there) so desires,"" a company spokesperson said on Thursday.The agreement for the project was signed in May 2024 when an interim govt headed by President Ranil Wikremesinghe was in office. The project entailed building two wind farms with a total capacity of 484 MW in Mannar and Pooneryn regions along with transmission lines to evacuate power. These were to be completed by 2026.It came under scrutiny after Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the presidential election in Sept 2024 on anti-corruption plank and a promise to cancel the deal.In Jan, his govt revoked the power purchase agreement along with orders to review the project and renegotiate the tariff from $0.08 per unit to $0.06 or lower.Adani Group found the revised tariff economically unviable, but told the Board of Investments it respected the Sri Lankan govt's sovereign right to review the project.",The company wrote to Sri Lanka's Board of Investment on Wednesday to convey its decision.

NCLT approves JSW Energy's 16k cr bid for KSK Mahanadi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nclt-approves-jsw-energys-16k-cr-bid-for-ksk-mahanadi/articleshow/118230900.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) has given a green light to JSW Energy 's resolution plan for KSK Mahanadi Power Company under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, which will result in an upfront cash recovery of around Rs 16,000 crore for financial creditors, which is around half their claim. Besides, the creditors will get a 26% stake in the company.While the resolution process had started in 2019 the plan was finalised in Nov 2024 and submitted around a month ago. The NCLT bench, comprising members Rajiv Bharadwaj and Sanjay Puri, decided on the issue within a month, sending a strong signal that the tribunal is not sitting on proposals, especially where the amount involved is large. In fact, NCLT, IBBI and govt have been seeking to expedite cases.While there were 10 resolution applicants vying for KSK Mahanadi, there were six - including Adani Power, Capri Global, Jindal Power, NTPC Vedanta and JSW - which participated in the challenge as the resolution professional sought to maximise the realisation for creditors. Aditya Birla Asset Reconstruction Company, Prudent ARC, Power Finance Corp and REC are the largest creditors to KSK Mahanadi. Power Finance Corporation had initiated the insolvency process against the company.The admitted claims of creditors were to the tune of Rs 26,000 crore. JSW Energy has proposed to arrange Rs 13,000 crores debt and the remaining Rs.3,084 in the form of quasi-equity.The cash realisation is significantly higher than the fair value of Rs 9,947 crore and Rs 6,849 crore liquidation value.","The National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) has given a green light to JSW Energy's resolution plan for KSK Mahanadi Power Company.

Focus on simplification & lower compliance burden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/focus-on-simplification-lower-compliance-burden/articleshow/118230863.cms,"Representative image

Tax certainty and ease of paying taxes have been given consistent priority by govt in the last few years. In keeping with these principles, the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 sets out to achieve the fundamental objectives of simplification in language, reducing litigation, weeding out redundant provisions and lowering compliance burden . A preliminary study of the bill shows that it proposes many positive features to meet these goals.The bill offers a shorter legislation with section count reduced from over 800 to 536, and word count cut by 40-50%. New schedules are organised in a reader-friendly way and the proposed law will have sixteen schedules instead of the current fourteen. To maintain stability, the new bill continues with the current structure of twenty-three chapters and heads of income. The substantive provisions and the assessment and appeal procedures are also the same. Tax rates will be determined by the Finance Act each year.The bill has positive simplification aspects. It introduces the concept of 'tax year' of twelve months in place of complicated terms like 'previous year' and 'assessment year' to provide greater clarity about the period for tax payments, income tax return filing, and other tax compliances. Generally, the tax year will begin from April 1 and end on March 31 of the following year.The language has been simplified by removing the numerous 'provisos', 'explanations', and old legal jargons. For instance, the bill replaces the phrase 'notwithstanding anything contained' by 'irrespective of anything contained' to make it easier for taxpayers to read the law. Where required, formulas and tables have been introduced to crisply present the provisions. Especially for subjects like salary perquisites, presumptive taxation, and withholding tax rates and thresholds, this approach would be helpful in clearly understanding the requirements. The detailed/multiple sub-sections under main sections in the current law have been shifted to distinct schedules. For example, existing Section 10 that lists out all types of exempt incomes has been moved to seven different schedules in the bill. Removal of outdated sections, like provisions for investment allowances on new plant and machinery, has also helped clean out the legislation.The bill allows a taxpayer to apply for lower withholding tax certificate under all TDS/TCS provisions instead of only a select few under the current law. This will reduce compliance for taxpayers at large. In another positive, the bill proposes an option to non-resident shipping and airline companies to offer lower income than presumptive computation by maintaining tax audited books.The bill would be examined by a Parliamentary Committee. We hope, the opportunity would be used for consultation and debate on some aspects. The bill seems to withdraw the current deduction for inter-corporate dividends for companies that opt for concessional tax rate of 22%. This may bring back the cascading impact of tax on dividends, that the current law addresses. Surely, basis consultations some of these aspects will be reviewed now, and over time some other issues persisting in the existing Act would be dealt with.It is well-acknowledged that economies with simple and well-designed tax systems can incentivise compliance and boost businesses activity, ultimately resulting in higher economic growth, investments and employment. Income Tax Bill, 2025 reflects govt's sincere commitment towards creating a more transparent and conducive tax environment that will help save time and costs for both the tax administration and the taxpayers. It is an imperative step in govt's continuing focus on reforms, and the momentum must continue.(Gupta is India tax leader and Mathur is tax director, EY.

NEW DELHI: A select committee of the Parliament will vet the Income Tax bill, after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced it in Lok Sabha on Thursday, and urged the Speaker that it be referred for the parliamentary panel's scrutiny. The select committee will submit its report on the first day of the monsoon session.The bill was introduced after objections from MPs N K Premachandran, Manish Tewari and Saugata Roy were overruled. The three members had questioned the bill's introduction on various grounds.Sitharaman said Premachandran's objection that the proposed bill was increasing the total sections was incorrect. She said when the bill was enacted in 1961, it had 298 sections which, with time, went up to 819 sections, while the new bill was bringing them down to 536 sections. She said that the bill is half the size of the current law in terms of the word count - 2.6 lakh instead of 5.1 lakh.She said Premachandran should compare the proposed bill with where it stands at present, instead of where it was in 1961. She also dismissed Premachandran's claim that ""objects and reasons"" of the new bill were different from those of the original bill.The tax department said that it followed a detailed exercise with a team of 150 officers to draft the new bill over the last six months. The focus has been on making the law shorter and simpler by doing away with obsolete provisions, 900 provisos and close to 1,200 explanations and introducing tables and formulae.The tax department said the bill lays down the administrative framework, assigns roles and responsibilities for assessing officers, taxpayers, tax deductors and professionals. In addition, it sets out the framework for income determination, timelines, appellate procedures, enforcement, assessments, and penalties.""With the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 being tabled in Parliament, the process to repeal over-six-decades-old tax code is underway, which over the years had become complex, as tax laws were amended to keep pace with emerging business realities... Perhaps the expectations that the proposed bill would also herald a new era of dispute resolution mechanism may not have been addressed, however the door is not closed considering govt's repeated acknowledgement of the need to address burgeoning tax disputes,"" said Naveen Aggarwal, partner-tax at KPMG in India.","A select committee of the Parliament will vet the Income Tax bill.

NEW DELHI: Faced with sluggish sales during the festive period, consumer-centric companies , high street fashion, luxury and jewellery brands are witnessing a surge in sales as they approach Valentine's Day (V-Day). Consumers are splurging on a variety of items, with an uptick in demand for jewellery, apparel, premium chocolates, and curated experiences like short weekend getaways.For some retailers, sales are on par with the festive buying season, significantly boosting the commercial appeal of the occasion. Not to be left behind, quick commerce platforms including Zomato are capitalising on the spike in demand for flowers, cakes and desserts, while restaurants are preparing to handle the expected surge in footfalls.Last year, on V-Day, sales of popular categories like cake and desserts on Zomato increased three-to-four times compared to a regular day and gift hampers saw a twelve-fold increase.

The popular range is between Rs 15,000 to a lakh.

""It's too early to report a surge in sales, as it has been less than a month since we've started. Silver's overall contribution to our business remains relatively low.

Clarity on crypto, agri income in new I-T Bill

NEW DELHI: FM Nirmala Sitharaman is set to move a 622-page Income Tax Bill , with 536 clauses, on Thursday to repeal the current 64-year-old law that runs into 823 pages and has 819 sections. The draft legislation, with simpler language, seeks to do away with ""assessment year"" and sets a definition of "" tax year "" that'll be aligned with financial year.There are no deep structural changes to overhaul existing provisions or a change in deadline for filing. Several experts said the focus is on making the law easier to grasp which will reduce litigation.At several places, the Bill has tables related to TDS provisions, presumptive tax rates and time limit for assessment, aimed at giving clarity. Besides, some formulas have been included. ""Notwithstanding"" has been replaced with ""irrespective of anything"" at several places, tax experts said. Archaic and convoluted language has been largely dropped.While the bill is likely to be referred to a parliamentary panel, the new law is proposed to be implemented from next April, although Sitharaman had said the process of consultation will be followed.""The language is simpler. One excellent change is replacement of the concept of assessment year and previous year with tax year. While innumerable provisos and explanations in the existing Act have been eliminated, various conditions attached to each exemption or deduction continue, but are couched in simpler language,"" said Gautam Nayak of CNK Associates, a Mumbai-based CA firm.The Income Tax Bill will seek to bring all provisions related to areas such as salaries and perquisites together, making it easier for taxpayers to understand.""In the earlier law, there were multiple cross references between sections and rules, which often led to complications for taxpayers. In the new bill, the number of proviso and explanations have been substantially reduced and the references to rules and other sections have been curtailed. This will ensure a taxpayer will be able to gain a sensible understanding of the section by reading the section itself and they do not need to refer to other rules and sections. Further, the old law was amended several times over 60 years and hence, there were ample references to redundant sections, previous dates and years, which have been removed now,"" said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner at consulting firm AKM Global.The bill proposes a taxpayer charter , something that has been rolled out but has failed to provide any firm commitments by the department. It will define crypto assets for the first time, while doing away with definitions such as ""fringe benefit"".Nayak pointed out there is a change in the definition of agricultural income with income derived from saplings or seedlings grown in a nursery also included now, accepting the judicial pronouncements in this regard. ""In quite a few places, the bill clarifies the position better than the existing law - for instance, in stating when a person would be not ordinarily resident in India,"" he added.Maheshwari said the new section mandating that the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) must provide detailed directions, explicitly stating the points of determination, its decision, and the reasons behind it marks a significant shift from the earlier provision, which lacked clarity on the manner of issuing DRP directions. ""DRP orders will now be well-reasoned and adequately explained, ensuring transparency and reducing reliance on past rulings. This will improve quality of dispute resolution.""""The bill's primary objective is to simplify the tax laws, ensuring these are more transparent, easier to interpret and taxpayer friendly. By replacing complex provisions with clearer provisions, it aims to reduce legal disputes and encourage voluntary tax compliance,"" said Rohinton Sidhwa, partner at Deloitte India.","FM Nirmala Sitharaman is set to move a 622-page Income Tax Bill on Thursday.

"US inflation rises by most since August '23, dims rate cut chances",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-rises-by-most-since-august-23-dims-rate-cut-chances/articleshow/118195649.cms,"Representative image

US inflation picked up broadly at the start of the year, further undercutting chances of multiple Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year at the same time the Trump administration presses forward with tariffs. The monthly consumer price index rose in January by the most since August 2023, led by a range of household expenses like groceries and gas, as well as housing costs. Excluding often-volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core CPI climbed 0.4%, more than forecast, fueled by car insurance, airfares and a record monthly increase in the cost of prescription drugs.Inflation tends to come in higher in January, because many companies choose the start of the year to hike prices and fees. That pattern has been been exacerbated in the post-pandemic era, and several forecasters suggested that the jump in price growth last month won't be repeated going forward.Still, Wednesday's report serves as further evidence that inflation progress has at least stalled - if not in danger of being reversed. Combined with a solid labour market, it will likely keep the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future.","Consumer price index rose in January by the most since August 2023.

Fed in no hurry for rate cuts: Jerome Powell hints no change in US central bank's policy stance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-in-no-hurry-for-rate-cuts-jerome-powell-hints-no-change-in-us-central-banks-policy-stance/articleshow/118153596.cms,"Future of interest rate cuts remains uncertain

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US central bank will be keeping its interest rates unchanged for now, citing inflation levels which fall above Fed’s 2 per cent target and a solid job market.Speaking before the Senate Banking Committee on the first of a two-day testimony, Powell hinted that the central bank would maintain its current policy stance, having already cut rates by a full percentage point in late 2024.“With the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,” he said.His comments come at a time when the Trump administration is introducing sweeping policy changes, including tariffs on steel and aluminium and significant reductions in government spending.The Fed is also conducting a second review of its policy strategies and communication tools, though Powell insisted this would not include changing the bank’s inflation target , despite calls from some economists to raise it.After the Fed’s last review in 2019, it shifted to an average inflation target of 2 per cent, which analysts argue resulted in its slow response to rising prices in 2021 and 2022. The central bank only began raising rates in March 2022 to curb inflation by making borrowing more expensive.At its December meeting, the Fed projected two rate cuts in 2025, thought the market analysts are now less confident. Morgan Stanley revised their forecast to just one rate cut next year, while futures markets suggested a single cut in July.Fewer reductions would mean continued high borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and auto loans, though mortgage rates are also influenced by movements in US Treasury yields.Fed Governor Adriana Kugler had earlier said that the labour market was “stable,” allowing policymakers more time to assess their next move.She also acknowledged that Trump’s proposed economic policies, including tariffs and immigration restrictions, could result in new inflationary pressures. Some economists warn of mass deportations that could shrink the labour force and drive wages higher, fuelling inflation.Others argue that Trump’s deregulation agenda might boost supply and lower prices.“The cautious and the prudent step is to hold the (Fed's key) rate where it is for some time,” Kugler said.Strong job growth suggested less urgency for the Fed to cut rates, a stark contrast to last September, when weak hiring prompted a steep half-point rate reduction amid recession fears.“The latest data bolsters our confidence that the Fed cutting cycle is over,” economists at Bank of America wrote in a note on Friday.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US central bank will be keeping its interest rates unchanged.

Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.

Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Bitcoin dropped from around $105,000 on Saturday to about $92,000 on Sunday night. However, it later recovered to over $100,000 on Monday after Trump paused tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods.While bitcoin showed some recovery, other cryptocurrencies saw larger losses. Ethereum , dogecoin, and other digital assets declined sharply. Trump’s own meme coin traded at around $19 on Monday, about 75 per cent below its peak when he launched it before his second inauguration.“These are riskier cryptos than bitcoin,” Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency analyst was quoted as saying by news agency Associated. “But it’s a little surprising how big the gap is.”Financial markets also saw major shifts before the tariffs were set to take effect. Trump warned that Americans might feel “some pain” from the tariffs but said the move was necessary. He also suggested that tariffs on the European Union and possibly the United Kingdom could follow.Bitcoin was created in 2009 as digital cash outside government control. Over the years, it has become more mainstream, with its price movements now closely tied to tech stocks.Meme coins, a more volatile part of the crypto market, have also seen sharp declines. First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin, launched before Trump took office, is down nearly 90% from its highest value.Trump, who was once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now embraced digital assets. He has promised to make the US a leader in crypto and has appointed officials supportive of the industry.Despite recent declines, cryptocurrencies have gained value since Trump’s election. Bitcoin remains close to its record high of $109,000.","Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.

But the conservative leader may also be seeking favor with Washington, where the Trump administration said Saturday it would impose its own 25% tariffs on Mexico.Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced Monday that the tariffs would be halted for now to give the two sides more time to negotiate. Trump has demanded that Mexico do more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling across the border.Noboa, who took time away from a re-election campaign to attend Trump's inauguration last month in Washington, has hailed Trump's win as a victory for Latin America.Ecuador's announcement comes amid the South American country's separate and bitter diplomatic dispute with Mexico, which last year severed diplomatic ties after Ecuadorian police broke into the Mexican Embassy to arrest Ecuador's former Vice President Jorge Glas.Ecuador's move was widely condemned as a breach of international law, while Ecuador said that Glas was wanted for fraud and not for political reasons and accused Mexico of illegitimately granting him political asylum at the diplomatic compound.Trade between the two countries is minimal, however, accounting for less than 1% of Mexico's total exports, according to Mexican central bank data.Noboa, heir to a banana fortune, is running Sunday in elections for his first complete constitutional term after being elected 18 months ago to finish the aborted mandate of ex-President Guillermo Lasso.","Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers.

Bitcoin suffers steep decline as tariff war tensions rise: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-suffers-steep-decline-as-tariff-war-tensions-rise-report/articleshow/117882286.cms,"Trump’s Tariffs sets off market jitters

Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ether witnessed steep declines on Monday as rising tariff war tensions weakened investor sentiments. During early trade in Asia, Bitcoin fell to $94,476.18, briefly hitting a three-week low of $91,441.89.Ether saw an even steeper drop of 24 per cent, hitting its lowest level since September, to $2,494.33.The downturn extended into Sunday, with bitcoin slipping 7 per cent to $93,768.66, according to Coin Metrics. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, dropped 19 per cent.The selloff follows US President Donald Trump’s announcements of a a 25 per cent levy on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, set to take effect on Tuesday. Given that the US conducts around $1.6 trillion in annual trade with these three nations, the move has heightened fears of an economic slowdown.In retaliation to the levies, Canada and Mexico vowed to impose countermeasures, while China signalled plans to challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation.""Crypto is really the only way to express risk over the weekend, and on news like this, crypto resorts to a risk proxy,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, told CNBC. The market volatility is expected to weaken economic growth, affect corporate earnings and drive inflation higher.Following Trump's victory in elections, Bitcoin had surged 40 per cent, reaching an all-time high of $107,071.86 on January 20, the day of his inauguration as the 47th US President. Much of this rally was driven by expectations that his administration would introduce crypto-friendly policies, with Trump himself vowing to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet.""However, despite early optimism, some investors have grown impatient over the lack of concrete regulatory reforms. Last month, Trump ordered the formation of a cryptocurrency working group to explore potential regulations and even consider a national crypto reserve, but rigid policy changes remain absent.Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the ongoing tariff war could ultimately benefit bitcoin in the long run. ""“A sustained tariff war will be amazing for bitcoin in the long run due to an eventual weakening of the dollar and US rates."" he told ET.Analysts are keeping a close eye on the $90,000 support level for bitcoin, warning that a drop below this threshold could trigger a slide towards $80,000. Historically, crypto markets have endured corrections of around 30 per cent during bull runs.","Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ether witnessed steep declines on Monday as rising tariff war tensions weakened investor sentiments.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

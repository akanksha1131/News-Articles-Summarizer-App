RBI monetary policy: MPC likely to cut repo rate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-set-to-end-longest-rate-pause/articleshow/117962535.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI's monetary policy committee began its meeting on Wed and is expected to end its longest pause with a rate cut on Friday, the first in nearly five years.The last rate cut was in May 2020 when RBI lowered the repo rate to 4% to support the economy during the Covid-induced lockdown. It later raised rates seven times to 6.5% due to inflation amid the Ukraine war, supply chain disruptions, and global price surges. The pause has remained since Feb 2023.Most economists expect a 25bps cut, but some believe it would be premature if US President Donald Trump escalates tariff threats, worsening financial market volatility. Lower interest rates could also pressure the rupee, making US debt more attractive for foreign investors.Dipanwita Mazumdar , an economist at Bank of Baroda , said risks to growth from uncertainty, highlighted in the IMF's latest report, could prompt RBI to start cutting rates. ""For other economies, rate cuts began earlier, giving them room for a 'wait and watch' approach,"" she said. ""Balancing macro and geopolitical factors, we believe there is space for a 25bps rate cut.""The policy meeting includes two new RBI members - governor Sanjay Malhotra and deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao - who will be attending the meeting for the first time in place of their predecessors Shaktikanta Das and Michael Patra, respectively. Malhotra recently announced liquidity measures injecting Rs 1.5 lakh crore, seen as paving the way for rate transmission. A liquidity deficit could keep borrowing costs high even if RBI cuts rates.

Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh.

'Budget's given comfort to monetary authority': Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-given-comfort-to-monetary-authority-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey/articleshow/117995724.cms,"In an interview to TOI,

Pandey, who is also in charge of the revenue department, said

Do you think the Budget has done enough to help accelerate growth against the backdrop of global uncertainties?

Is the time right for

monetary authorities to play a part in accelerating growth, for example with a rate cut?

So, has the Budget created conditions for a rate cut?

Is the tax relief largely to boost consumption and address some of the concerns of the middle class?

Have other levers of economy got required attention, apart from consumption and investment?

When do you expect I-T bill to be presented in Parliament? How will it make life of the taxpayer simple?

Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the 2025-26 Budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation .the Budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate. Excepts:It is a pro-growth Budget. We have headwinds and we also have internal challenges. We have addressed both. Although, we are still the fastest growing large economy in the world, not only we have to maintain this growth, but we have to push it up. We have addressed both the supply-side and demand-side and tried in a non inflationary way to maximise growth, accelerate growth.I think it's up to the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to take a call on that. But, on the fiscal side, we have done our bit. We have kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. FM had announced that it will be 4.9% in this year and we have been able to achieve 4.8%. FM had said fiscal consolidation path will mean we'll bring it to 4.5% next year. We are proposing 4.4% and there was also an announcement that thereafter we will have a glide path in terms of the debt-to-GDP level and a visibility would be given on how it will go forward. That has also been included in the FRBM statement.In a way, the Budget has provided whatever stimulations are required. We are not providing a stimulus at the cost of the deficit by increasing the deficit. So, we are giving sufficient sort of comfort to the monetary authority. However, they would have to take a call based on whatever.I would say consumption is one part. However, we are not really prescribing how taxpayers, who have got this money back in a way, how they will behave. Basically, the decision making is transferred to taxpayers, who have got this relief. They may choose to consume, save or invest directly in either of the three situations we have. It will have a salutary and good effect on the economy because if they choose to consume, it will boost demand. If they choose to invest indirectly, they are supporting the banks to extend more credit. Because, banks can give credit only when they have got increased deposits. And, if they choose to directly invest, for example in a house, they also participate in investments. In that case, it will work like an investment multiplier anyway. So, it will be a combination of consumption and investment multiplier, with a positive impact on savings. Overall, I would say it will be a growth-booster.A large economy like India has to have all engines firing. You cannot simply say we will only go for agriculture, not for manufacturing. Or, we will go for manufacturing and not for services. Therefore all three are required. If you see all the proposals on supply side, we have tried to see how we can speed up production, how we can speed up productivity and how we can spur employment. So, it is employment-led growth. In agriculture, we have taken steps to boost pulses productivity and increase credit limit for farmers. Everywhere we have said how we can boost production and productivity. We are saying let there be a growth path for MSMEs. Let there be more credit available for MSMEs. Let their participation in exports be more. Let there be more support for them in terms of innovation and research. Our tax policy is supporting labour intensive sectors.It is proposed to be done before Feb 13. We are not changing the policy through it. The same thing will be carried forward because after passing, this bill will be applicable from a future date. We wanted to reform right away. So, those reforms have been brought in this bill through amendments. There are so many redundant provisions. There are a number of changes. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted. In 63 years, the finance sector changed, plus there were many taxation laws and amendment bills. Things get complicated to read and they may also create interpretation problems. There could be many interpretation problems or litigations. If you have more readability, if you have clarity, there will be less litigation.","Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the 2025-26 Budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner.

RBI expected to cut repo rate by 0.25%; All eyes on governor Sanjay Malhotra’s first policy decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-expected-to-cut-repo-rate-by-0-25-all-eyes-on-governor-sanjay-malhotras-first-policy-decision/articleshow/117998055.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to announce cutting the repo rate by 25 basis points in its first policy decision under newly the appointed governor, Sanjay Malhotra , on Friday.Market experts believe this move aims to boost economic growth while maintaining inflation control .A report by Bank of Baroda suggested that inflationary pressures have eased, primarily due to the dip in prices of key vegetables like tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. As the supply situation has improved, Consumer Price Index (CPI) has aslo stablised, offering the central bank some flexibility for a measured rate cut.""Balancing and counterbalancing all macro and geopolitical factors, we believe there remains space for a 25 bps rate cut by the RBI in the upcoming policy,"" the report said.At present, the repo rate stands at 6.50 per cent and has remained unchanged for the past eleven consecutive meetings.Back in December, the MPC voted 5-1 to keep rates steady, prioritising economic stability while monitoring inflation trends. However, the central bank did cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 bps to 4 per cent, aiming to boost liquidity and credit growth.While most experts anticipate a 25 bps rate cut, they are also vouching for additional liquidity measures that may be necessary to ensure smooth cash flow in the banking system.A report by Emkay Research revealed that investors and market participants are looking for policy measures beyond a simple rate cut, amid ongoing liquidity concerns .For the financial year 2024-25, the RBI has projected India’s real GDP growth at 7.2 per cent, while the Economic Survey estimated it at 6.4 per cent, aligning with the forecast by the National Statistical Office’s (NSO).With these economic projections in mind, the RBI is expected to take a cautious approach to rate reductions, with future cuts dependent on evolving inflation trends and broader macroeconomic landscape.As the MPC’s decision nears, market participants will be closely watching governor Malhotra’s stance on rate cuts, liquidity management, and any additional measures aimed at fueling India's economic momentum.","Market experts believe this move aims to boost economic growth while maintaining inflation control.

""Our strategic reforms, including the expansion of auto-settled claims, simplified member profile changes, and enhanced KYC compliance, have significantly boosted EPFO's efficiency,"" he said.A key factor behind the increased claim settlements is the auto-claim settlement mechanism, which has drastically improved processing speed.

The introduction of a simplified transfer claim application has resulted in only 8% of claims now requiring both member and employer attestation, down from higher figures in the past. Notably, 48% of claims are now submitted directly by members, and 44% of transfer requests are processed automatically.Member profile corrections have also seen a significant improvement, with 97.2% of updates now self-approved by members.

Ratan Naval Tata will executors question one-third inheritor's claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ratan-naval-tata-will-executors-question-one-third-inheritors-claim/articleshow/117994112.cms,"MUMBAI: A potential dispute appears to be simmering over division of the Ratan Tata estate, with sources saying that one of the inheritors, Mohini Mohan Dutta , a former Tata group employee who shared a close bond with the late industrialist, now indicating that he expects a sizeable settlement. His demand is apparently at odds with estimates arrived at by the executors of Tata's will.As per Ratan Tata's will, Dutta, 74, shall receive one-third of his residual estate, comprising bank deposits exceeding Rs 350 crore and proceeds from auctioning personal belongings such as paintings and watches. Ratan Tata's half-sisters Shireen Jejeebhoy and Deanna Jejeebhoy will receive the remaining two-thirds of the residual estate. The sisters also serve as executors of his will following his passing in October 2024. The industrialist's primary assets, including shares in Tata and non-Tata firms, have been bequeathed to his two foundations.Sources indicated that while Dutta has signalled his acceptance of one-third share of the residual estate, he expects his bequest to be worth about Rs 650 crore, which has raised eyebrows among certain Tata stakeholders. Formal valuation of Tata's estate remains pending, but Dutta's share is unlikely to be as high as Rs 650 crore, said sources. The will is yet to be probated in Bombay High Court. When TOI contacted Dutta, he declined to discuss his beneficiary status or related issues.Tata stakeholders observed that while family members such as half-brother Noel Tata and his children do not find a mention in the will, and brother Jimmy Tata gets a share of his property worth Rs 50 crore, an external individual is seeking a higher settlement amount. Besides the half-sisters, Tata Trusts trustees Darius Khambata and Mehli Mistry are also executors of Ratan Tata's will.Dutta's initial encounter with Ratan Tata occurred in Jamshedpur, fostering a strong connection. This association led to Ratan Tata backing his career and other business interests.""We first met in Jamshedpur at the Dealers' Hostel when Ratan Tata was 24. He helped me out and really built me up,"" Dutta shared with journalists at Ratan Tata's October 2024 funeral, noting their 60-year association.Dutta started his career with Taj and later Tata Industries invested in Dutta's entrepreneurial venture, Stallion Travel Agency. This agency was later merged with Taj's travel division. Tata Capital subsequently acquired and sold the business to Thomas Cook (India). Now operating as TC Travel Services, Dutta continues as a director. He also received shares of Tata Group companies, including the IPO-bound Tata Capital.Dutta positioned himself as the industrialist's adopted son, according to old Tata guards. However, the will and codicil clarified that Ratan Tata never married nor adopted any children.","Mohini Mohan Dutta, a former Tata group employee, shared a close bond with the late industrialist.

A government order issued in 1989 also mandated that appointments to TTD-administered posts would be restricted to Hindus.The decision is supported by Article 16(5) of the Constitution, which allows institutions of a religious or denominational nature to employ members of their own religion. Similarly, Rule 3 of the AP Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Subordinate Service Rules states that employees of religious institutions must profess the Hindu faith.This legal backing was reinforced in November 2023 by Andhra Pradesh high court when it upheld Rule 3, confirming that trust boards are empowered to mandate service conditions, including the requirement that employees follow the Hindu religion.",TTD is an independent government trust that manages Tirumala Venkateswara temple in Tirupati.

Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.

Trump’s crypto policies



Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Bitcoin dropped from around $105,000 on Saturday to about $92,000 on Sunday night. However, it later recovered to over $100,000 on Monday after Trump paused tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods.While bitcoin showed some recovery, other cryptocurrencies saw larger losses. Ethereum , dogecoin, and other digital assets declined sharply. Trump’s own meme coin traded at around $19 on Monday, about 75 per cent below its peak when he launched it before his second inauguration.“These are riskier cryptos than bitcoin,” Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency analyst was quoted as saying by news agency Associated. “But it’s a little surprising how big the gap is.”Financial markets also saw major shifts before the tariffs were set to take effect. Trump warned that Americans might feel “some pain” from the tariffs but said the move was necessary. He also suggested that tariffs on the European Union and possibly the United Kingdom could follow.Bitcoin was created in 2009 as digital cash outside government control. Over the years, it has become more mainstream, with its price movements now closely tied to tech stocks.Meme coins, a more volatile part of the crypto market, have also seen sharp declines. First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin, launched before Trump took office, is down nearly 90% from its highest value.Trump, who was once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now embraced digital assets. He has promised to make the US a leader in crypto and has appointed officials supportive of the industry.Despite recent declines, cryptocurrencies have gained value since Trump’s election. Bitcoin remains close to its record high of $109,000.","Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.

Ecuador's conservative president announces tariffs on Mexican exports in an echo of Trump policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ecuadors-conservative-president-announces-tariffs-on-mexican-exports-in-an-echo-of-trump-policy/articleshow/117899381.cms,"Ecuador's conservative president said Monday that he is raising tariffs on Mexican imports in a move that echoes the trade barriers that U.S. President Donald Trump announced - but then paused - against Mexico.Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers. But the conservative leader may also be seeking favor with Washington, where the Trump administration said Saturday it would impose its own 25% tariffs on Mexico.Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced Monday that the tariffs would be halted for now to give the two sides more time to negotiate. Trump has demanded that Mexico do more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling across the border.Noboa, who took time away from a re-election campaign to attend Trump's inauguration last month in Washington, has hailed Trump's win as a victory for Latin America.Ecuador's announcement comes amid the South American country's separate and bitter diplomatic dispute with Mexico, which last year severed diplomatic ties after Ecuadorian police broke into the Mexican Embassy to arrest Ecuador's former Vice President Jorge Glas.Ecuador's move was widely condemned as a breach of international law, while Ecuador said that Glas was wanted for fraud and not for political reasons and accused Mexico of illegitimately granting him political asylum at the diplomatic compound.Trade between the two countries is minimal, however, accounting for less than 1% of Mexico's total exports, according to Mexican central bank data.Noboa, heir to a banana fortune, is running Sunday in elections for his first complete constitutional term after being elected 18 months ago to finish the aborted mandate of ex-President Guillermo Lasso.","Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers.

Asian stocks took a hit overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei tumbling 2.8 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 1 per cent.However, mainland Chinese markets remain closed until Wednesday due to the Lunar New Year holiday.European markets are bracing for further declines as investors assess the risk of a global trade war . The pound slipped 1 per cent against a stronger US dollar, trading just under $1.23, though it gained 0.4 per cent against the euro, which is also weighed down by the tariff war.Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, told The Mirror, financial markets are likely to react strongly to Trump’s tariff measures.

Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ether witnessed steep declines on Monday as rising tariff war tensions weakened investor sentiments. During early trade in Asia, Bitcoin fell to $94,476.18, briefly hitting a three-week low of $91,441.89.Ether saw an even steeper drop of 24 per cent, hitting its lowest level since September, to $2,494.33.The downturn extended into Sunday, with bitcoin slipping 7 per cent to $93,768.66, according to Coin Metrics.

Much of this rally was driven by expectations that his administration would introduce crypto-friendly policies, with Trump himself vowing to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet.""However, despite early optimism, some investors have grown impatient over the lack of concrete regulatory reforms. Last month, Trump ordered the formation of a cryptocurrency working group to explore potential regulations and even consider a national crypto reserve, but rigid policy changes remain absent.Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the ongoing tariff war could ultimately benefit bitcoin in the long run. ""“A sustained tariff war will be amazing for bitcoin in the long run due to an eventual weakening of the dollar and US rates."" he told ET.Analysts are keeping a close eye on the $90,000 support level for bitcoin, warning that a drop below this threshold could trigger a slide towards $80,000.

US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.The greenback recorded a major gain while weighing down Euro to a two year low and injuring the conventional safe haven Swiss frank to its lowest since May.However, two biggest trading partners for the States’ Canada and Mexico, wasted no time in vowing retaliation measures. China also condemned the move, claiming it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization, news agency Reuters reported.Last month after assuming office, Trump had threatened to hit Canada and Mexico with a 25 per cent tariff and while China stood at a levy of 10 per cent, alleging to combat issues like illegal immigration and drug trade.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, gained 0.11 per cent to 109.65 after hitting a three-week high previously in the session.The tariff news also shifted expectations for Federal Reserve policy . Traders scaled back bets on interest rate cuts, pricing in just 41 basis points of easing this year—down from 47 basis points previously.The US dollar climbed 0.7 per cent to 7.2552 yuan in offshore trading, after briefly hitting a record 7.3765 yuan. With Chinese markets closed for Lunar New Year, traders expect further volatility when trading resumes on Wednesday.It jumped 2.7 per cent to 21.40 Mexican pesos, the highest since March 2022.The Canadian dollar weakened 1.4 per cent to C$1.4755 per US dollar, a level last seen in 2003.It plunged 2.3 per cent to $1.0125, a low last recorded in November 2022, before a minor reverse back to $1.0257.It fell 0.74 per cent reaching $1.2304.Though global markets were tumbling down, the Japanese yen held firm at 155.50 per dollar.US economic data released on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, closely observed by the Federal Reserve—rose 0.3 per cent in the past month, the largest increase since April 2024. This suggests the Fed may be in no rush to resume cutting interest rates.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies took a hit. Bitcoin slid 4.4 per cent to $97,622, falling back below $100,000 for the first time in nearly three weeks. Ether tumbled 15 per cent to $2,812.8, its lowest level since early November.Donald Trump is expected to discuss the tariffs with Canada and Mexico, arguing that Americans may feel economic ""pain"" from the 25 percent duties but that it will be ""worth the price.""He informed news agency AFP of ""speaking with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau tomorrow morning, and I'm also speaking with Mexico tomorrow morning.""""I don't expect anything very dramatic,"" he added.China, Mexico and Canada are the top three US trade partners and all have vowed to retaliate when the tariffs take effect Tuesday.","US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.

The crypto market is a dynamic space conducive to growth and innovation. Here are four new crypto coins that demand attention this quarter.Whales are a constant challenge in the meme coin market. They try to manipulate meme coin prices by flexing their capital and leaving small investors to pick up the pieces. This has to change, declares Wall Street Pepe.The project is on a mission to bring down the whales and establish the supremacy of the WEPE Army, a growing community of retail investors. The community membership comes with exclusive access to trading signals, alpha calls, and market insights that help navigate the unpredictable crypto market.In essence, Wall Street Pepe combines humour with purpose to create a noteworthy meme coin project. WEPE’s record-breaking presale has raised over $58 million, attracting investors eager for more than just a quick laugh.While most meme coins ride on fleeting hype, WEPE has its eyes set on a long journey ahead. That’s what sets it apart from the crowd of new meme coins vying for attention. The platform is inspired by the wildly popular Pepe meme. However, unlike its inspiration, WEPE blends bold branding with practical value.The WEPE Army is creating a supportive community for both learning and earning. Weekly trading competitions, early presale access, and expert insights make it an attractive choice for crypto enthusiasts looking for an edge.The $WEPE presale is still live, offering discounted crypto tokens and a passive income mechanism.

He drew attention to the project’s standout features and why they could be a game-changer. Best Wallet is setting a new standard in crypto management.The Solana blockchain is popular, yes. But it is facing growing pains as its popularity soars. High demand has led to network congestion, delayed transactions, and increased fees.Solaxy is bringing the first Layer-2 solution to Solana. It takes a creative route to improve the blockchain’s performance. The platform uses roll-up technology to act as an off-ramp for Solana’s mainnet. The transactions are processed on a secondary chain, bundled together, and sent back for confirmation. Here is how it helps:The Solaxy ecosystem revolves around its native token, $SOLX. It powers not just transaction fees, but also governance mechanisms and passive rewards. Early investors can lock their tokens during the presale to earn attractive APYs.

Donald Trump Economy: Donald Trump inherits strong economy as US growth rate hits 2.8% in 2024 amid ongoing inflation concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-growth-data-donald-trump-inherits-strong-economy-as-us-growth-rate-hits-2-8-in-2024-amid-ongoing-inflation-concerns/articleshow/117746316.cms,"Consumer spending remains robust



Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected.

Tesla results miss estimates as company projects 2025 auto volume growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-results-miss-estimates-as-company-projects-2025-auto-volume-growth/articleshow/117716151.cms,"Full autonomy soon?

Tesla reported lower than expected profits Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.Revenues rose two percent to $25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla ""the most valuable company in the world by far,"" worth more than the ""next five companies combined.""Musk, who spent some $270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that ""with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.""The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.Tesla named its driver-assistance programs ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" (FSD), even though the programs require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.""But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it,"" Musk said. ""In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf.""Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.""Teslas will be in the wild,"" he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is ""unequivocally safer"" than a human driver.Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.The billionaire's widening influence and activism on behalf of far-right political movements has drawn rising attention and blowback. Polling data released Wednesday by YouGov showed Musk with a 44 percent favorable public opinion compared with a 48 percent negative.That's a worse ratio than Trump, who came in at three points net-positive, according to YouGov.A coalition that includes a public workers union has filed a lawsuit to block Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, arguing the panel flouts federal laws and is ""beset"" by the conflicts of interest of an extremist ""libertarian billionaire class.""And only days after being criticized for a hand gesture at Trump's inauguration that resembled a Nazi salute, Musk drew scrutiny last weekend for reiterating support for Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD party, including comments that young Germans should feel able ""to move beyond"" expressing regret for the Holocaust.During the call, Musk's most overtly political comment concerned what he described as the cumbersome process to introduce FSD in Europe, calling Europe ""a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed.""Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading.","Tesla reports fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"ITR filing deadline: Don’t miss December 31, 2024 deadline for revised, belated tax returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-deadline-dont-miss-december-31-2024-deadline-for-revised-belated-tax-returns-here-are-the-consequences/articleshow/116495382.cms,"If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.

ITR filing: What are the consequences of missing the belated return filing deadline on December 31, 2024?



ITR filing: What if you miss the revised return filing December 31, 2024 deadline?

ITR filing deadline : December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Whilst various taxpayer categories have distinct ITR filing deadlines, the final date for belated and revised returns remains the same. Many individuals remain unaware of the implications of missing the December 31, 2024, submission deadline for FY 2023-24.If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.Under Section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, belated returns incur a Rs 5,000 penalty, regardless of outstanding tax amounts. A reduced penalty of Rs 1,000 applies for lower taxable income. However, individuals with income below the Rs 3 lakh basic exemption limit face no penalties.Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary of Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, told ET, ""Belated return is the last chance for the taxpayer to file the ITR and claim refunds and certain losses. If the belated return is not filed, the person misses those claims and credits for that assessment year. After the expiry of the filing of the belated return, only an updated return can be filed subject to the condition that there is a tax liability payable. Further, if no belated return is filed, the taxpayer shall have to face increased interests and penalties on the tax liabilities if a notice is sent by the income tax department.""A significant limitation of filing belated returns for FY 2023-24 is the inability to select the old tax regime , as the new regime became default from April 1, 2023. Consequently, belated returns must follow the new tax regime .Also Read | Avoid Rs 10 lakh income tax penalty! Why it's important to report foreign income, assets in ITR by December 31, 2024 - check details The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime. These provisions helped reduce taxable income and subsequent tax obligations.The new regime permits only two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) and employer NPS contributions up to 10% of basic salary. Additional benefits like Section 80C, 80D, and HRA exemptions are not applicable under the new structure.When a taxpayer needs to rectify errors in original or belated returns, they must submit a revised return. This allows corrections of various oversights, such as unreported income, unclaimed deductions, or omitted bank account details.Bhuta says, ""If the taxpayer misses the deadline to file a revised return, there is no other mechanism to file a revised return again for that assessment year and to claim refunds or losses. The income tax laws allow the filing of an updated return. However, the updated return cannot be filed in cases where the taxpayer has losses, it results in an increased refund, or the tax return has an effect of reducing the total tax liability as filed in the original or belated return. There are many other criteria as to when an updated return cannot be filed. So, if a taxpayer misses the revised return deadline, the only way in which any additional claim or credit can be requested is during the assessment proceedings. However, that is subject to litigation.""Also Read | PAN 2.0: How to easily apply for PAN Card reprint with QR code - check 6 simple steps online Whilst taxpayers can submit multiple revised returns, tax experts advise against frequent revisions as this could trigger scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.Regarding intimation notices, Bhuta explains, ""As per section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ITR can be revised only before three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of assessment, whichever event happens first. The ITR can be revised even after an intimation has been received under section 143(1). However, once the ITR is processed under a regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3), the same cannot be revised.""For the financial year 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), taxpayers have until December 31, 2024, to submit their revised returns.","December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2016, specific consequences apply.

There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

"'NPAs may go up by 2026, write-offs signal stress'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/npas-may-go-up-by-2026-write-offs-signal-stress/articleshow/116808921.cms,"MUMBAI: Indian banks ' gross non-performing assets remained at a 12-year low of 2.6% of total assets as of September 2024. However, RBI's stress test projects the figure could rise to 3% by March 2026 under the baseline scenario. It has also expressed concern that a sharp rise in write-offs, particularly among private sector banks , could signal worsening asset quality.The stress test results, published in the bi-annual financial stability report released on Monday, indicate that in an adverse scenario, gross NPAs could further increase to 5%. Under the worst-case scenario (adverse scenario 2), gross NPAs could climb to 5.3%.""Credit risk is comparatively severe under adverse scenario 2. The GNPA ratios of public sector banks may rise from 3.3% in Sept 2024 to 7.3% in March 2026, whereas it may increase from 1.9% to 2.9% for private sector banks and from 0.9% to 1.4% for foreign banks,"" the report stated.The stress test results further reveal that the aggregate capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of 46 major scheduled commercial banks may decline slightly from 16.6% in Sept to 16.5% by March 2026 under the baseline scenario and to 15.7% under adverse scenario 2. No bank is projected to fall below the minimum capital requirement of 9% under these scenarios. However, under adverse scenario 1, the aggregate CRAR of SCBs may drop to 14.3%, with four banks potentially breaching the minimum capital requirement.The report also highlighted vulnerabilities in the Indian financial system, including stretched equity valuations, stress in the microfinance and consumer credit segments, and risks from external spillovers. ""An area of concern, however, is the sharp rise in write-offs, especially among private sector banks, which could partly mask worsening asset quality in this segment and dilution in underwriting standards,"" RBI noted. Fresh NPAs in retail loan portfolios were predominantly driven by slippages in unsecured loans, which accounted for 51.9% of new NPAs as of Sept 2024. Among bank groups, small finance banks are experiencing greater impairments in their retail lending portfolios, with a GNPA ratio of 2.7%, an SMA (1+2) ratio of 3.6%, and an unsecured GNPA ratio of 4.7%.The microfinance sector is also showing signs of stress, with rising delinquencies across various types of lenders and ticket sizes.Globally, the report flagged risks associated with ""tokenisation,"" the creation of digital representations of real-world assets using distributed ledger technology. While still in its early stages and presenting limited financial stability concerns, tokenisation could increase interconnectedness between traditional financial systems and decentralised platforms, including crypto-assets, with potential spillover effects on the broader financial system.","Indian banks'gross non-performing assets remained at a 12-year low of 2.6% of total assets as of September 2024.

EVs on discount as stock piles up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/evs-on-discount-as-stock-piles-up/articleshow/116809100.cms,"CHENNAI: It's discounts season in the electric vehicle market. Stock pile-ups, cheaper components and the pressure of CAFE norms have combined to bring big discounts to not only electric passenger vehicles but also electric two-wheelers. According to EV dealers, best-selling electric PVs like Nexon EV and XUV400 EV are offering discounts in the region of Rs 3 lakh. Electric two-wheelers are also offering between 10% to 20% off depending on models and variants.Some best-sellers, like the Hero Motocorp Vida V1 Pro and Vida V1 Plus for example, are offering cash discounts of Rs 25,000 and Rs 10,000 respectively. Even electric two-wheelers on Flipkart are offering between Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 in discounts. The Ather Rizta is attracting between Rs 3,000 to Rs 6,700 in benefits while the Ather 450 is attracting between Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 in benefits. Almost all electric two-wheelers are attracting discounts across the range.Typically, a lion's share of the EV discounts are borne by the OEMs, though dealerships are also pitching in, making this the best time to buy EVs . Exchange bonus on offer is as high as Rs 15,000 while trade discount is between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000, say sources. Industry experts say part of the discounts are residual leftovers from festival schemes. Others are the result of stock pile-up due to festival season overproduction.""Discounts and promotional offers were high in the entire auto sector during the festive and post-festive period amid high inventory at dealers' end (especially PVs),"" Srikumar Krishnamurthy, senior VP & co-group head (corporate ratings) at Icra, said. The scenario, he added, is not different in the global context as there has been a lower pace of growth in EV sales. ""While the pace of growth is slowing down, EV sales volumes are heading for another record year,"" he noted.According to Icra, the EV segment - which went from less than 2% in FY22 to around 5.5% in FY25 - will reach around 25% in case of two-wheelers and 15% in passenger vehicles by 2030.Auto experts say the reason for EV discounting has to do with the demands of the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms on companies.",Best-selling electric PVs like Nexon EV and XUV400 EV are offering discounts in the region of Rs 3 lakh.

This fund inflow is expected to address the group's liquidity requirements for its core infrastructure business.The group, through flagship Adani Enterprises and its wholly-owned subsidiary Adani Commodities, holds 44% in Adani Wilmar that owns the Fortune sunflower oil and Kohinoor basmati rice brands.Of the 44% the group owns, Wilmar will buy 31% at Rs 305 per share, increasing the Singaporean company's stake to 75% from 44% in the Mumbai-listed Adani Wilmar. The price is a 7.2% discount to Monday's close and values the portion being sold to Wilmar at $1.4 billion. Indian regulations require public shareholders to maintain a minimum 25% ownership, restricting promoters' share to 75%.The remaining 13% stake will be offered to the public through an offer for sale, with current public ownership at 12%.

Stock rally derailed this year... but stay invested through highs & lows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-rally-derailed-this-year-but-stay-invested-through-highs-lows/articleshow/116808843.cms,"MUMBAI: After touching record highs several times in 2024, the sensex and Nifty are about 10% off peak levels as several global and domestic factors weigh on investor sentiment. Debt and precious metals - gold and silver - markets too have been volatile. The markets' direction is not clear - so investors should beware of giving in to impulse while making investment decisions. Such calls could impact long-term gains.The proven prescription for creating wealth in the long run is the process of allocating one's investments into three popular asset classes: equity, fixed income, and gold & silver.Investors should keep in mind three things. First, with a proper asset allocation framework, set investment goals. They should also set a timeline. And then they should invest using SIPs, a mutual fund distributor said.Investment advisers expect the economy to struggle for the next few quarters - by extension a stock market rally may not be imminent, as Main Street & Dalal Street performances are closely linked. And as it happens in times of a subdued market, small and mid-cap stocks are expected to underperform while large-caps may prove resilient.""Retail investors would do better if they stick to large-cap and flexi-cap funds. Conservative investors could look at debt-oriented balanced advantage funds. The third category to look at in these times would be the multi-asset funds,"" Tanwir Alam of Fincart Finvest said.While large-cap funds invest only in blue chips and the leading companies, flexi-cap has a mix-and-match approach that invests across the market cap spectrum. Balanced advantage funds are schemes that try to balance their investment approach between debt and equity, depending upon the expectations about these assets. Meanwhile, multi-asset funds predominantly invest in equity and debt, but also maintain some exposure to gold.With the rupee showing weakness against the dollar and other major currencies, domestic gold prices are going up (due to link to international prices benchmarked to dollar). This is bringing in some extra profits for multi-asset funds.Alam also had another advice for retail investors: Don't stop your SIPs. The logic is that foreign funds are taking money out of India which, to some extent, is pulling the markets down and also leading to weakness of the rupee. ""In case foreign funds decide to come in and start investing in India in a big way, there would be a smart rally in the stock market. In case you stop your SIP, you could miss a substantial part of the rally.""","After touching record highs several times in 2024, the sensex and Nifty are about 10% off peak levels.

DHAKA: After its arch political rival Awami League , the Bangladesh Nationalist Party has taken on student leaders for attacking the 1972 constitution by using ""fascist"" language.Criticising leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement (ADSM), which led the July-Aug uprising to oust the Sheikh Hasina govt, senior BNP members emphasised that the constitution, formulated as a result of the 1971 Liberation War, was drafted at the cost of the ""blood of millions of martyrs"". ""Statements like 'bury it, kill it, cut it off' echo the language of fascism,"" BNP standing committee member Mirza Abbas said, adding that such remarks could lead to misinterpretation and division.On Sunday, ADSM convener Hasnat Abdullah said the 1972 constitution would ""effectively be buried on Dec 31"" with the 'Declaration of the July Revolution' - set to be presented by student leaders at the Central Shaheed Minar. ""We demand the 'Mujibbadi Constitution' be declared obsolete"" he had said, adding that the declaration will render the ""Nazi-like Awami League irrelevant in Bangladesh"".Mirza underscored the importance of the constitution, calling it a product of the Liberation War and not something that can simply be discarded. ""If there is any flaw in the Constitution, it can be amended,"" he said.Another BNP member, Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, accused certain political groups, including those which opposed the Liberation War, of attempting to exploit the current political climate for their own benefit.","Bangladesh Nationalist Party criticises student leaders for attacking 1972 constitution.

Besides, he sought urgent attention on skilling and making life easier through presumptive tax mechanism for small businesses and data centres, among others.In its representation, Ficci proposed that Sitharaman continue with the work started on rationalisation of TCS and TDS rates, and suggested that govt should stop these deductions and collections for items that are already part of the GST chain as data for these transactions is already available.Besides, it has recommended several measures to promote daycare and childcare benefits for women, including tax exemption for those with children up to a certain age.

Snakes are often viewed with a combination of fascination and fear, mainly because of their possibly dangerous venom and sometimes elusive nature. However, it must be said that most snake species are not aggressive and tend to avoid human contact. Only a few species, such as the King Cobra , are venomous enough to pose a serious threat to humans. There are many myths and misconceptions surrounding snakes, such as far-out claims about the time of their lifespan. Let's take a deep dive into the life cycle and lifespan of snakes to get the good stuff about how long they live and what contributes to their ability to live such long periods.The king cobra, known as the longest venomous snake, has an average lifespan of 20 to 25 years in the wild. In its natural habitat, its life expectancy can be influenced by factors such as predation, food availability, and environmental conditions. However, when kept in captivity under optimal care, including proper diet and medical attention, king cobras can live longer, often reaching up to 30 years. This extended lifespan in controlled environments is typical for many snake species, as captivity reduces exposure to the dangers and challenges they face in the wild.The general lifespan of most species averages out at about 8 to 10 years, but can vary widely, taking into account factors such as the species, environment, and food availability, along with the presence of predators. For example, snakes in the wild usually don't live very long at all because they face such a variety of dangers. In contrast, snakes in a captive environment generally live much longer because they are not exposed to risks and have regular feeding with medical care.Boa constrictors are among the longest living snakes, surviving up to 40 years in the confines of captivity. These large snakes tend to survive longer in captivity than their wild counterparts because they are preserved in a controlled environment in which they encounter fewer threats and greater access to food.Another long-living snake is the reticulated python that can live up to 30 years in captivity. These giant constrictors require large spaces and proper care, and they often live longer lives in captivity than in the wild.Cobras, like the Indian cobra (Naja naja), usually survive around 15 to 20 years in the wild. In captivity, because they are provided with care, they can live up to 25 years.Garter snakes are small, non-venomous snakes that are found throughout North America. They typically live 5 to 10 years in the wild. They have a relatively short lifespan compared to larger snakes because of natural predators and environmental risks.The maximum lifespan of a snake varies considerably with the species. Snakes that are kept in a controlled environment can live for several decades, while other species have only survived for a few years in their natural habitat. The oldest recorded snake was a boa constrictor that lived more than 40 years in a zoo.It should be known that it is totally a false suggestion of the idea of living hundreds or thousands of years of snakes as some myths and folklore often tend to tell. The oldest snakes live only for between 30 to 40 years, and no species lives longer than that.How long a snake lives depends on quite a number of factors, including:To understand the lifespan of snake, one needs to start with the understanding of the life cycle. Snakes, like any other living creature, undergo various clearly defined stages of development before it reaches maturity. The main stages of the snake's life cycle are divided into three stages: egg, juvenile or hatchling, and adult. The duration of these stages might vary depending on the species, but the overall process is common for all snakes.Most snakes have a life cycle that begins with egg-laying, although a few species of snakes will give birth to live young rather than laying eggs, referred to as ovoviviparity. The specific method of egg-laying is different from species to species, although generally, a female snake will lay 10 to 15 eggs at one time. In the case of some species, such as the reticulated python, that number can be even larger.Once she has laid the eggs, she may or may not incubate them depending on the species. For example, a python coils around the eggs to protect them and to keep them at the appropriate temperature, while garter snakes lay their eggs and go. The eggs generally take about 40 to 70 days to hatch; however, this can range widely. In some boas and pythons, eggs can take a period of 90 days before hatching, while other species may hatch in just 30 days. The temperature of the surroundings is what determines the length of time it takes for the eggs to hatch.After hatching, baby snakes, known as sapoles or hatchlings, emerge from their eggs and begin their independent life. Most baby snakes are about 10 to 30 centimeters long at birth, and despite their small size, they are capable of feeding themselves almost immediately after hatching. Their diet typically consists of small insects, amphibians, and other tiny creatures.Unlike many mammals, snakes do not receive parental care after birth. Instead, they must fend for themselves. Their foremost aim in the first year of life is to grow, shed, and find their own food. As a matter of fact, the growth rate of snakes during their very first year can be pretty dramatic; a few species go on to fourfold their initial size within just the first year. This fast growth is, therefore, crucial to their survival as they get out of a size at which they cannot avoid many of the predators that pose danger to them.Once a snake reaches its maturity, the snake becomes an adult. Since different species of snakes exist, maturity ages vary widely. A garter snake may take only 2 years to reach maturity, but larger snakes, such as pythons and boas, may take up to 4 years.Snakes are able to reproduce at adulthood. At this stage, they can mate and lay eggs or give birth to live young. In addition to mating, adult snakes need to hunt and survive in their given environment. Some species may even begin hunting other snakes, especially with larger predators like the king cobra-their species is known to have been preyed upon. A mature snake grows further, although it increases at a far reduced rate as compared to an immature one. Adult snakes shed periodically a method termed as ecdysis. During their lifetime, most snakes have shed their skins 2 to 4 times every year, except due to rapid growth, environmental conditions that require different changes in this habit might be observed sometimes.","Snakes are often viewed with fascination and fear, mainly because of their possibly dangerous venom and sometimes elusive nature.

This reversal from 2023's record safety is marked by several tragic incidents, possibly exacerbated by global conflicts. Fatal aviation accidents, though rare, have surged this year.

Commercial aviation has suffered its deadliest year since 2018 after the Jeju Air disaster in South Korea and last week's downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane. Onboard passenger plane fatalities this year jumped to 318 with the two recent crashes, data compiled by Cirium shows. That's by far the highest death toll since more than 500 people died in 2018, a year marked by the first of two Boeing Co. 737 Max crashes. It marks a reversal from 2023 - the safest year ever in aviation with no deaths among large passenger jetliners. Fatal aviation accidents remain very rare.In Jan, a Japan Airlines jet collided with a coastguard plane at Tokyo airport. Everyone aboard the jetliner survived, but five people on the smaller aircraft were killed. In July, Nepal's Saurya Airlines crashed after taking off, killing 18. And in Aug dramatic footage of a plane operated by Brazilian airline VoePass captured its freefalling from the sky after encountering icy weather conditions. That accident killed 62. Global conflicts may also have contributed to this year's fatalities. The Azerbaijan Airlines jet had nearly completed a scheduled flight from the capital city of Baku to Grozny, Russia, on Dec. 25 when it was suddenly diverted across the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan.

Closure Of Bench Accounting: Bench Accounting Vancouver bookkeeping service shuts down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-based-bench-accounting-announces-sudden-closure-putting-hundreds-out-of-work/articleshow/116734374.cms,"Representative image

Former CEO speaks out

Competitors step in

Canada's Vancouver-based bookkeeping service Bench Accounting has announced its unexpected closure, leaving hundreds of employees without jobs and forcing thousands of customers to seek alternatives just days before the end of the year.In a statement posted on its website, Bench, which has described itself as North America's largest bookkeeping service for small businesses , revealed that as of Friday, the platform was ""no longer accessible."" The company acknowledged the abrupt nature of the closure, emphasizing that it would assist customers through the transition.As per CBC News, Bench had previously reported having over 600 employees and more than 12,000 US-based customers. The company had raised $113 million in investor funding. Initially founded as 10sheet Inc. in the US in 2012, Bench relocated to Vancouver and rebranded in 2013.With the unexpected shutdown, the company has outlined the steps its customers need to take to retrieve their data. They will be notified by December 30 and will be able to download their current and prior year-end financials, along with uploaded documents like receipts and bank statements, until March 7. Customers are advised to file for a tax extension to allow extra time to find a new bookkeeper to file their taxes.Calls to Bench’s Vancouver office went unanswered, with the line going directly to voicemail. In light of the closure, local officials expressed sympathy for the affected workers. British Columbia's minister of jobs, economic development, and innovation, Diana Gibson, extended her thoughts to those losing their jobs, especially during the holidays.She acknowledged that the province’s strong financial tech sector would continue to receive government support but noted that no further information about the reasons behind Bench's closure was available at this time, as reported by the Vancouver Sun.The closure has sparked a reaction from Bench’s former CEO and co-founder, Ian Crosby , who was ousted by the company's board three years ago. Crosby expressed his sadness over the company's fate and shared his perspective on the closure, which he sees as a cautionary tale for venture capitalists .“I hope the story of Bench goes on to become a warning for VCs (venture capitalists) that think they can ‘upgrade’ a company by replacing the founder. It never works,” Crosby said on social media.Crosby, a University of British Columbia Sauder Business School alumnus, recalled his battle with board members over their strategy for a “new direction” in 2021, which he believed would lead to the company’s downfall. He added that rather than continuing to fight, he chose to resign when he was replaced by a new leadership team.Kaz Nejatian, the COO of Shopify, which was an investor in Bench, also supported Crosby's view. ""Bad investors destroyed a great Canadian company by replacing the founder with so-called professionals,"" Nejatian wrote on social media, echoing Crosby's sentiments.As Bench’s sudden closure leaves many businesses scrambling for alternatives, rival bookkeeping companies such as Acuity and Better Bookkeeping have reached out to Bench's former clients, offering their services through social media campaigns.Some have even responded to complaints from former Bench customers, offering solutions for those affected by the disruption.The closure of Bench Accounting has left many small business owners grappling with the uncertainty of finding a new bookkeeping service, just as the year-end tax filing deadline approaches.","Vancouver-based bookkeeping service Bench Accounting has announced its unexpected closure.

Wall Street rises as ‘Santa Claus Rally’ begins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-rises-as-santa-claus-rally-begins/articleshow/116645609.cms,"Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year.

Corporate highlights:

American Airlines Group Inc said a technical vendor glitch was the cause of a brief groundstop on all US flights on Christmas Eve, one of the busiest days of the holiday travel season.

Nippon Steel Corp’s proposed $12.3 billion acquisition of US Steel Corp. moved a step closer to being blocked after a US national security panel deadlocked on its review and left the final decision with President Biden, who has repeatedly indicated his opposition to the deal.

Salesforce Inc says it’s taking multiple large customers from former partner Veeva Systems Inc. in a mounting rivalry to sell software to the pharmaceutical industry.

A Starbucks Corp barista strike has shut down about 170 cafes, according to the coffee chain, disrupting service at locations nationwide during the final days of the crucial holiday shopping season.

Arcadium Lithium Plc, a chemicals company, said it obtained all shareholder approvals for a proposed acquisition by Rio Tinto Plc.

The S&P 500 rose 1.1%

The Nasdaq 100 rose 1.4%

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%

The MSCI World Index rose 0.9%

Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index rose 2.1%

The Russell 2000 Index rose 1%

A rally in the group that has led Wall Street ’s gains in 2024 lifted stocks in a relatively quiet session ahead of Christmas.Following a strong day for big tech, the shares continued to power ahead on Tuesday. Tesla Inc. led megacaps higher. Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. climbed as President Joe Biden’s team launched a probe into Chinese-made chips. In a shortened pre-holiday session, the S&P 500“The action of the past few weeks shows that the big-cap tech names are still the key leadership group in today’s stock market,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “These big-tech names are highly overweighted in the portfolios of a huge number of institutional investors. Any buying they do over the next week is likely to be concentrated in these names.”Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year and the first two of the new one. This time around that window started Tuesday.“Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year,” said London Stockton at Ned Davis Research.Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated average and median returns of 1.3% during this period, widely outpacing the market’s average seven-day gain of 0.3%, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.“When investors are on the ‘nice’ list, and Santa delivers a ‘positive’ Santa Claus Rallyreturn, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.59%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index barely budged.While a positive “Santa Claus Rally” has preceded a 10.4% average annual gain for the S&P 500 since World War II, Sam Stovall at CFRA says a more accurate indicator in his view is the “January Barometer.”That’s a market hypothesis positing that January’s performance predicts the year’s performance. The term was coined by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, in 1972.Since 1945, when the year started with a gain in January, the S&P 500 rose an average of 18.3% in price during the entire year, Stovall at CFRA said. If the first month saw a decline in price, however, the average full-year return was negative 1.9%.With the market up over 25% this year and no corrections of more than 10%, the S&P 500 has managed to stay solidly above its 200-day moving average for the entirety of 2024, noted Bespoke Investment Group strategists.“Barring a significant market selloff in the last few trading days of the year, this will be the 12th year since 1952 (when we went to the current 5-day trading week at the NYSE) that the S&P has traded above its 200-DMA all year,” they said.The average next-year change following these years has been a gain of just 4.6% compared to the average gain of 9.2% for all years, Bespoke noted.Last week, Bank of America Corp. clients were large net buyers of US equities, according to strategist Jill Carey Hall. They bought American shares for the seventh consecutive week.Similar to the prior five weeks, clients bought both single stocks and exchange-traded funds, with bigger inflows into the former, she noted. Flows were primarily in large caps.Investors should have a more-balanced approach in US stocks over the first quarter, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Scott Chronert, who see a greater opportunity in defensive sectors.They raised health care to overweight, noting valuations are now lower and fundamentals seem close to inflection point. Meantime, they are selective on growth stocks, looking for stronger fundamental trend versus valuation and potential margin improvement.Citi’s strategists are overweight in media, internet and semiconductors, while raising software to market weight.",The S&P 500 rose 1.1%.

The battle of the top performing L1 blockchains has been pretty wild this year, with the likes of ETH, SOL, TRX, BNB, Toncoin (TON) and Cardano (ADA) fighting to claim the leadership mantle. However, out of all these networks, TON blockchain is showing huge promise as it records approximately 200% gains.Conversely, Cardano network is also making waves, especially as its new Hydra scalability solution is set to potentially unlock 1 million TPS. On the other hand, predictions about a fast-rising presale star– Lunex Network (LNEX) are blowing up as it shows the potential of overthrowing TON and ADA in 2025.Over the past year and counting, TON blockchain has been widely popular for one major thing— blockchain lucrative games. The partnership between Toncoin and Telegram to bring mini-games to millions of users was a very profitable one.From launching several tap-to-earn games to furthering its expansion in P2E games, Toncoin has been able to rack up approximately 200% NET gains . As experts rank Toncoin (TON) alongside cryptos to buy , analysts are starting to give bullish predictions.Although TON price is currently down by 11% as it trades within a weekly range of $6.6 and $5.9, the network is still receiving positive sentiment. X aanalyst, Crypto King particularly sighted a short term prediction of $10 for Toncoin. While this may seem far-fetched from the current price, the token’s 50, 100, and 200 moving averages points at a strong buy.Since its founder, Charles Hoskinson met up with President Donald Trump for the sake of enhancing crypto adoption, Cardano has been buzzing alongside otherDeFi coins . Cardano price now sits at a weekly range of $$0.98 and $1.28, 70% jump from its price in the past month. However experts believe this is just the starting.During a recent Cardano market dip, whales took the opportunity to accumulate 130 million ADA token, signaling huge bullish sentiment and strong confidence. Owing to this several investors are positive for Cardano network.Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst and expert has sparked more optimism recently. In a very recent tweet. Ali emphasized on how he will keep buying ADA even if it dips to $0.7 as he expects a further surge to $4 or $6 for Cardano.As a fast, secure and non-custodial DeFi project with robust features to facilitate effortless cross chain transactions, it won’t be surprising for Lunex Network (LNEX) to challenge top DeFi coins. The new altcoin project has already accumulated over $5.4 million in revenue after selling over 2.3 billion of its presale supply. Such buying interest only speaks of its potential to deliver immeasurable returns when it launches on DEX platforms.However, asides the numbers, Lunex Network has more growth potential embedded in its ecosystem and practical use. For starters, the platform allows investors to swap up to 50,000 cryptocurrencies across multi chains by connecting isolated blockchains together. Additionally, users can invest in its LNEX tokens and earn up to 18% APY in passive income when they engage in its staking pool.Furthermore, there’s a reward system where the platform gives half of its revenue to users while preserving the other half for more exclusive rewards. Alongside this, Lunex Network helps investors track their portfolio while delivering updated market insights. The platform also grants cashback rewards on every transaction, allowing users to earn more by actively using the network. With over 300% spike, its LNEX token is now valued at $0.0048 from an initial $0.0012.The practical uses and diversity that Lunex Network brings as an exchange platform is enough to contend with the likes of Toncoin. Although TON has seen huge developments as a mothering network to several other cryptocurrencies, Lunex Network’s intricate design catered for crypto investors, business owners and Web3 development makes it stand out as a tough contender. This put LNEX token on the radar of top cryptos to buy.You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:Website: https://lunexnetwork.com Socials: https://linktr.ee/lunexnetwork","Lunex Network (LNEX) is primed for a staggering growth above most DeFi coins.

Together, they would achieve sufficient scale to compete against Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG. Toyota maintains technological partnerships with Japanese firms Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.Honda's chief executive, Toshihiro Mibe, indicated that both companies would seek to consolidate their operations under a shared holding structure, with Honda initially directing the new management while maintaining individual company identities and brands. They plans to finalise a merger agreement by June and complete the transaction, including listing the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, by August 2026.Japanese automotive manufacturers have fallen behind major competitors in electric vehicle development and are seeking cost reductions while attempting to recover lost ground.Earlier this month, speculation emerged about potential collaboration, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that discussions were partially influenced by Taiwan's Foxconn's interest in acquiring Renault SA's Nissan shares.Meanwhile, Nissan's chief executive Makoto Uchida confirmed no direct communication from Foxconn, while acknowledging Nissan's ""severe"" circumstances.However, even after merger, Toyota will remain Japan's dominant automotive manufacturer, having produced 11.5 million vehicles in 2023. The three combining companies would collectively manufacture approximately 8 million vehicles. During 2023, Honda manufactured 4 million units, Nissan 3.4 million, and Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.Earlier in August, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced their intention to join hands on electric vehicle components and autonomous driving software research, following an initial agreement between Nissan and Honda in March.Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions said that Honda could benefit from Nissan's truck-based SUVs like the Armada and Infiniti QX80, while gaining from Nissan's expertise in battery technology, electric vehicles and hybrid powertrains.Earlier, Nissan announced layoffs affecting 9,000 staff globally in November, alongside a 20% reduction in production capacity, after reporting losses of 9.3 billion yen.

Google proposes fix to solve search monopoly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/google-proposes-fix-to-solve-search-monopoly/articleshow/116551583.cms,"WASHINGTON: Google said Friday what it thought should change to address a ruling that it had illegally maintained a monopoly over online search: not much.It follows the landmark ruling in Aug by judge Amit P Mehta of the US district court for the district of Columbia, who said Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple and Samsung to be the search engine that automatically appears when users open a web browser or a smartphone. The govt then asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular browser, among other remedies.In Google's own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement. But it said those agreements should be less restrictive than in the past.Apple, for example, could select different search engines to come up automatically for iPhone and iPad users, said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's VP of regulatory affairs, in a blog post. Cellphone makers using Google's popular operating system, Android, could also install multiple search engines and could install other Google apps without installing its search tool or its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant product.""We don't propose these changes lightly,"" she said.

Britannica didn't just survive. It's an AI company now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/britannica-didnt-just-survive-its-an-ai-company-now/articleshow/116551465.cms,"For nearly 250 years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a bookshelf-busting series of gilt-lettered tomes, often purchased to show that its owners cared about knowledge. It was the sort of physical media expected to die in the internet era, and indeed, the encyclopedia's publisher announced that it was ending the print edition in 2012. Skeptics wondered how Britannica the company could survive in the age of Wikipedia. The answer was to adapt to the times.Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries. It also sells artificial intelligence agent software that underpins apps like customer service chatbots and data retrieval.Britannica has figured out not only how to survive, but also how to do well financially. Jorge Cauz, its CEO, said in an interview that the publisher enjoyed pro forma profit margins of about 45%.The company is weighing an initial public offering, in which it could seek a valuation of about $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations.That could provide a sizable return for the company's owner, Swiss financier Jacob E Safra, who acquired the publisher in 1995 and, in a lawsuit filed in 2022, cited an investment bank in valuing Britannica at $500 million. The company says its websites draw over 7 billion annual page views a year, with users in more than 150 countries.Britannica has come far from its origins in the 18th century as the publisher of a reference work put together by three Scottish printers. Over the years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica became a heavyweight of the knowledge business, both literally - the 32-volume 2010 edition, the last to run in print, weighed 129 pounds - and figuratively, drawing on contributions from thousands of experts. It also became an aspirational status symbol, with customers paying nearly $1,400 for that edition.By the time the last Encyclopaedia Britannica was printed, the company had already started its suite of websites and educational software. Now it sees even greater opportunity in the growth of generative AI tools , which the company says can help make learning more dynamic - and therefore more desirable.Cauz said Britannica had experimented with the technology over the past few decades. It acquired Melingo, the company that makes its AI agent software, in 2000 because of its strength in natural language processing and machine learning. And it has two technology teams, based in Chicago and in Tel Aviv.The vertiginous popularity of chatbots like ChatGPT convinced executives that they needed to invest more in the space. Britannica now uses AI in creating, fact-checking and translating content for its products, including the online encyclopedia. It also created a Britannica chatbot that draws on its online encyclopedia's stores of information, which Cauz said was more likely to be accurate than the more generalised chatbots that could be prone to ""hallucinations.""The firm has more projects powered by generative AI in the pipeline: an English-language tutoring software that will use the tech to power avatars and customise lessons for each student, a program to help teachers create lesson plans, and a revamped thesaurus for the Merriam-Webster website that can handle phrases, not just words.","Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam- Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

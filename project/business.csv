What are the new bank nomination rules? Top points

According to the revised provisions, account holders can nominate up to four individuals, either simultaneous or in succession - a step that will facilitate a straightforward claim settlement process for both depositors and nominees.

Account holders have the choice to select either simultaneous or successive nominations based on their requirements.

Up to four nominees can be designated by depositors, with specific allocation of shares or percentages for each, totalling 100 per cent, which ensures clear distribution amongst all nominees.

For deposits, articles in safe custody, or lockers, individuals can specify up to four nominees. The subsequent nominee becomes active only after the death of the higher-placed nominee, ensuring seamless settlement and succession clarity.

For items kept in safe custody and safety deposit lockers, the regulations permit only successive nominations.





New bank nomination rules 2025: There is good news for bank customers! From November 1, 2025 you can now add up to four nominees to your bank accounts. From November 2025, banking customers will have the flexibility to opt for up to four nominees for their accounts. The move is aimed at standardising and streamlining claim settlements across banks.According to a PTI report, the finance ministry has said that key nomination provisions within the Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2025 will come into effect from November 1, 2025.The Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2025, which was notified on April 15, 2025, includes 19 amendments across five legislative frameworks: the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, Banking Regulation Act, 1949, State Bank of India Act, 1955, and Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 and 1980.These provisions allow depositors flexibility in making nominations according to their preferences, whilst maintaining uniformity, transparency and efficiency in claim settlements across the banking sector.The Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 2025, which will outline procedures and forms for making, cancelling, or designating multiple nominations, will be issued to implement these provisions across banks.""The central government had earlier appointed August 1, 2025 as the date on which certain provisions of the said Amendment Act, namely Sections 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, came into force vide Gazette Notification S.O. 3494(E) dated 29th July 2025,"" it said.","Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2025 will come into effect from November 1, 2025.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices sustained their bullish trajectory for the fourth consecutive week, propelled by robust global market cues and strong Q2FY26 earnings momentum. Additionally, renewed optimism surrounding the advanced stages of India–US trade pact negotiations further underpinned investor sentiment and amplified risk-on appetite across equities.The Nifty extended its winning streak for the sixth consecutive session on Thursday, closing at a fresh 52-week high near the 25,900 marks. However, it’s noteworthy that after a sharp 1,500-point rally over the past four weeks, the stochastic oscillator on both daily and weekly charts has entered the overbought zone. This suggests the potential for a short-term consolidation or corrective pause at higher levels — a healthy development that could set the stage for the next leg of the uptrend.Given the prevailing global volatility and the ongoing earnings season, any dip from current levels should be viewed as a buying opportunity to accumulate fundamentally robust counters with strong earnings visibility. On the downside, the zone of 25,500–25,700 is expected to act as a strong demand area, coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the ongoing rally (24,587–25,782) and the recent breakout region — thus providing a solid technical support base.Our constructive outlook is further reinforced by the following developments: After the strong performances in the Auto and Metal sectors, the Bank Nifty has now registered a fresh all-time high, signaling renewed sectoral strength. This broad-based participation is expected to lend additional momentum to the benchmark Nifty, potentially propelling it towards 26,277 — the prior all-time high — and subsequently to 26,600 in the coming month, which represents the measured move target derived from the breakout of the three-month symmetrical triangle consolidation pattern.Key Factors to Monitor Going Forward:Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows in all time frames. The index during the week has rallied to a fresh all-time high of 58577 levels.Going forward, the index is expected to sustain its upward trajectory, with immediate support placed at 57,500-57600 levels being the last week breakout area and a stronger demand zone seen near 56,800-56,500 levels.On the higher side, resistance is envisaged around 59000 levels being the 138.2% retracement of the entire previous decline (57628-53561).From an oscillator perspective, the Stochastic indicator has reversed upward and is nearing the overbought territory, suggesting a possible phase of consolidation with a positive undertone.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling supply line joining highs of the last 2-3 months signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is seen sustaining above the 20- & 50-days EMA highlighting short term momentum returning in the stock. It has immediate support at current week low of 144.We expect the stock to move higher towards 168 levels in the coming month being the 50% retracement of the entire decline of last 4 months (198-136)The stock is forming base at the 80% retracement of the previous major up move of May-June 2025 and has witnessed a shallow retracement of its previous up move signaling overall positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to resume its move and head towards 380 levels in the coming month being the confluence of the 200 day EMA and 50% retirement of the previous decline (417-337).Among the oscillators the daily 14 periods RSI is in up move and is sustaining above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 24, 2025 are Inox Wind, and Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services.

"Reliance, PSU refineries look to suspend Russian oil imports on US curbs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-psu-refineries-look-to-suspend-russian-oil-imports-on-us-curbs/articleshow/124767849.cms,"Representational AI image

""They are going to stop..."" Trump Reiterates Claim That India Is Cutting Down Russian Oil Imports





NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports after the US on Wednesday sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, the largest exporters of those barrels.Reliance, the single-largest Indian consumer of Russian oil, will be the biggest loser as it buys most of those barrels directly from Rosneft under a term contract. Russian crude makes up about half of the feed at the company's 35-million-tonne complex.“Recalibration of Russian oil imports is ongoing and Reliance will be fully aligned to GOI (Government of India) guidelines,” a Reliance spokesman told Reuters.The curbs on Rosneft will also make life harder for Nayara Energy, which is half owned by the Russian giant and struggling to stay afloat since September when the EU imposed sanctions. Analysts said selling products from its 20-million-tonne refinery at Gujarat's Vadinar will be tough.Importers can receive contracted shipments till November 21. Unlike previous sanctions, when Russian oil could be traded within the $60 price cap, this time the curbs are directed at the companies, making their barrel tainted after the cut-off date.So far this year, 36% of India’s crude has been from Russia, with Rosneft and Lukoil supplying nearly 60% of this.A senior executive of IndianOil, one of the largest consumers of Russian oil among state-run refiners, said those barrels make up 15-18% of their crude basket.“It is too early. We are looking at the fine print. But it will not be too difficult to arrange alternative supplies from West Asia or other geographies such as Africa, the US etc. But others will also be crowding those markets, which will jack up benchmark prices and premia on other crude. This will impact margins. But Russian oil somehow finds its way into the market as we have seen in the past… but banking issues may crop up,” he said.Sure enough, benchmark Brent crude price shot up 5%, or by $2.9 a barrel, to 65.50 on Thursday. ""The good thing is prices are in their 60s. Even if they rise to $70, it will be manageable.""US President Donald Trump has been mounting pressure on countries such as India and China to lower oil imports from Russia as part of a plan to squeeze Moscow to come to the negotiating table on the Ukraine conflict. Trump imposed secondary tariffs of 25% on India, in addition to 25% reciprocal tariffs, citing Russian crude purchases.Late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hit back at the US. “This is, of course, an attempt to put pressure on Russia. But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure.” He said breaking the balance in the global energy markets could lead to a hike in prices that would be uncomfortable for countries such as the US.As a country, the loss of discounted Russian oil could potentially cost India, which meets 85% of its crude requirement through imports, an estimated annual savings of about $4-5 billion on its oil import bill. Ratings agency ICRA estimates that replacement supplies at market prices would increase the oil import bill by 2%, potentially impacting the macroeconomic parameters.Sumit Ritolia, analyst at global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler, said the term arrangement with Rosneft could “introduce some near-term friction, especially from a compliance standpoint for RIL. The company would understandably wish to avoid any exposure to OFAC (US Office of Foreign Assets Control) and it will need to look at its Russian crude strategy.”The immediate operational impact on state-run refiners, he said, ""should remain limited"" as they buy Russian crude through tender from third-party traders. “However, secondary sanctions related to logistics and financing could pose indirect challenges.”","Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports.

Gold price prediction today:Gold prices witnessed a subdued move in early trading, hovering near ₹1,23,500 levels after facing resistance around the upper Bollinger Band. The price structure indicates consolidation within a narrow range as market participants await fresh triggers.The 8 EMA has flattened and is converging towards the 21 EMA, hinting at a loss of short-term momentum, while prices are currently holding marginally above the previous day’s pivot zone near ₹1,23,400 — acting as a key intraday support.RSI has slipped to around 39, reflecting weakening momentum and suggesting that the bulls are losing grip after recent gains.

'TERMINATED': Huge Escalation Between Canada & U.S; Trump Retaliates After Carney Junks America





US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he is halting all trade negotiations with Canada, citing television advertisements he said were intended to influence American court decisions.President Trump described the ads as “egregious behavior” and accused Canada of misusing footage of former President Ronald Reagan . “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,” he said in a post on Truth Social.“Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump added.Earlier this week, Trump said he had seen the ad on television and interpreted it as evidence that his tariffs were making an impact.The move follows remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who said he plans to double Canada’s exports to markets outside the US in response to the threat posed by Trump’s tariffs.The advertisement, launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government for $75 million highlights former President Ronald Reagan’s warning about the harm of tariffs.The 60-second TV spot features workers, such as welders and bakers, as well as families, while using Reagan’s 1987 radio address, in which he stated that trade barriers hurt all American workers and consumers, as cited by the Globe and Mail.“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” Reagan says.“Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs. Throughout the world, there’s a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition,” Reagan says in the advertisement.Ford revealed the $ 75 million price tag for the ads during a speech earlier this month at the Empire Club of Canada luncheon in downtown Toronto. He added that the province plans to deliver the message “to every Republican district” across the United States.“We’re just going to speak the truth,” Ford said. “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad. It’s actually just very factual. Coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”The Ronald Reagan Foundation dismissed the ad as a ""misrepresentation"" and said it is reviewing legal options to challenge its use.“The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal option in this matter,” the Foundation said through a post on X.","US President Donald Trump announced that he is halting all trade negotiations with Canada.

Dhanteras 2025:

But will this rally continue? Are gold and silver good investment bets over the next year? We ask experts what the gold and silver price outlook is and what levels will they hit by Dhanteras 2026:

Dhanteras 2025: Should you buy gold and silver this year?

What’s the gold price outlook till next Dhanteras?

Gold — Diwali/Dhanteras 2026 target: ₹1,40,000–₹1,45,000+ Bull case 160000+ if geopolitical risk escalates or Fed turns very dovish. For the 12-month horizon to Dhanteras 2026, maintaining the bullish structural view, expect upside if the macro tailwinds persist — Fed cuts, weak dollar, tariffs/ geopolitical premium.Since the price has shown sharp up move recently, its advisable to allocate in dips and parts.

Silver — Dhanteras/Diwali 2026 target: ₹1,85,000–₹2,10,000/kg; Bull case ₹2,20,000–₹2,50,000+ on stronger industrial demand Central banks buying and continued ETF flows.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"
Social security benefits to rise 2.8%: Retirees to see $56 monthly boost; senior citizens say increase not enough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/social-security-benefits-to-rise-2-8-retirees-to-see-56-monthly-boost-senior-citizens-say-increase-not-enough/articleshow/124792596.cms,"Social security benefits to rise 2.8% (AP)





The Social Security administration on Friday announced that its benefits will increase by 2.8% in 2026, giving retirees an average monthly boost of more than $56. The rise reflects moderating inflation after several years of higher cost-of-living adjustments (COLA).The increase will take effect in January for nearly 71 million Social Security recipients, while about 7.5 million people receiving Supplemental Security Income will see higher payments starting December 31.The announcement, which was scheduled for last week, was delayed due to the US federal government shutdown.Recipients saw a 2.5% increase in 2025 and a 3.2% rise in 2024, following a historic 8.7% jump in 2023 driven by record-high inflation. The COLA is funded by payroll taxes collected from workers and employers, up to an annual salary cap that will rise to $184,500 in 2026 from $176,100 in 2025.Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said in a statement that the annual adjustment “is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today’s economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security.” However, many seniors believe the increase won’t be enough to meet rising living costs, reported AP.Polling from AARP shows that many older Americans share that concern. Only 22% of Americans over 50 believe a COLA of around 3% is enough to keep up with inflation, while 77% disagree. According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a single adult living in Florence, South Carolina, spends about $10,184 annually on housing, $3,053 on medical expenses and $3,839 on food.Emerson Sprick, director of retirement and labor policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said in a statement that cost-of-living increases “can’t solve all the financial challenges households face or all the shortcomings of the program.”The latest adjustment comes as the Social Security Administration faces internal challenges and uncertainty about the program’s long-term future. In July, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the Republican administration was committed to protecting Social Security, hours after comments suggesting that a new children’s savings program signed by President Donald Trump was “a back door for privatising Social Security,” as quoted by AP.","Social Security benefits will increase by 2.8% in 2026, giving retirees an average monthly boost of more than $56.

Trump Tariffs, Inflation & U.S Economy: Ex-US Trade Official Issues Stark Warning I Mark Linscott

Gas prices surge, rent growth slows





Impact of tariffs on consumer prices









US inflation remained elevated in September, fueled by a surge in gas prices, even as rent growth slowed, reflecting a mixed picture for consumers in an economy with steady growth but sluggish hiring.According to the labor department report, cited by AP, consumer prices rose 3% from a year earlier—the highest increase since January and up from 2.9% in August. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, also climbed 3%, down from 3.1% the previous month.On a monthly basis, price gains eased, with overall consumer prices rising 0.3% in September, compared with 0.4% in August, and core inflation slowing to 0.2% from 0.3%.The report, delayed by the government shutdown that began October 1, leaves uncertainty over October’s inflation data, which may not be released.Gas prices surged 4.1% in September, a major driver of inflation, while grocery prices rose 0.3%, less than in August, and are up 2.7% from a year ago.Rent for apartments increased just 0.2% in September and 3.4% over the year, the smallest annual rise in nearly four years.“Put simply, while inflation doesn’t appear to be accelerating, neither is it moving back toward target,” said Eric Winograd, chief US economist at AllianceBernstein. “That will keep the Fed cautious rather than aggressive,” he added.Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump also pushed up the prices of furniture, appliances, clothing, and shoes. Economists estimate that tariffs are adding about 0.4 percentage points to annual inflation and expect the trend to continue into early next year.Ongoing tariffs continue to affect companies in specific industries. The Trump administration is considering steep duties on imports from Nicaragua, impacting businesses such as French Broad, a chocolate maker.“We’ve been shouldering some significant additional costs,” said co-founder Dan Rattigan, noting higher prices for cocoa, nuts, and chocolate-making equipment, as quoted by AP.The cost of necessities is a growing political issue. Beef prices reached record highs partly due to tariffs and drought-related reductions in cattle herds. Ground beef jumped to $6.32 a pound, and beef costs rose 1.2% in September and 14.7% over the year.Although inflation has fallen sharply from its peak of 9.1% over three years ago, it remains a major concern for consumers. About half of Americans say grocery costs are a “major” source of stress, according to an August AP-NORC poll.","US inflation remained elevated in September, fueled by a surge in gas prices, even as rent growth slowed.

‘If You Cancel…’: Trump ‘Warns Xi Against No Show At Summit; Says US Built China’s Military





The United States on Friday launched an investigation into China’s adherence to the ‘Phase One trade’ deal signed in 2020.Under the deal, China had pledged to increase purchases of US products and services by hundreds of billions of dollars over 2020 and 2021. However, the targets were not met, largely due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The probe was prompted by what the US Trade Representative’s office called China’s “apparent failure to comply with the January 15, 2020” agreement. Washington could take further action depending on the findings. This comes days before US President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping The move “underscores the Trump administration’s resolve to hold China to its Phase One Agreement commitments,” said US trade representative Jamieson Greer, as quoted by AFP.The investigation could heighten tensions between the two economies, which have already experienced a turbulent trade relationship during Trump’s second presidency. Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed sweeping duties on US trading partners, and Washington and Beijing have engaged in tit-for-tat retaliation. At one point, tariffs on both sides reached triple digits, disrupting supply chains.While tensions have eased somewhat, the trade truce remains fragile.Among the commitments, China had promised to boost purchases of US agricultural goods. But renewed tensions this year led Beijing to raise tariffs on US agricultural products, including soybeans, affecting a key support base for Trump.Chinese buyers also halted new soybean orders from the US autumn harvest, hitting the sector hard.On Friday, Greer emphasised the US commitment to protecting domestic interests. “Five years following entry into force, China's lack of compliance with the Phase One Agreement appears to have undermined the conditions of competition for US companies seeking to trade with and operate in China,” said the USTR’s office.The USTR is expected to seek public comments as part of the next steps in the investigation, which could shape Washington’s response to China’s trade practices.","U.S. launches investigation into China's adherence to 'Phase One trade' deal signed in 2020.

can it force Putin to end Ukraine war?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-sanctions-vladimir-putins-oil-empire-rosneft-and-lukoil-russia-ukraine-war-indias-import-of-russian-oil/articleshow/124787521.cms,"AI image for representaion only

TL;DR: Driving the news

On October 22, the US treasury department sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil—Russia’s two largest oil companies—and 34 of their subsidiaries.

The move marked the first major economic strike by the Trump administration against Moscow during his second term, and it targets what one senior US official called “the ATM of the Russian war machine.”

The sanctions target more than 34 subsidiaries and aim to freeze Russia’s main cash pipeline fueling its war in Ukraine.

The sanctions didn’t just freeze assets or bar US firms from doing business. In a critical twist, the US warned that any bank, anywhere, facilitating purchases of oil from these firms could be cut off from America’s financial system. That secondary threat had immediate global impact.

The announcement sent global oil prices soaring by 5% and sent shockwaves through markets in China and India, the two largest buyers of Russian crude.

Chinese state-owned refiners suspended purchases. Indian refiners, including Reliance Industries, began adjusting or slashing imports.

“We waited a long time,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get.”

Still, the central question remains: will this actually move Putin?

'Don't Poke The Bear': Putin FIRES At Trump's Sanctions, EU Toilet Ban; Shoots Russian Oil Warning

Why it matters

Trump’s sanctions strike at the very heart of the Kremlin’s wartime economy. Together, Rosneft and Lukoil produce 5 million barrels of oil a day, half of Russia’s total output, and account for over 2 million barrels in exports.

produce 5 million barrels of oil a day, half of Russia’s total output, and account for over 2 million barrels in exports. “It’s the most material move to date by the United States to shutter the Russian war ATM,” Helima Croft, of RBC Capital Markets, told CNN.

The US Treasury said the new sanctions are designed “to degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.”

And while Russia has often found creative ways around sanctions, the pressure is mounting. According to Reuters, several Chinese and Indian refiners paused purchases of Russian oil within hours of the announcement.

The big picture

“Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump said.

What they’re saying

Putin, appearing unmoved, called the sanctions “an unfriendly act” and insisted they would not inflict “significant” damage to Russia’s economy.

“No self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever make decisions under pressure,” Putin told reporters in Moscow.

Trump responded later that day with a smirk:

“I’m glad he feels that way. That’s good. I’ll let you know in six months.”

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the move but urged more.

“Sanctions are very important,” Zelenskyy said during a tense lunch with Trump. “But they are not yet enough.”

Meanwhile, Indian energy giant Reliance Industries said it would “adjust purchases” in light of the sanctions. India imports up to 2 million barrels a day from Russia-over 40% of Russia’s seaborne exports.

Still, as the Economist and CNN note, many Indian and Chinese refiners use third-party intermediaries to avoid direct exposure to US enforcement. That gives them cover-unless Trump decides to enforce secondary sanctions.

“Getting Putin to commit to serious concessions will take a lot more than sanctions,” Kurt Volker, Trump’s former Ukraine envoy, told WSJ. “Sending long-range missiles would be an important next step.”

Zoom in

Global oil prices are down 25% since January, giving him room to maneuver without triggering a domestic backlash.

New sanctions by the UK and EU-including bans on Russian LNG imports-have created a rare moment of alignment.

The Kremlin’s energy revenues have already dropped 21% this year due to drone strikes on refineries and falling global demand.

Still, enforcement remains the wild card. As CNN noted, Russia has built an “off-grid infrastructure” of shadow tankers, cutouts, and obscure banks to keep oil flowing.

Between the lines

Trump’s strategy seems torn between pressure and persuasion.

He still wants a deal. He hasn’t ruled out another meeting with Putin. But the shift in tone is unmistakable-from “art of the deal” to “enough is enough.”

A senior administration official told WSJ: “It was the culmination of good calls [with Putin] and then reading the papers and seeing Russia is still bombing schools.”

Despite Trump’s reputation for chaos, European leaders have cautiously welcomed the sanctions. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte made a surprise visit to the White House just before the announcement, urging continued US support for Ukraine.

Even Trump’s usual Republican skeptics fell in line:

Sen Marco Rubio, once a critic, said, “This was overdue.”

Sen John Thune called for a sanctions bill “to back the president’s efforts to bring the bloodshed to an end.”

What’s next

1. India cuts deeper – PM Modi may demand concessions in return.

2. China stays cautious – Beijing opposes unilateral sanctions but paused some purchases.

3. Trump enforces penalties – Will he go after buyers and shippers who defy the rules?

The bottom line





In the span of a week, US President Donald Trump went from planning a summit with President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to placing the harshest sanctions yet on Russia’s economy. The about-face was not just sudden-it was personal.The escalation follows months of Trump’s failed efforts to charm, cajole, and pressure Putin into negotiations.He offered incentives: a future summit, the prospect of post-war economic deals, and long talks with Putin. But according to WSJ, Trump’s patience snapped after yet another Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian kindergarten just days before the summit was to be held.As per the WSJ, the White House had long prepared three sanction packages-mild, moderate, and severe. Trump ultimately chose the “middle” option: hammer the oil industry but stop short of full economic warfare.Insiders say the final decision came after an Oval Office meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.“Do you guys agree with me?” Trump asked before signing off.Trump’s move represents a break from his previous reluctance to touch Russia’s oil exports-something even the Biden administration avoided to keep gas prices stable.But Trump’s calculus has changed:“The lasting impact depends on the US appetite to tackle those workarounds,” Richard Bronze of Energy Aspects told CNN.So far, the ruble has held steady, and Russian oil has not disappeared from world markets. But the friction is growing, and the logistical costs for Moscow are rising.Sanctions alone won’t bring peace. But they signal the end of the summit era and the start of a harder phase in Trump’s Ukraine strategy.If Russia’s oil exports start to fall significantly, pressure on the Kremlin will mount. But that outcome depends largely on whether:Experts agree the effect will be limited unless secondary sanctions follow.“Russia has set up a total off-grid infrastructure to be able to keep on supplying its oil to its trading partners, especially in India, especially in China,” Ajay Parmar, director of ICIS, told CNN.On the battlefield, the US has still withheld long-range missiles. But Trump hinted he’s reconsidering. If Russia escalates in response, he may reach for that option too.Trump is trying to turn economic pain into political leverage. The question is whether Putin blinks-or doubles down.This could be the start of a tougher era in US-Russia relations-or just another pivot in Trump’s unpredictable diplomacy.As Janis Kluge of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs told CNN: “Yes, it could be different tomorrow again. But it’s a signal that the mode of dealing with Russia-always giving another chance-has ended.”(With inputs from agencies)","The US treasury department sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil and 34 of their subsidiaries.

Target Corporation plans to lay off about 1800 corporate employees in its first major cutback in almost ten years. This change aims to improve stagnant sales and make its operations more efficient.Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke announced this decision in a memo to employees on Thursday.It comes at a time when Target’s share price has lagged behind rivals and the company has faced criticism for scaling back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to Reuters.“Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life,” Fiddelke, who will take over as CEO in February 2026, said in the memo. “It’s a necessary step in building the future of Target.”The cuts will impact about 8% of the corporate workforce.

'Don’t Close the Door': IMF Chief Kristalina Georgieva’s BIG Message to India on Trade Barriers





The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday urged Asian countries to lower non-tariff barriers and boost regional trade integration. The organisation said that this would help them reduce vulnerability to US tariffs and global economic shocks.Trade has been a major driver of Asia’s economic growth, with China serving as the global hub for manufacturing and supply chains.This reliance makes the region vulnerable to disruptions from US-China trade tensions and tariffs, the IMF said in its regional economic outlook report for Asia.Rising trade friction with the US and a boom in artificial intelligence investment have led to an increase in trade within Asia. The IMF said that removing trade barriers and promoting regional integration could help countries diversify export markets, lower costs and offset some of the negative effects of tariff shocks, as reported by Reuters.“If Asia integrates more within the region, that itself provides a buffer against external shocks,” said Krishna Srinivasan, director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department.Asia is already highly integrated in intermediate goods trade, with about 60% of total exports made within the region.By contrast, only 30% of final goods exports are sold within Asia, highlighting the region’s reliance on US and European markets, Srinivasan added.The report suggested that Asia could benefit from broader trade agreements, similar to those in the European Union, rather than relying mainly on bilateral deals, which often create overlapping rules and inconsistent standards.Non-tariff barriers, which increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and remain widespread, are particularly costly. Some countries are voluntarily reducing these barriers as part of trade talks with the US, a trend Srinivasan called “very positive.”The IMF said that greater regional trade integration could boost Asia’s GDP by up to 1.4% over the medium term and Asean economies by up to 4%.""There is a silver lining in that some countries, which had to liberalise anyway, are now liberalising,"" Srinivasan noted.The IMF projects that Asia’s economy will grow 4.5% in 2025, slightly lower than last year’s 4.6% but higher than its April estimate by 0.6 percentage point, supported by strong exports, partly due to companies shipping goods ahead of higher US tariffs.Growth is expected to slow to 4.1% in 2026 due to trade tensions, weak demand in China and soft private consumption in emerging economies.""While trade policy uncertainty has declined somewhat compared to April, it remains high and could weigh on investment and sentiment more than expected,” the IMF said.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday urged Asian countries to lower non-tariff barriers and boost regional trade integration.

The Donald Trump-led administration is preparing to defend its new H-1B visa policy in court after multiple lawsuits were filed against the $100,000 fee imposed on new visa applicants.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday (local time) said the administration would fight the legal challenges, arguing that the H-1B system has been misused for years and that the new policy aims to protect American workers.""The administration will fight these lawsuits in court. The president's main priority has always been to put American workers first and to strengthen our visa system. For far too long, the H-1B visa system has been spammed with fraud, and that's driven down American wages. So the president wants to refine this system, which is part of the reason he implemented these new policies. These actions are lawful, they are necessary, and we'll continue to fight this battle in court,"" Leavitt told reporters at the White House briefing.Her comments came after the US Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the administration’s decision, calling the $100,000 visa fee unlawful.Several other groups, including unions, employers, and religious organisations, have also filed lawsuits in federal courts in California and Washington, DC, arguing that the new fee violates immigration law and harms US industries.The Chamber’s petition says the new rule overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires visa fees to reflect the actual cost of processing applications.""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which Congress created expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the US,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and Chief Policy Officer at the US Chamber of Commerce.Bradley added that while President Trump’s overall economic policies have encouraged investment, the new visa fee could make it harder for businesses to find the workers they need.""President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unravelling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,"" he said.A coalition of unions, educators, and religious groups has also filed another major lawsuit against the visa fee, calling it ""arbitrary and capricious.""The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. The increased fee is expected to heavily impact the technology sector, particularly Indian IT professionals, who make up the largest group of H-1B recipients.The new $100,000 annual fee is a steep jump from the current H-1B processing costs, which are typically a few thousand dollars. Companies will pay this in addition to existing vetting charges, and the administration is still deciding whether to collect the full amount upfront or annually.The US Chamber of Commerce has warned that the high fee could force companies to reduce or abandon their use of the H-1B program altogether. Tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are among those likely to be affected.","Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the $100,000 fee imposed on new H-1B visa applicants.

Trump Melts Down Over CZ Pardon; Binance Boss Decreed ‘Not Guilty’





US President Donald Trump on Thursday pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty of enabling money laundering while leading the cryptocurrency exchange.“President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.“In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,” she added, as quoted by CNBC News.The pardon caps a monthslong effort by Zhao, a billionaire commonly known as CZ in the crypto world and one of the biggest names in the industry. He and Binance have been key supporters of some of the Trump family's crypto enterprises.Zhao expressed his gratitude on social media Thursday, saying, “Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice.”Zhao had pleaded guilty in November 2023 in Seattle federal court and agreed to step down as Binance CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement by the company with the Department of Justice.He was charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to “implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating US economic sanctions ‘in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the US market without implementing controls required by US law,’” the DOJ said.Binance had also been charged with conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Powers Act, and conspiracy.Zhao was sentenced in April 2024 to just four months in jail, although federal prosecutors had requested a three-year sentence.“The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career. These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States’ reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden Administration’s war on crypto is over,” said Leavitt.The pardon comes two months after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family’s own crypto venture, which has generated about $4.5 billion since the 2024 election, was aided by “a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform quietly administered by Binance.”","US President Donald Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.

How OnlyFans beat Nvidia and Apple to become the world’s most revenue-efficient company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-onlyfans-beat-nvidia-and-apple-to-become-the-worlds-most-revenue-efficient-company/articleshow/124766188.cms,"What OnlyFans does and how it works



Revenue efficiency and financial performance

User and creator expansion

The business model behind the numbers



Market leadership and ownership gains





OnlyFans has officially outpaced global tech titans to claim the title of the world’s most revenue-efficient company, according to data from financial and marketing analytics firm Barchart. The UK-based content subscription platform, best known for enabling creators from fitness trainers and musicians to adult performers to monetise exclusive content directly from fans, generates an astonishing $37.6 million in revenue per employee. Operating with a lean workforce of just 42 employees, OnlyFans has surpassed giants like Nvidia ($3.6 million) and Apple ($2.4 million) by a massive margin. In fiscal year 2024, the company reported $1.41 billion in net revenue from a $7.22 billion transaction volume, cementing its dominance in the creator-driven digital economy.OnlyFans operates as a subscription-based content platform where creators earn directly from their fan base. Fans pay a monthly fee to access exclusive material, which can include fitness tutorials, cooking demonstrations, lifestyle vlogs, music previews, or adult-oriented photos and videos, depending on the creator’s niche.The platform also allows direct interaction between creators and subscribers through private messages, pay-per-view posts, live streams, and personalised content requests.This level of communication gives subscribers a sense of exclusivity and connection, making OnlyFans more personal than most social media platforms.Unlike traditional media or entertainment companies, OnlyFans does not produce any content itself. Instead, it serves as an intermediary, providing the infrastructure, payment systems, and compliance framework that enable creators to monetise their work safely and directly. The company earns a 20 percent commission from creator earnings, while creators retain 80 percent, keeping both sides financially motivated.With over 4.6 million creators and 377 million registered users, OnlyFans has built one of the most profitable ecosystems in the global creator economy, blending community, creativity, and commerce.However, critics argue that the platform’s success is closely tied to its adult content market, which accounts for much of its traffic and revenue. This association has led to ongoing debates about content moderation, exploitation risks, and regulatory oversight. While the company positions itself as a hub for all types of creators, its reputation as an adult content platform has made it difficult to attract mainstream advertisers and diversify beyond that niche. Some analysts also warn that its reliance on independent creators makes it vulnerable to changes in user habits, government regulations, or payment processor restrictions.According to Barchart’s report, OnlyFans ranks far ahead of the world’s largest technology companies in revenue per employee, a measure of how effectively a company turns its workforce into profit. Its reliance on user-generated content and minimal operational overhead has resulted in exceptional financial efficiency.For the fiscal year ending November 2024, OnlyFans recorded $7.22 billion in gross payments from fans to creators, retaining $1.41 billion in revenue after payouts. That marks an 8 percent increase year-on-year, while pre-tax profit rose 4 percent to $684 million, and net profit after tax reached $520 million. Despite slower growth compared to its triple-digit expansion in 2021, OnlyFans continues to post consistent, debt-free profits, a rare achievement in the tech industry.While revenue growth has stabilised, engagement on the platform continues to rise. Creator accounts grew by 13 percent to 4.63 million, and fan accounts rose by 24 percent to 377.5 million during the 2024 fiscal year. This steady expansion demonstrates OnlyFans’ ability to maintain relevance in a highly competitive digital landscape.Creators collectively earned about $5.8 billion in 2024, while OnlyFans kept its 20 percent share, reinforcing a business model that rewards creators while ensuring strong platform profitability. The mutual benefit between platform and user has been central to OnlyFans’ sustained success.OnlyFans’ strength lies in its asset-light, platform-first model. By outsourcing content production to independent creators, the company avoids the costs of creative teams, studios, and large-scale product development. Instead, its small team focuses on technology, moderation, data security, and payment compliance, ensuring operational efficiency.Experts note that while high revenue per employee does not necessarily guarantee higher profit margins, it highlights the scalability and adaptability of the creator economy. OnlyFans has demonstrated how digital platforms can build immense value by facilitating, rather than producing, content.OnlyFans’ financial dominance is also reflected in its shareholder payouts. In 2024, the company distributed $701 million in dividends to its owner, Ukrainian-American entrepreneur Leonid Radvinsky, underscoring its strong cash flow and investor confidence.Despite growing competition from newer creator platforms, OnlyFans remains the global leader in subscription-based content, outperforming legacy tech companies in both financial efficiency and user engagement. Its rise marks a turning point in modern business, where digital autonomy, user participation, and scalable systems can outperform even the world’s biggest corporations.","OnlyFans generates an astonishing $37.6 million in revenue per employee.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

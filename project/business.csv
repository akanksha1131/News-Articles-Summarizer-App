About Swiggy

Swiggy IPO : Food delivery and quick commerce platform Swiggy’s IPO worth Rs 11,324 crore opens today. It consists of Rs 4,500 crore fresh issue and remaining as an offer for sale.

The fresh issue funds will support debt repayment, dark store expansion, technological improvements, marketing, and acquisition strategies.Investors can participate in the IPO until November 8. The company has established a price range of Rs 371-390 per share, with a minimum lot size of 38 shares and additional investments in multiples thereof.The company's shares currently show a Grey Market Premium (GMP) of Rs 12 in unofficial trading, suggesting a modest 3% premium above the issue price.The Swiggy IPO implies a market capitalization of Rs 87,299 crore, valuing Swiggy at 7.7 times FY24 annualized revenues, compared to Zomato's 17 times multiple.While Zomato achieved profitability in FY24 after three years of listing, Swiggy remains unprofitable and faces competition in quick commerce, according to an ET analysis. Despite these challenges, India's quick commerce potential makes this IPO attractive for long-term investors, though business execution risks persist, the analysis says.Market analysts have diverse opinions regarding the Swiggy IPO, considering the company's present financial condition, market competition, and valuation metrics. However, the food delivery sector's growth potential makes it a considerable option for long-term investors.""As of the fiscal year 2024, Swiggy continues to operate at a loss, in contrast to its competitor, Zomato, which has recently achieved profitability. We advise investors to Avoid this IPO until the company's financial performance and growth outlook improve. Waiting until Swiggy demonstrates improved financial results and a clearer path to sustainable growth would be a more prudent investment approach,"" said Samco Securities.""Swiggy, at an upper price band of Rs 390.0, is valued at Price/Sales, EV/Sales and P/BV multiple of 7.8x/7.3x/7.1x respectively of its FY24 financials on post issue capital.

We recommend investors to subscribe to the issue for a long term investment perspective,"" said SBI Securities.The Bengaluru company, established in 2014 for food delivery, expanded to quick commerce in 2020. Its unified application offers multiple services: food delivery, Instamart for groceries, Dineout for restaurant bookings, SteppinOut for events, and Genie for pickup services.

What will Donald Trump as US President mean for Indian stock markets? Top advantages & disadvantages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-will-donald-trump-as-us-president-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-top-advantages-disadvantages/articleshow/115005808.cms,"India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

BENGALURU: India made significant strides in patent filings, encouraging more inventors to pursue their innovations. Patent applications recorded a fourth consecutive year of growth, reaching a record high of 3.5 million, with the residents of China, South Korea, the US, Japan, and India being the main drivers of growth, according to the World Intellectual Property Indicators (WIPI) 2024 report.Patent applications worldwide showed consistent growth over the past four years, following a 3% downturn during the peak of the pandemic. China led the 2023 expansion with an additional 57,830 patent applications compared to 2022, followed by South Korea with 15,628 more submissions. The US contributed 12,682 extra applications, while Japan and India added 9,040 and 8,734 applications respectively.India recorded a remarkable growth rate of 15.7%, marking its fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. According to WIPI data, domestic patent applications contributed 55.2% of all patent submissions to India’s IP office. Over the past decade, India’s IP office has witnessed the most substantial shift in the proportion of resident versus non-resident applications.The share of domestic patent filings has risen dramatically to 55.2% in 2023 from 24.8% in 2013, the report showed. Last year marked a significant milestone as Indian residents submitted the most number of patent applications to the country’s IP office for the first time.WIPI’s data showed China demonstrated notable progress in its resident patent-to-GDP ratio , which grew to 4,875 last year from 4,030 in 2013. India also experienced substantial advancement, with its ratio climbing from 144 to 381 during the same period. Both nations’ resident patent filings increased more rapidly than their GDP growth over this time.However, the three nations known for their high patent-to-GDP ratios — Germany, Japan, and the US — have showed a steady decline in these figures over the last ten years.A majority of 13 of the top 20 offices received a greater number of patent applications in 2023 than in 2022. Among the biggest increases were recorded in India, which grew 17.2%, Vietnam, which was up 8.6%, and Indonesia and France, which rose 5.9% and 5.6% respectively.

"Despite GST hike, e-gaming companies revenue up 12% in FY24",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/despite-gst-hike-e-gaming-companies-revenue-up-12-in-fy24/articleshow/115192229.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Contrary to the concerns raised by online gaming companies when GST rates were raised by govt, the industry’s revenue grew by 12% to $3.8 billion in FY24, even surpassing what was earned by social media companies.According to a report released by gaming VC Lumikai, the growing trend of in-app purchasing (IAP) by players, as well as a packed sports schedule that boosted fantasy gaming, led to the industry registering growth despite initial fears from companies that numbers would decline with the decision to impose a 28% GST on the full-face value of player deposits.“In-app purchase revenue continues to be the fastest-growing segment with 41% year-on-year growth. With sustained growth in in-app purchases and ad revenue, the gaming market is expected to cross $9.2 billion by FY29, growing at a 20% five-year CAGR,” Salone Sehgal, founding general partner at Lumikai, told TOI.Sehgal said that online gaming continues to witness growing adoption by users, and even the time spent has increased. “The average weekly time spent on games increased by 30% in FY24, going up to 13 hours against 10 hours previously. The market saw the onboarding of 23 million new gamers as the total user base swelled to 590 million.” Cheap data rates and growth in affordable smartphones — the main medium for players to access gaming — have fuelled the industry’s growth not only in metros and bigger cities but also in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns and rural areas.At 15.2 billion, India is the world’s second-largest market for mobile gaming downloads, 3.5 times larger than the US and Brazil, Lumikai said. Over 60% of the smartphone user base of 883 million had games downloaded on their devices, and of this, 148 million are paying users, as per the FY24 report.The changes in tax rates saw the margins of companies come under pressure as real-money gaming (RMG) companies absorbed the GST cost of users, Sehgal said. “Despite growth in topline revenue, taxation challenges in RMG resulted in margin compression and an adverse impact on profitability.” Giving insights into the user base, the Lumikai report said 44% of gamers are women, many of them playing casual games. “As many as 66% of gamers come from non-metro cities.” The report said that gamers on average spend 13 hours per week, more than double what is spent on social platforms. “Around half of the gaming users are ad-tolerant,” Lumikai said.","The industry’s revenue grew by 12% to $3.8 billion in FY24, even surpassing what was earned by social media companies.

MUMBAI: Investors poured a record amount of money into mutual funds through systematic investment plans in Oct, largely ignoring a sliding stock market. Last month’s gross SIP inflow in fund houses stood at Rs 25,323 crore — the first break above the 25K mark ever — data released by Amfi showed. The total number of SIP folios also crossed the 10-crore mark during the month, the industry trade body said on Monday.Equity funds recorded net inflows for a record-extending 44 consecutive months, starting March 2021. However, due to the stock market’s slide in Oct, the total assets managed by the fund category dipped by about Rs 1.2 lakh crore to Rs 29.9 lakh crore, from Rs 31.1 lakh crore in Sept.Debt funds, on the other hand, witnessed a net inflow of nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore. This category got a major boost from a Rs 83,863-crore net inflow in liquid funds. Strong inflows through the debt funds route also helped the total assets managed by the MF industry to soar to a record Rs 67.25 lakh crore, Amfi data showed.The continued surge in SIP accounts, now exceeding 10 crore, along with a record monthly SIP contribution of Rs 25,323 crore, demonstrates the growing preference for disciplined investing among Indian investors, said Venkat Chalasani, chief executive, Amfi. “These milestones reinforce our commitment to making mutual funds the cornerstone of wealth creation for every Indian investor, as we continue to build a more financially inclusive nation.”During Oct, among the equity category, sectoral & thematic funds saw the biggest net inflows at Rs 6,862 crore. With total assets worth nearly Rs 4.5 lakh crore, thematic funds are now the largest among the equity category funds, Anand Vardarajan, chief business officer at Tata MF, pointed out. In terms of net inflows, the thematic funds category was followed by a Rs 4,336-crore net inflow through small-cap funds and another Rs 4,263-crore through mid-cap funds.“The healthy net flows are a testimonial to the resilience amongst domestic investors to continue investing in equities despite market volatility,” said Akhil Chaturvedi, executive director & chief business officer at Motilal Oswal MF.With the passive category, gold ETFs saw a Rs 1,961-crore net inflow last month, up sharply from the Rs 1,233 crore in Sept. “Global uncertainty, geopolitical tension, global inflationary pressure and uncertainties around interest rate have reinforced gold’s status as a safe haven,” said Himanshu Srivastava of Morningstar Investment Research India.","Last month’s gross SIP inflow in fund houses stood at Rs 25,323 crore.

GST Council call on insurance next month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-council-call-on-insurance-next-month/articleshow/115191933.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: The GST Council , which is set to meet in Rajasthan on Dec 21-22, will decide on slashing the levy on term insurance plans from 18% to zero, along with creating a similar dispensation for health covers for senior citizens as well as those purchasing insurance up to Rs 5 lakh.A decision on rate rationalisation for other goods and services is, however, unlikely in the meeting in the desert as states are yet to firm up their proposal amid concerns of revenue loss among several of them, especially Kerala and West Bengal, which are otherwise critical of the “high levies”.Most of the non-NDA governed states have opposed a reduction in the number of slabs from four to three. Currently, goods and services are taxed at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% with the top two accounting for three-fourths of the revenue.In fact, concerns over revenue loss have also come in the way of an across-the-board reduction in GST on health insurance as it generates around Rs 2,500 crore revenue and states are wary of losing any money now as the Centre is no longer there to compensate them. A group of ministers headed by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary has already firmed up the proposal on health insurance, the least contentious of the three issues on the table. A third ministerial panel led by minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary is looking at the future of compensation cess but a decision on that will be taken only towards the end of 2025 since the levy on luxury and sin goods is applicable until March 2026.When it comes to rate rationalization, the plan discussed was to focus on reduction in mass consumption items while increasing the levy on “luxury products” such as high-end shoes.","The GST Council is set to meet in Rajasthan on Dec 21-22. It will decide on slashing the levy on term insurance plans from 18% to zero. A decision on rate rationalisation for other goods and services is, however, unlikely.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115191959,imgsize-32524,width-400,resizemode-4/115191959.jpg"

Rupee falls to new low

of 84.39 vs $

MUMBAI: RBI, in consultation with govt and Sebi, has introduced a framework whereby foreign portfolio investment (FPI) can be reclassified as foreign direct investment (FDI) once it crosses the threshold of 10% holding in a company. RBI has said that this aims to improve the ‘ ease of doing business ’ for foreign investors.“This initiative will offer greater flexibility to FPIs to transit to a more strategic and enduring engagement with Indian companies. It also underscores govt’s commitment to fostering a conducive environment for foreign investment,” Sunil Kumar, tax partner at EY India, said. The move comes at a time when FPIs have been major sellers in the Indian market, with sales of Rs 94,000 crore in Oct 2024 alone.The new regulations, while providing a framework, don’t do away with existing limits under law. “This reclassification is subject to adherence to FDI norms , including sectoral caps , seeking Indian investee company’s concurrence and the necessity of obtaining govt approval, where applicable,” Kumar said.The new circular primarily outlines the process for an FPI to convert their investment into FDI when it exceeds the 10% ownership threshold. The earlier circular covered aspects such as modes of payment for different types of investments, the reporting requirements and the regulations related to specific types of investments.FPIs are considered investments in financial assets and offer a simpler registration process with Sebi.The rupee fell to a new low against the dollar on Monday, as anxieties surrounding the recent US election results and persistent foreign capital flight from Indian equities exerted downward pressure on the currency. Opening at 84.37, the rupee further weakened to breach the 84.39 mark, surpassing its previous record low of 84.38. Dealers said that sustained intervention by RBI is ensuring that decline in the value of the currency is calibrated.","RBI has introduced a framework whereby foreign portfolio investment (FPI) can be reclassified as foreign direct investment (FDI) once it crosses the threshold of 10% holding in a company.

MUMBAI: State-owned telecom company MTNL has defaulted on its Rs 1,000-crore loan to Bank of India, compelling the lender to make a Rs 200-crore provision in its financials for the second quarter of FY25.Earlier, SBI had declared loans to MTNL as sub-standard, requiring a provision.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government. PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest. He also noted the time when India had been ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’ economies in the world. Modi said that his governments have progressively helped India move from a state of vulnerability to a place of strength.PM Modi also said that in a world where most economies are struggling with low growth and high inflation, India stands out as an economy which is seeing high economic growth and low inflation. He also said that India's fiscal prudence has become an example for the world to see.Modi spoke of the government's initiatives to transform the manufacturing sector of the economy with steps like 'Make in India', Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, liberalisation of FDI norms, setting up of multi-modal logistics hubs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first Union Budget of the newly elected NDA government on July 23, 2024.","PM Narendra Modi said that in 10 years, his government has tripled India’s Budget.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

Stretched rally

Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally took the digital asset past $89,000 and lifted the overall value of the crypto market above its pandemic-era peak as traders bet on a boom under US President-elect Donald Trump The largest token has jumped about 32% since the US election on November 5 and hit an all-time high of $89,599 early on Tuesday. The original cryptocurrency changed hands at $89,165 as of 9:25 am in Singapore.Trump has vowed friendlier crypto rules and his Republican Party is tightening its grip on Congress to push through his agenda. Other pledges include setting up a strategic US Bitcoin stockpile and boosting domestic mining of the token.His stance is a sharp break from a crackdown on the divisive industry by the Securities & Exchange Commission under President Joe Biden ’s administration. The shift has energized speculative buying of large and small tokens alike, raising the value of digital assets to about $3.1 trillion, CoinGecko data show.Bitcoin is in “beast mode,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, wrote in a note. “The question for traders not already set is whether there is still room to chase this red-hot play or wait for a slight retracement and for some of the heat to come out of the impulsive trend.”In the options market, investors are lining up bets that Bitcoin will pass $100,000 as soon as the end of the year, according to data from the Deribit exchange. Meanwhile, software firm MicroStrategy Inc. — the largest publicly-traded corporate holder of Bitcoin outside the exchange-traded fund sector — bought about 27,200 Bitcoin for some $2 billion between October 31 and November 10.Traders for now are paying little heed to questions such as how quickly Trump will implement his agenda or whether a strategic stockpile is a realistic step.Bitcoin has more than doubled so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US ETFs and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the token exceeds the returns from investments such as global stocks and gold.Fairlead Strategies LLC technical analyst Katie Stockton in her latest research note said “it would be natural to see a period of digestion after such a steep run-up,” recommending a “short-term neutral bias.”Digital-asset companies spent heavily during the US election campaign to boost candidates viewed as favorable to their interests. Against that backdrop, Trump did an about-face, becoming a supporter of an industry he once labeled a scam.His backing turned Bitcoin into one of a range of so-called Trump trades. Others include US stocks and the dollar, both of which have also been advancing given Trump’s focus on domestic economic growth, tax cuts and protectionist tariffs.","The largest token has jumped about 32% since the US election on November 5.

Rising beyond the $160 level and gaining 13% over the past month, Solana (SOL) has shown fortitude. Due to its scalability and cheap transaction costs, Solana's total value locked (TVL) of $5.4 billion places it as a key competitor in the crypto industry, despite complaints regarding its centralising tendency. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance's presale, which sold over 114 million tokens in the past two months and drawn many investors with its creative strategy, has created a buzz. This has left crypto aficionados wondering: Can Solana reach $500, and what is the secret behind the presale numbers of Rexas Finance?With a weekly gain of 2.4%, Solana (SOL) has been creating waves; its price now exceeds the $160 barrier level to $165.97. Sol is under observation by traders and analysts since breaking above $160 could indicate continuous positive momentum. By the end of this month, some analysts estimate SOL might be worth $180. Technically, Solana's performance is reinforced by various indicators. Strong buying interest would be shown if SOL could cross its annual VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and the crucial support level of $154. With estimates of over 100 million Solana wallets, the network's activity also recently underwent a spike. But since many of these wallets are empty, questions have surfaced over possible bot activity raising the network's measurements.Projections of SOL reaching $500 are highly pessimistic. Reaching this level requires SOL to overcome a sequence of important resistance levels, which could take a while. Solana's development has been noteworthy, especially with its rise from $22 to $120 over a year ago, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain the momentum needed to attain such high valuations in the distant future.While Solana draws interest, crypto billionaires and investors are also looking at Rexas Finance, a venture with record-breaking presale levels.Rising as a major competitor in the crypto space, Rexas Finance presents significant short-term profits when compared to more established initiatives like Solana. With Stage 4 alone bringing over $5.4 million and an amazing 130% return for early supporters in just two months, the presale for the project has attracted great interest. This expansion has attracted attention to Rexas Finance's creative strategy, presenting a special chance for investors. At its present price of $0.07, investors demonstrate great interest in the token, so the current presale stage 5 is presently 74% complete. With 114,732,875 tokens sold out of a targeted 155,000,000 and a total of $5,781,319 raised thus far out of a projected $8.6 million. This increase in demand demonstrates general belief in the project's ability to challenge established markets with a fresh vision for blockchain uses.Other elements driving the presale performance of Rexas Finance have been found by crypto experts. Recently, the site started a millionaire giveaway with a $1 million prize pool worth of RXS tokens. Twenty fortunate winners will get RXS tokens valued $50,000 apiece. Users must interact with the community to raise their chances of winning and enter their ERC20 wallet address on the Rexas Finance website (rexas.com). Particularly considering plans to offer the RXS token on three top-tier exchanges at a listing price of $0.20 in the first quarter of 2025, Rexas Finance has a bright future. For Stage 5 investors, this action promises a possible 186% increase; early supporters might see gains of more than 330%. Analysts estimate that considering the demand for the RXS token, it might rally up to 12000% by the end of 2025, therefore confirming its revolutionary nature in the crypto industry.Solana shows resiliency, but Rexas Finance makes a strong argument for those looking for quick gains. Rexas Finance seems poised to generate significant gains that could exceed even Solana's remarkable increase with its consistent presale performance, creative platform, and strategic listing policies.","Solana (SOL) has been creating waves; its price now exceeds the $160 barrier level to $165.97.

Crypto Is Macro Now

Bitcoin is closing in on $80,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers.The cryptocurrency climbed as much as 4.3% to an unprecedented $79,771 on Sunday and remained near $79,000 as of 2:05 p.m. in Singapore. Smaller tokens like Cardano and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also rallied.Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets. He emerged from Tuesday’s election in a stronger position than expected — his Republican Party has control of the Senate and is on the verge of holding a narrow majority in the House.“With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros.Bitcoin has added about 90% so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold.The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc.’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A day earlier, the iShares ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak — all signs of how Trump’s victory is reshaping crypto.Trump’s stance contrasts with a crackdown on digital assets under President Joe Biden. Securities & Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler repeatedly labeled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency turned the screws on crypto following a 2022 market rout and a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange.Digital-asset companies and executives spent heavily during the US election campaign to promote candidates viewed as favorable toward their interests.“Trump has promised supportive regulation, and the sweep of the House and the Senate makes the passage of crypto bills much more likely,” wrote Noelle Acheson, author of thenewsletter.","Bitcoin is closing in on $80,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets.

US stocks climb as Fed cuts interest rates by 0.25% to curb inflation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-climb-as-fed-cuts-interest-rates-by-0-25-to-curb-inflation/articleshow/115073308.cms,"The US stock market on Thursday continued its upward trend following the Federal Reserve's announcement to lower the interest rates by 0.25 per cent.This move by the Fed came as a response to the once high inflation that resulted in Trump winning the Presidential elections, dropping down towards the bank’s target of 2 per cent. The rate cut brought a wave of relief in the American economy as the policymakers took note of a job market that has ""generally eased"".However, the Fed's announcement had little impact on the market, as the cut, even with its exact magnitude, was widely anticipated by the investors.The market was almost certain of the central bank’s decision to cut in November. Investors are closely monitoring the central bank's next statements to gain insight into the future direction of interest rates.The S&P 500 rose 44.06 points to 5,973.10 or 0.7 per cent up, continuing its high from Tuesday after Donald Trump's presidential victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained mostly flat, with a minute dip of 0.59 to 43,729.34, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 285.99 to 19,269.46 or 1.5 per cent.The central bank started lowering rates in September, when the Federal Reserve announced a 0.50 per cent rate cut and signaled that further reductions were likely.The market’s direction even after the Fed cuts still remains uncertain as the result of Trump’s win, who is advocating for tariffs and other policies that could drive inflation higher as per economists.Investors have already begun speculations about the Fed rate cuts for the next year. Even though lower rates can boost the economy, they may also fuel inflation.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that for now, nothing is changing. “In the near term, the election will have no effects” on interest-rate policy, he said.Powell said that the Fed considers all the possible policy changes with any president and their effect on the economy and only then the officials decide on how the interest rates should be shaped.He also noted that the policy changes to be implemented if Trump returns to the White House remain uncertain.“We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,” he said.On Wall Street, healthcare services firm McKesson boosted the market with a 10.6 per cent rise after reporting a quarterly profit that exceeded analysts' expectations.Mobility service company Lyft surged 22.8 per cent after surpassing Wall Street's sales and profit expectations, while Ralph Lauren gained 6.6 per cent as strong demand from customers in Asia and Europe helped the company deliver better-than-expected profits.However, financial services firm JPMorgan Chase dropped 4.3 per cent, along with Goldman Sachs, which also contributed to the Dow Jones Industrial Average's slight decline.Smaller US stocks also emerged as market losses, with the Russell 2000 index down 0.4 per cent which previously had twice the gain expected by S&P 500.The stock that’s become most synonymous with the president-elect, Trump Media & Technology Group, fell 23 per centt.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury lowered to 4.33 per cent from 4.44 per cent late Wednesday,opposing the surge it gained on the previous day.The rise had been driven by expectations that Trump's plans for higher tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation could boost economic growth, increase US government debt, and lead to higher inflation.","The S&P 500 rose 44.06 points to 5,973.10 or 0.7 per cent up.

Fed's Powell: Will not quit even if asked by Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-says-he-will-not-quit-even-if-asked-by-trump/articleshow/115068042.cms,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear he’s ready to defend the US central bank from political pressure following the re-election of Donald Trump , saying he wouldn’t resign if asked and insisting the incoming president doesn’t have the power to fire him or other senior Fed leaders.“No,” Powell said firmly on Thursday, when asked whether he would step aside if Trump asked for his resignation.During a press conference following the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, Powell said repeatedly that Trump — who explored firing the Fed chief during his first term in the White House — lacks the legal authority to demote or remove the chair or other senior Fed officials in Washington.“What Powell is saying, in making the forceful statement that no one can be demoted, is that the Fed’s leadership is all in this together,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a professor and Fed historian at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “I see this as Powell’s declaration that the president-elect is going to have his say on shaping the Federal Reserve, but not until there are vacancies to be filled.”Powell’s remarks were striking as he worked hard to dodge every other politically-charged question lobbed at him from reporters. He strictly avoided speculating on what policies might emerge from the incoming administration. But he readily weighed in when the matter involved protecting the institution he’s served since 2012.“He’s a firm believer in the importance of Fed independence, and quitting voluntarily due to criticism from a president would show that the Fed isn’t independent,” Ian Katz, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, wrote in a note to clients.The comments, just two days after Trump’s re-election, portend the power struggle that may lie ahead between the central bank and a president who insists he should have a say on interest-rate policy.Trump, who won Tuesday’s election by an unexpectedly large margin, has often blasted Powell. Though Trump appointed him to the chair in 2018, he then quickly pivoted to publicly urging him to stop raising rates later in the year.Staunch InstitutionalistPowell, a staunch institutionalist reared among Washington’s elite, has often spoken about the importance of central bank independence. In an interview earlier this year, he cast his desire to serve out his full term as a part of that.Trump, for his part, has backed away from some of his more provocative statements about how much a president should influence the central bank. He told Bloomberg in June that he’d let Powell serve out his current term, which ends in 2026. But he’s also said a president should be allowed to at least make suggestions on policy.One potential target for the Trump administration is Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, the Fed’s top banking regulator who Republicans have repeatedly criticized.Speaking later Thursday on Bloomberg Television, Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, a leading contender to join Trump’s cabinet, said “everything should be on the table” when it comes to considering Barr’s position.“I would look at any legal option that we might have to make a change there,” he said.Ultimately, any attempt at firing or demoting Powell or his colleagues would probably face a battle in the courts. Many legal scholars have maintained that the president likely doesn’t have the authority to fire the central bank chair, but there could be a legal pathway for demoting the vice chair for supervision, some say.Rate CutThe Fed, meantime, delivered a quarter-point interest-rate cut on Thursday — the second-straight reduction. While the Fed is expected to lower rates further in the coming months, investors and economists have pared back expectations for how low rates will fall this cutting cycle, partly in response to Trump’s election.Trump has promised to deploy more aggressive tariffs, crack down on immigration and extend tax cuts — policies that could put upward pressure on prices and long-term interest rates.Powell reiterated that future policy decisions will depend on incoming economic data, and the Fed won’t try to anticipate fiscal or trade policy.“We don’t know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be,” Powell said. “We therefore don’t know what the effects on the economy would be, specifically whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.”The Fed chair committed to additional rate cuts in the future but not a timeline, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Stifel Financial Corp. He left “the door open for a potential policy pause at that December meeting should the data remain as solid as it has and should inflation remain as sticky as it has.”Powell noted the economy has been stronger than expected, and also pointed to a higher-than-hoped September inflation reading.Though he insisted all options remain on the table, the comments opened the possibility the Fed might take a pause from lowering rates at its December gathering — the final meeting of the year.“We’ll make a decision as we get to December,” Powell said, adding that policymakers will get more data before then.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says he won't resign if asked.

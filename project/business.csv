Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, Camlin Fine Sciences and Equinox India Developments are the top stock picks for today. Here’s their view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for February 7, 2025:The Nifty traded in a range with corrective bias in the last two sessions after 1000 points up move in previous seven sessions highlighting consolidation ahead of the RBI Monetary policy outcome.Going ahead, we expect index to trade with a positive bias while sustaining above the support area of 23,400-23,200 and gradually head towards 24,000-24,200 levels in the coming weeks which is the 38.2% retracement of the previous fall (26277-22786) and upper band of the falling channel containing entire decline of the last four months.Key support is placed at 23,200-23,400 levels being the confluence of the last week low, last Tuesday gap up area and past three weeks breakout area. Stock specific action will continue to remain in focus as we sail through the fag end of the Q3FY25 earnings seasons.Volatility is anticipated to remain elevated due to fluctuating global cues, the RBI monetary policy outcome, and the results of the upcoming Delhi elections.On the market breadth front, the percentage of stocks above the 50-day SMA within the Nifty 500 universe has increased from a bearish extreme of 9% last week to 23%. Additionally, the weekly stochastic oscillator has bounced back from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal, further supporting the positive bias.Bank Nifty in the last two sessions consolidated in a range after rallying 2500 points in the preceding 9 sessions. The index in the process closed above the last three weeks range indicating revival in the upward momentum.We believe 48,900-49,200 to act as immediate support and any dip witnessed hereon should be capitalized as a buying opportunity in quality stock in a staggered manner. We expect the index to head towards 51,200-51,500 levels in the coming sessions being the measuring implication of the last three weeks range breakout and the 50% retracement of the previous decline (53,888-47,844).Volatility is likely to remain elevated on account of RBI monetary policy outcome on Friday. Key support is seen at 48,900-49,200 being the confluence of current week low and 61.8% retracement of the recent up move.The stock is seen breaking above the last five weeks range (140-120) as it is seen rebounding after a base above the 200 days EMA thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily RSI is in uptrend thus supports the positive bias. The stock is expected to head higher towards 157 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the last five weeks range breakout (140-120).The share price of Equinox India Developments is at the cusp of breakout above the falling supply line joining the highs of CY21 and CY24 thus offers entry opportunityThe stock has formed a good base around the 50 day EMA and is forming higher highs and higher lows in the weekly chart. We expect the stock to head higher towards 169 levels in the coming months being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous breather (164-106)","The Nifty traded in a range with corrective bias in the last two sessions.

Although numerous amendments were implemented to adapt to evolving circumstances, the current tax framework requires modernisation.The present digital era has revolutionised tax administration, with electronic filing becoming standard practice.

Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh.

For example, for a person having income of Rs 12,10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax, works out to be Rs. 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakhs + 10% of Rs 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10 thousand). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs.

NEW DELHI: Retail inflation eased to a five-month low in January as vegetable prices moderated, bringing much-needed relief to authorities battling stubborn price pressures, while industrial output growth slowed, led by a sluggish manufacturing sector.Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Wednesday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 4.3% in Jan, slower than the 5.2% in Dec and below the 5.1% recorded in Jan last year. Rural inflation was higher at 4.6% and urban at 3.9%. The food price index slowed to 6% in Jan from 8.4% in Dec. The NSO said that there is a decline of 91 basis points in inflation in Jan, compared to Dec last year, and it is the lowest year-on-year inflation after Aug 2024.A sharp decline of 237 basis points is seen in food inflation in Jan, compared to Dec last year, and it is the lowest after Aug last year.

Vegetable inflation has been a significant contributor to overall CPI inflation in recent months, averaging 27% since Jan 2024.

""IIP growth eased sharper than we had forecast to 3.2% in Dec 2024, led by manufacturing, even as the expansion in electricity and mining output recorded a sequential uptick.

D-Street Smart: Volatility drives investors from

thematic schemes

to

hybrid funds

MUMBAI: Retail investors continued to pour money into mutual funds in Jan despite a volatile stock market. Monthly gross SIP inflows remained steady above Rs 26,000 crore in Jan, industry body Amfi's data showed. The volatile market conditions, however, prompted investors to prefer hybrid funds over thematic schemes, industry players said.During Jan, the MF industry took in Rs 26,400 crore through the SIP route, marginally lower than Rs 26,459 crore in Dec. SIP accounts too dipped to 10.26 crore from 10.32 crore in Dec. Consequently, there was a dip in total assets under management through the SIP route: From Rs 13.6 lakh crore in Dec to Rs 13.2 lakh crore.According to Amfi chief Venkat Chalasani, the drop in number of SIP accounts and the related AUM are due to a reconciliation process that was carried out by RTAs and the exchanges following a regulatory directive.Data for Jan showed that net inflows through debt schemes was at nearly Rs 1.3 lakh crore and through the equity schemes at Rs 39,688 crore. Within the equity segment, although thematic schemes net took in Rs 9,017 crore, highest for the segment, it was substantially lower than Rs 15,332 crore in Dec. In contrast, hybrid funds took in a net Rs 8,768 crore, up from Rs 4,370 crore in Dec. ""There is a swing in allocations from thematic funds to asset allocations funds like balanced advantage funds and multi asset allocation funds including large cap funds as a pure equity exposure,"" said Akhil Chaturvedi, ED & chief business officer, Motilal Oswal MF.The data also showed that the fund industry's total AUM in Jan rose to Rs 67.3 lakh crore from Rs 66.9 lakh crore, despite a Rs 1.9 lakh crore net inflow. This rise in AUM of smaller magnitude is attributed to the mark to market losses due to the slide in stock prices in Jan, industry players said.","Volatile market conditions prompted investors to prefer hybrid funds over thematic schemes.

Why are Israeli companies looking at India now?

Which are the sectors they are interested in?

What has been the response of Indian companies?

How are you convincing Indian businesses about the security situation in the region?

Israel has a huge requirement of manpower for reconstruction. Are you looking at sourcing manpower from India?

Nir Barkat , Israel's minister for economy and industry, was in India, leading a large business delegation. In an interview to TOI, Barkat, a businessman turned politician, says he is optimistic about deepening business ties with India across sectors. Excerpts.The opportunities have emerged now with the American President Donald Trump, and Israel and India can align interest and seek together how to scale up global business. We in Israel provide a lot of technology and India is a great partner in complementing, scaling and tailoring solutions to big problems. We view India not just as a local market but as a hub for regional and international expansion and we see the huge growth that India has for future and we are hedging on India.There's a lot of classic high-tech - business to business, business to consumer, health and life sciences . Israel excels in this. We have 2,000 companies in health life sciences, which is second in absolute number to the US. There's a lot of interest in health and life sciences. We have agro tech, food tech, aqua tech - making food from the sea. We have lots of advanced industries to increase productivity of businesses. We have desert tech and climate change since 60% of our country is desert and we have homeland security, especially after this war to combat terror. We have mastered how to do it in an effective way and this is relevant for all countries that are friendly with Israel like India.When I was here in Dec, I was invited by minister Piyush Goyal. We brought the biggest ever business delegation that ever left Israel. Indian companies collaborated with each other and exchanged knowledge. Minister Goyal will organise a mission from India coming to Israel. It's a fundamentally different approach and then we will know how to better pursue doing more business together.On the contrary, I think it is the best time to do business because usually after a round of violence in a region, there's a huge spike in business because there's innovation. I was a combat officer in the first Lebanese war or the Intifada. You go back to war, you have time to think and you create more ideas that are very relevant not just for security, but for everything. You will see a huge amount of innovation in Israel seeking global interest. Because, we are so tiny, we are less than 10 million people. Our businesses seek international partners from the start. A lot of it is focussed on the US. Now, we are sharing that knowledge with Israeli entrepreneurs and telling them to look at India. The India of tomorrow is not like the India of yesterday. It's a big giant moving ahead and we want to collaborate. We have no other alternative but to succeed and win in Israel because we are the only Jewish state. We have nowhere else to go. It is certainly safe. It's an opportunity that I think Minister Goyal sees as much as I do. We see through those challenges and the opportunity is waiting for us to take it.Not enough. We need more. We want both skilled and unskilled workers. I proposed to my govt to dramatically increase the number of people we bring to work in Israel. We have to work out the details and I have another meeting with the relevant minister today and we want more workers. Israelis love Indians. We love to see Indian employees in Israel. We need a lot of outsourcing too, which can be done to India.","Nir Barkat, Israel's minister for economy and industry, was in India, leading a large business delegation.

With the state govt issuing a circular on January 30 to grant terminally ill patients the right to die with dignity , Karibasamma now eagerly awaits the formalities to make her wish a reality.Karibasamma's journey has been one of unwavering determination. She battled a slipped disc for more than three decades and was recently diagnosed with cancer.Despite her deteriorating health, she spent the last 24 years fighting for the right to die with dignity in India, shooting off letters to the chief minister, Prime Minister, President, and even to the Supreme Court.Though the apex court had legalised passive euthanasia in 2018, it is only now that Karnataka has decided to implement the right to die with dignity, with this key clarification from the state health and family welfare minister, Dinesh Gundu Rao, that the decision is not to be confused with euthanasia and ""is applicable only to those who are on life-support and non-responding to life-sustaining treatment"".""Many are on the list, waiting to avail this right, but I wish to be the first [in Karnataka],"" Karibasamma said.Currently residing at an old-age home in Davanagere with her husband, Karibasamma's fight for this right has come at a great personal cost. She lost her property, finances, and relationships in its pursuit, but never wavered in her belief that those suffering from terminal illnesses deserve a dignified death .Opting to live in a care-home for the last 20 years, Karibasamma has also distanced herself from all material wealth, donating her last remaining savings of Rs 6 lakh to the welfare of Border Security Force (BSF) personnel.Childless Karibasamma said her fight for the right to die with dignity alienated her from her relatives.""The number of elderly people suffering from terminal illnesses in the country is large. Like me, they are suffering without the opportunity to die with dignity. When I started the fight, seeking implementation of this law, everyone was shocked.

Poll Do you agree with the Chhattisgarh HC ruling on marital consent? Yes, legal stance is correct No, consent is essential

NEW DELHI: The Chhattisgarh high court has ruled that sexual intercourse, including unnatural acts, by a man with his adult wife, even without her consent, cannot be considered an offence.The judgement was delivered by Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas, who acquitted a resident of Jagdalpur previously convicted of rape and other charges.The man had been arrested in 2017 and later convicted by a trial court in Bastar district under IPC sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural sex), and 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) following his wife's death.The high court had reserved its verdict on 19 November last year and pronounced it on Monday (10 February).""If the age of wife is not below age of 15 years then any sexual intercourse or sexual act by the husband with his wife cannot be termed as rape as such absence of consent of wife for unnatural act loses its importance,"" the judge noted.According to the prosecution, the man, a resident of Jagdalpur, Bastar district, was arrested on 11 December 2017, following his wife's statement to an executive magistrate before she passed away the same day in a government hospital.The woman had complained of pain and informed her family that her husband had allegedly engaged in unnatural sex against her will. Her dying declaration, recorded before the magistrate, stated that she became ill due to ""forceful sexual intercourse"" by her husband.On 11 February 2019, the Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court) in Jagdalpur convicted the man under sections 377, 376, and 304 IPC and sentenced him to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. He later challenged the verdict in the High Court at Bilaspur.During the appeal hearings, the defence argued that there was no legally admissible evidence against the accused and that his conviction was solely based on the victim's statement. The counsel further contended that the trial court had overlooked statements from two witnesses who testified that the woman had suffered from piles since her first childbirth, which caused bleeding and abdominal pain. He also questioned the reliability of the dying declaration.The state government, however, defended the trial court's judgement and sought the appeal's dismissal.The court, in its ruling, stated: ""From perusal of sections 375, 376 and 377 of IPC it is quite vivid that in view of amended definition of Section 375 IPC, offence under Section 377 IPC between husband and wife has no place and, as such rape cannot be made out.""It further noted that the 2013 amendment to Section 375 IPC introduced Exception 2, which clarifies that sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his wife do not constitute rape. Therefore, if a husband engages in unnatural sex with his adult wife, it cannot be considered an offence under Section 377.The court observed that Section 377 (unnatural sex) does not explicitly define the offender, although body parts involved in carnal intercourse are well defined and overlap with Section 375. It also cited the Supreme Court’s five-judge bench ruling in the Navtej Singh Johar case, which decriminalised consensual unnatural sex, and stated that an offence under Section 377 IPC is not applicable in cases of consensual acts.""In the light of amended definition of Section 375 and the relationship for which exception provided for not taking consent - i.e. between husband and wife - and not making offence of section 376, it is quite vivid the definition of rape as provided under Section 375 for which consent is not required then unnatural sex cannot be made as unnatural offence between husband and wife,"" the court observed.As per Section 375 IPC, the accused is defined as a 'man', while the victim is classified as a 'woman'. In this case, since the accused is the 'husband' and the victim is his 'wife', and given the overlap in body parts defined for carnal intercourse, the court ruled that no offence could be made out under Section 375 IPC due to the amendment.""Thus, it is quite vivid, that if the age of wife is not below age of 15 years then any sexual intercourse or sexual act by the husband with his wife cannot be termed as rape under the circumstances, as such absence of consent of wife for unnatural act loses its importance. Therefore, this court is of the considered opinion that the offence under Section 376 and 377 of the IPC against the appellant is not made out,"" the judgement stated.Regarding the conviction under Section 304 IPC, the High Court deemed it ""perverse"" and overturned it.""The learned trial court has not recorded any finding how the offence under Section 304 of the IPC is attracted to the present facts of the case and proved by the prosecution. Still, it has convicted the appellant under Section 304 IPC, which is nothing but perversity and patent illegality which deserves to be interfered with by this court,"" the court observed.The judge acquitted the man of all charges and ordered his immediate release from prison.","The Chhattisgarh high court ruled that sexual intercourse, including unnatural acts, by a man with his adult wife, even without her consent, cannot be considered an offence. The judgement was delivered by Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas, who acquitted a resident of Jagdalpur previously convicted of rape and other charges. The man had been arrested in 2017 and later convicted by a trial court in Bastar district following his wife's death.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118159816,imgsize-12960,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118159816.jpg"
India's Got Latent controversy: 'Cool abroad but not in Indian culture',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/indias-got-latent-controversy-cool-abroad-but-not-in-indian-culture/articleshow/118159735.cms,"KOLKATA: Reactions started pouring in from across Kolkata after YouTuber and podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia , known online as BeerBiceps, sparked controversy by directing an inappropriate question about parents to a participant on comedian Samay Raina's show "" India's Got Latent "".Actor Kharaj Mukhopadhyay said he would not like to be even in the audience of any show involving sexual jokes regarding parents. ""Jokes on various issues have been part of our culture. It is always important to understand the motive behind the joke. Is it being said in good humour or to insult?

Often, it doesn't particularly matter whether or not it is in good taste. I am not for moral policing since that is something that the czars would do in a non-democratic structure, but there have to be some boundaries we ourselves will have to establish,"" Mir said.Self-censorship and evaluation are essential, he emphasised. ""One must understand what can be expressed in a public space in India. One can go to a country like Georgia where the definition of freedom of speech is so elaborate that people don't care. I also must point out that people who are calling for Ranveer's head now peculiarly remain silent on far more crucial issues that plague our senses and sensitivities,"" Mir added.Many agree that Indians are still not used to the concept of roasting. According to stand-up comic Ankita Ghosh , who performed in the city on Friday, people ought to remember that ""India's Got Latent"" draws inspiration from the globally renowned show ""Kill Tony"", where comedians deliver minute-long performances whilst panel guests subsequently roast them. ""The prevailing atmosphere and demeanour are merely jovial repartee. The overall mood and tone is of lighthearted banter. Nothing said by anyone is taken seriously. We need to remember that while passing judgement about this incident!"" Ghosh said.Ghosh believes that anything is permissible in comedy provided it elicits genuine laughter. ""I've witnessed legends like Ricky Gervais deliver remarkably provocative jokes, but I harbour no objections as long as they induce mirth,"" she said. Irreverence in comedy is deemed to be cool abroad, said Mir. ""People like Hasan Minhaj have been doing that for years in New York. Years ago, Russell Peters started saying the same thing,"" Mir said.Ghosh asserts she shall not alter her script because of this incident.

US inflation picked up broadly at the start of the year, further undercutting chances of multiple Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year at the same time the Trump administration presses forward with tariffs. The monthly consumer price index rose in January by the most since August 2023, led by a range of household expenses like groceries and gas, as well as housing costs. Excluding often-volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core CPI climbed 0.4%, more than forecast, fueled by car insurance, airfares and a record monthly increase in the cost of prescription drugs.Inflation tends to come in higher in January, because many companies choose the start of the year to hike prices and fees. That pattern has been been exacerbated in the post-pandemic era, and several forecasters suggested that the jump in price growth last month won't be repeated going forward.Still, Wednesday's report serves as further evidence that inflation progress has at least stalled - if not in danger of being reversed. Combined with a solid labour market, it will likely keep the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future.","Consumer price index rose in January by the most since August 2023.

Fed in no hurry for rate cuts: Jerome Powell hints no change in US central bank's policy stance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-in-no-hurry-for-rate-cuts-jerome-powell-hints-no-change-in-us-central-banks-policy-stance/articleshow/118153596.cms,"Future of interest rate cuts remains uncertain

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US central bank will be keeping its interest rates unchanged for now, citing inflation levels which fall above Fed’s 2 per cent target and a solid job market.Speaking before the Senate Banking Committee on the first of a two-day testimony, Powell hinted that the central bank would maintain its current policy stance, having already cut rates by a full percentage point in late 2024.“With the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,” he said.His comments come at a time when the Trump administration is introducing sweeping policy changes, including tariffs on steel and aluminium and significant reductions in government spending.The Fed is also conducting a second review of its policy strategies and communication tools, though Powell insisted this would not include changing the bank’s inflation target , despite calls from some economists to raise it.After the Fed’s last review in 2019, it shifted to an average inflation target of 2 per cent, which analysts argue resulted in its slow response to rising prices in 2021 and 2022. The central bank only began raising rates in March 2022 to curb inflation by making borrowing more expensive.At its December meeting, the Fed projected two rate cuts in 2025, thought the market analysts are now less confident. Morgan Stanley revised their forecast to just one rate cut next year, while futures markets suggested a single cut in July.Fewer reductions would mean continued high borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and auto loans, though mortgage rates are also influenced by movements in US Treasury yields.Fed Governor Adriana Kugler had earlier said that the labour market was “stable,” allowing policymakers more time to assess their next move.She also acknowledged that Trump’s proposed economic policies, including tariffs and immigration restrictions, could result in new inflationary pressures. Some economists warn of mass deportations that could shrink the labour force and drive wages higher, fuelling inflation.Others argue that Trump’s deregulation agenda might boost supply and lower prices.“The cautious and the prudent step is to hold the (Fed's key) rate where it is for some time,” Kugler said.Strong job growth suggested less urgency for the Fed to cut rates, a stark contrast to last September, when weak hiring prompted a steep half-point rate reduction amid recession fears.“The latest data bolsters our confidence that the Fed cutting cycle is over,” economists at Bank of America wrote in a note on Friday.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US central bank will be keeping its interest rates unchanged.

Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.

Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Bitcoin dropped from around $105,000 on Saturday to about $92,000 on Sunday night. However, it later recovered to over $100,000 on Monday after Trump paused tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods.While bitcoin showed some recovery, other cryptocurrencies saw larger losses. Ethereum , dogecoin, and other digital assets declined sharply. Trump’s own meme coin traded at around $19 on Monday, about 75 per cent below its peak when he launched it before his second inauguration.“These are riskier cryptos than bitcoin,” Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency analyst was quoted as saying by news agency Associated. “But it’s a little surprising how big the gap is.”Financial markets also saw major shifts before the tariffs were set to take effect. Trump warned that Americans might feel “some pain” from the tariffs but said the move was necessary. He also suggested that tariffs on the European Union and possibly the United Kingdom could follow.Bitcoin was created in 2009 as digital cash outside government control. Over the years, it has become more mainstream, with its price movements now closely tied to tech stocks.Meme coins, a more volatile part of the crypto market, have also seen sharp declines. First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin, launched before Trump took office, is down nearly 90% from its highest value.Trump, who was once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now embraced digital assets. He has promised to make the US a leader in crypto and has appointed officials supportive of the industry.Despite recent declines, cryptocurrencies have gained value since Trump’s election.

But the conservative leader may also be seeking favor with Washington, where the Trump administration said Saturday it would impose its own 25% tariffs on Mexico.Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced Monday that the tariffs would be halted for now to give the two sides more time to negotiate. Trump has demanded that Mexico do more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling across the border.Noboa, who took time away from a re-election campaign to attend Trump's inauguration last month in Washington, has hailed Trump's win as a victory for Latin America.Ecuador's announcement comes amid the South American country's separate and bitter diplomatic dispute with Mexico, which last year severed diplomatic ties after Ecuadorian police broke into the Mexican Embassy to arrest Ecuador's former Vice President Jorge Glas.Ecuador's move was widely condemned as a breach of international law, while Ecuador said that Glas was wanted for fraud and not for political reasons and accused Mexico of illegitimately granting him political asylum at the diplomatic compound.Trade between the two countries is minimal, however, accounting for less than 1% of Mexico's total exports, according to Mexican central bank data.Noboa, heir to a banana fortune, is running Sunday in elections for his first complete constitutional term after being elected 18 months ago to finish the aborted mandate of ex-President Guillermo Lasso.","Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers.

The pound slipped 1 per cent against a stronger US dollar, trading just under $1.23, though it gained 0.4 per cent against the euro, which is also weighed down by the tariff war.Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, told The Mirror, financial markets are likely to react strongly to Trump’s tariff measures. She noted that while the FTSE 100 could be somewhat shielded due to its defensive nature and the absence of immediate UK-specific tariffs, the index still pointed to a 0.8 per cent decline at the start of the week.""This does not mean that the UK economy will avoid impact from the tariffs, but it does mean that the UK economy could be more resilient than elsewhere. It’s too early to know exactly what impact tariffs will have on the global economy, but it is fair to say that they have a high potential of triggering inflation, and weighing heavily on global growth, including the US economy,"" she said.","The blue-chip index fell 105.8 points to 8,568.2 during early trade on Monday.

Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ether witnessed steep declines on Monday as rising tariff war tensions weakened investor sentiments. During early trade in Asia, Bitcoin fell to $94,476.18, briefly hitting a three-week low of $91,441.89.Ether saw an even steeper drop of 24 per cent, hitting its lowest level since September, to $2,494.33.The downturn extended into Sunday, with bitcoin slipping 7 per cent to $93,768.66, according to Coin Metrics.

Much of this rally was driven by expectations that his administration would introduce crypto-friendly policies, with Trump himself vowing to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet.""However, despite early optimism, some investors have grown impatient over the lack of concrete regulatory reforms. Last month, Trump ordered the formation of a cryptocurrency working group to explore potential regulations and even consider a national crypto reserve, but rigid policy changes remain absent.Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the ongoing tariff war could ultimately benefit bitcoin in the long run. ""“A sustained tariff war will be amazing for bitcoin in the long run due to an eventual weakening of the dollar and US rates."" he told ET.Analysts are keeping a close eye on the $90,000 support level for bitcoin, warning that a drop below this threshold could trigger a slide towards $80,000.

US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.The greenback recorded a major gain while weighing down Euro to a two year low and injuring the conventional safe haven Swiss frank to its lowest since May.However, two biggest trading partners for the States’ Canada and Mexico, wasted no time in vowing retaliation measures. China also condemned the move, claiming it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization, news agency Reuters reported.Last month after assuming office, Trump had threatened to hit Canada and Mexico with a 25 per cent tariff and while China stood at a levy of 10 per cent, alleging to combat issues like illegal immigration and drug trade.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, gained 0.11 per cent to 109.65 after hitting a three-week high previously in the session.The tariff news also shifted expectations for Federal Reserve policy . Traders scaled back bets on interest rate cuts, pricing in just 41 basis points of easing this year—down from 47 basis points previously.The US dollar climbed 0.7 per cent to 7.2552 yuan in offshore trading, after briefly hitting a record 7.3765 yuan. With Chinese markets closed for Lunar New Year, traders expect further volatility when trading resumes on Wednesday.It jumped 2.7 per cent to 21.40 Mexican pesos, the highest since March 2022.The Canadian dollar weakened 1.4 per cent to C$1.4755 per US dollar, a level last seen in 2003.It plunged 2.3 per cent to $1.0125, a low last recorded in November 2022, before a minor reverse back to $1.0257.It fell 0.74 per cent reaching $1.2304.Though global markets were tumbling down, the Japanese yen held firm at 155.50 per dollar.US economic data released on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, closely observed by the Federal Reserve—rose 0.3 per cent in the past month, the largest increase since April 2024. This suggests the Fed may be in no rush to resume cutting interest rates.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies took a hit. Bitcoin slid 4.4 per cent to $97,622, falling back below $100,000 for the first time in nearly three weeks. Ether tumbled 15 per cent to $2,812.8, its lowest level since early November.Donald Trump is expected to discuss the tariffs with Canada and Mexico, arguing that Americans may feel economic ""pain"" from the 25 percent duties but that it will be ""worth the price.""He informed news agency AFP of ""speaking with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau tomorrow morning, and I'm also speaking with Mexico tomorrow morning.""""I don't expect anything very dramatic,"" he added.China, Mexico and Canada are the top three US trade partners and all have vowed to retaliate when the tariffs take effect Tuesday.","US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.

This came moments after the latter signed the executive order imposing steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, escalating tensions in an emerging trade war.""Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against Can$155 billion ($106 billion) worth of American goods,"" he saidHe urged the Canadians to prevent vacationing in US to fight back over the tariff imposition.Further, Trudeau announced that retaliatory duties on $30 billion worth of US alcohol and fruit will take effect Tuesday, coinciding with the implementation of US tariffs. He began his address with a direct message to American consumers.“It will have real consequences for you, the American people,” he said.“The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,” Trudeau said, warning that it could bring about “dark times"" for many.Trump declared an economic emergency to impose tariffs of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada. However, energy imports from Canada—including oil, natural gas, and electricity—would be subject to a reduced 10% tariff.""Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

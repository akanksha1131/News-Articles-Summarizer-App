Stock market recommendations:Nifty during last week on expected lines consolidated in the range of 23,000-23,800 after a 8.5% rally in the preceding 15 sessions. Index in the process worked off the overbought condition developed after the recent sharp rally.Key observation in the daily chart of Nifty is that it has already taken 7 sessions to retrace just 50% of its preceding 6 sessions up move (22,353-23,869). A shallow retracement signals overall positive price structure and a higher base formation above the 50 days EMA. Nifty during the current consolidation phase has absorbed the entire volatility related to US tariff highlighting strength. Hence, we believe the current breather should be used as a buying opportunity in quality stocks in a staggered manner.Going ahead, in the coming week we expect the index to resume up move after the recent breather and gradually head higher towards 23,869 (last week high) and then towards 24,200 levels in the coming weeks being the high of January 2025 and 50% retracement of the entire 5 months decline (26,277-21965)On the downside, 23,000-22,700 would act as strong support being the confluence of the recent breakout area and 50% and 61.8% retracement area of the recent up move from 21965-23869.The recent sharp decline of US 10-year yields below 4.2%, Dollar index below 104 and Brent crude staying below $ 75 is positive sign for India’s economy and Equity market.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, NHPC and Symphony are the top stock picks for today.

For Delhivery, the deal represents a strategic move to increase its scale and strengthen its competitive position in the fast-evolving logistics market.Sahil Barua, Managing Director and CEO of Delhivery, expressed confidence in the move, stating, “The Indian economy needs continuous improvements in logistics cost efficiency, speed, and reach. This acquisition will help us serve the customers of both companies better by making bold investments in infrastructure, technology, and our network.”Delhivery, with Rs 5,488 crore in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, is well-positioned to finance the acquisition. The deal is still subject to approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) but is expected to close in the next six months. After the acquisition, Ecom Express will operate as a subsidiary of Delhivery.The deal marks the end of Ecom Express's IPO ambitions. The company had previously filed a draft prospectus in August 2024, seeking to raise Rs 1,284.5 crore in fresh capital while also offering Rs 1,315.5 crore in secondary stake sales. However, the deteriorating market conditions led to the postponement of these plans.In the lead-up to the acquisition, Ecom Express had already begun consolidating its operations, shutting down several delivery hubs, and laying off hundreds of employees. Delhivery had also raised concerns about Ecom Express's financial practices, accusing its rival of inflating its operational metrics, particularly by double-counting return-to-origin shipments, which inflated the company’s reported volumes.Ecom Express has faced further challenges following the death of its cofounder, T. A. Krishnan, in October 2023. Krishnan, who helped establish the company in 2012 and played a vital role in shaping India’s e-commerce logistics landscape, had stepped back from day-to-day operations over a year before his passing.","Delhivery has announced its acquisition of Ecom Express in an all-cash deal valued at Rs 1,407 crore.

top $800bn in FY25

NEW DELHI: A last minute scramble by companies to beat Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs may have helped India come close to FY24 goods level export of $437 billion, senior officials said.Apple is said to have shipped five planeloads of iPhones and other products to the US over just three days to stock up its warehouses and ensure prices don't surge.In its edition on Saturday, TOI had reported that Apple had shipped an ""unusually high"" number of shipments from both India and China despite this being a lean season. The trend was seen in the case of other electronics products too. an official said.Also read: Stocked-up Apple buys time, may not pass on duties soon Gems and jewellery players also stepped up exports amid pressure from American buyers. Between April 1 and 4, gems and jewellery exports to the US through the precious cargo clearance system for customs in Mumbai soared nearly six-fold to $344 million, compared with $61 million in the same period last year. This was probably to beat the 10% tariffs that kicked in at midnight Saturday. Apparel shipments were similarly fast-tracked.India's goods and services exports are estimated to have topped $800 billion during the fiscal year ended March.India's goods exports had declined 3% in 2023-24 and cumulative exports had reached $778 billion. A few weeks ago, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had nudged exporters to step up the flow of consignments during the last fortnight of the last fiscal year. The prod came after a 11% decline in exports during Feb, which was estimated at $36.9 billion, compared with $41.1 billion in Feb 2024.""There was a significant increase in exports during the last week of March,"" confirmed Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council.

Usually, there is a surge in external trade in March. Due to the tariff threat, there was a lot of uncertainty among businesses, an industry source said.With stocks in their warehouses, companies are hoping to reduce some of the blow for consumers although exporters said it may affect the volume of goods shipped during the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Exporters are hoping that over the next few months, uncertainty will also ease, putting trade back on track.",Apple is said to have shipped five planeloads of iPhones and other products to the US over just three days.

""SMMT is in constant contact with government and will be looking for trade discussions to accelerate as we need to secure a way forward that supports jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.""In 2023, UK car production fell 13.9% to 779,584 vehicles, with more than 77% of those cars destined for export. To combat the impending tariff impact, UK carmakers, including JLR, have been stockpiling vehicles in the US ahead of the tariff increase. This proactive strategy led to a 38.5% increase in exports to the US in December, 12.4% in January, and 34.6% in February.David Bailey, a business economics professor at the University of Birmingham, noted, ""This was manufacturers like JLR trying to get ahead of the game in terms of getting inventory to the US before the tariffs were implemented.""Despite these efforts, the new tariffs on vehicles could significantly affect the UK car industry's export strategy. The US remains a vital destination for British-made vehicles, with car exports valued at £8.3 billion ($10.7 billion) over the 12 months through September, according to government statistics.

NEW DELHI: Govt is going to be patient and seek to protect its interests in the proposed trade deal with the US, amid suggestions from other countries to work on bilateral pacts to beat the impact of Trump's tariffs .""We will ensure the deal is balanced and a win-win for both sides. We already have an advantage over others because our talks with the US started earlier as there were indications reciprocal tariffs were going to be announced,"" a senior govt official said, adding India was not keen to rush with an agreement.The official indicated that govt intends to hold its ground in several of the sensitive sectors despite the US putting massive pressure on India to slash tariffs. ""Like us, they also have sensitivities in sectors like peanut butter,"" the source said.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick recently said agriculture cannot be off the table and India could look at quotas and limits. It is still early days in the trade talks with only the modalities having been discussed, and the USTR team that came to India will confirm terms of reference for the engagement.Following the announcement of tariffs earlier this week, India has been in touch with several countries but has limited capacity to negotiate trade agreements given that talks for seven are already under way, which includes those with the UK, the EU, Oman, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Bahrain and Qatar are also said to be keen to discuss an FTA, and the one with Gulf Cooperation Council, which also includes Saudi Arabia, have moved slowly for the last few years.While suggesting some of these countries are keen to speed up talks, the sources, however, ruled out partnering with the likes of Asean, with a part of the fear emanating from China's foothold in the region. The assessment in govt is that India is better placed as exporters may be able to absorb the higher burden compared with some Asian rivals which have been slapped with heftier levies.While there will be impact in sectors like marine products, with Ecuador gaining an edge, sources said exporters can explore newer markets such as EU, where govt had managed to get the rules eased in recent months.

India has emerged a ""winner"" in the recent US tariff hikes , as its exporters are better positioned to absorb the impact compared to competitor countries that are facing higher import duties in America, sources said on Saturday. They added that sectors that could get impacted like marine need to explore new markets such as the European Union to push their shipments.India has protected its dairy sector in all the free trade agreements and it will continue to do so and safeguard them, they said, adding that if the US goes ahead with imposing higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals also, it will have a small impact on India.""India has emerged as a winner in the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US. India has the first mover advantage as it is negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with America,"" one of the sources said.In a trade pact, two countries either significantly reduce or eliminate import duties on the maximum number of goods traded between them. So in this case, both nations could look at cutting taxes for each other.While the US has imposed an additional 26 per cent import duty on India, its competitor Vietnam is facing 46 per cent tariff, Bangladesh 37 per cent, China 34 per cent, Indonesia 32 per cent, and Thailand 36 per cent.On top of 34 per cent, imports from China to the US face previously announced 20 per cent tariffs. Now as China has retaliated to reciprocal tariffs, President Donald Trump is expected to increase duties further as he had announced.The commerce ministry is reaching out to domestic exporters regarding these tariffs. Work is progressing to prepare the export promotion mission for extending support measures to exporters.The US-China trade war will also prove huge opportunities to Indian exporters to increase their shipments.""The government is there to protect domestic industry from any possibility of dumping of goods in such a situation,"" they said.According to reports, US President Donald Trump has said tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors will be announced shortly, emphasising that the measures on pharmaceutical imports will be unprecedented.

Things are analysed carefully,"" the source said, adding that a slight impact on demand in the US could be a little challenging.About the demand slowdown in the US due to hike in tariffs, they said the slowdown is unlikely to be significant, as the US President has promised tax cuts, which will increase disposable income; energy costs are down and the ""delta"" between their import price and retail prices for most products remains high.One of the products where the tariff hit could be more is shrimps as the competitor country Ecuador is facing just 10 per cent duty.

The transaction which marks consolidation in the new-age logistics space comes amid mounting troubles for Ecom Express which stalled its public listing plans and laid off at least a few hundred employees earlier this year. “This is a distress sale for Ecom Express. The biggest challenge for them arose from the change in Meesho’sbusiness structure which moved to its in-house logistics service Valmo. Ecom Express got about 40%-50% of its business from Meesho. The market is such that it’s very difficult to replace even 10% of a company’s business,” said Satish Meena, advisor at market research firm Datum Intelligence.The acquisition, Delhivery said, will add to the company’s scale, strengthening its value proposition to clients. “Logistics is a scale-driven business where economies of scale lead to higher efficiencies, enabling players to provide higher quality services at more competitive prices,” the firm said.Post the acquisition which is expected to close in six months, most of the investors of Ecom Express will exit the firm. Warburg Pincus , British International Investment and Partners Group collectively hold over 80% shareholding in the company. Ecom Express which had filed for a Rs 2,600 crore IPO in August 2024 was last valued at about $878 million, data from market research firm Tracxn showed. Delhivery had last year accused Ecom Express of misrepresenting facts in its draft IPO papers.“The Indian economy requires continuous improvements in cost efficiency, speed and reach of logistics. We believe this acquisition will enable us to service customers of both companies better, through continued bold investments in infrastructure, technology, network and people. The founders and management of Ecom Express have established a high quality network and team, creating a strong foundation to integrate into Delhivery’s operations,” said Sahil Barua, MD & CEO at Delhivery in a statement.","Delhivery is acquiring rival Ecom Express in an all-cash deal for Rs 1,407 crore.

2) Global Markets Tumble Amid Recession Concerns

3) Indian Pharmaceutical Industry Faces Tariff Pressures

4) Heavyweight stocks drag indices

Stock market crash: Indian stock market indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, crashed on Friday amid global market turmoil triggered by growing recession concerns and new tariff declarations from US President Donald Trump. BSE Sensex and Nifty50 plunged over 1%. BSE Sensex closed the day at 75,364.69, down 931 points or 1.22%.

This widespread sell-off was influenced by weak performance in global markets and increasing concerns about global trade conflicts. Analysts noted that substantial selling of shares in major companies like Reliance Industries, Larsen & Toubro and Infosys, coupled with a significant decrease in global crude prices signalling recession concerns, contributed to the market downturn.The overall market value of BSE-listed companies decreased by Rs 9,98,379.46 crore, bringing the total market capitalisation to Rs 4,03,34,886.46 crore (USD 4.73 trillion), reflecting the negative sentiment in equity markets.Donald Trump intensified international trade tensions by implementing a universal 10% baseline tariff on U.S. imports.

Notable companies including Aurobindo Pharma, Laurus Labs, IPCA Laboratories, and Lupin saw declines of up to 7%.During his Air Force One press interaction, Trump announced: ""The pharma is going to be starting to come in at, I think, a level that you haven't really seen before,"" suggesting imminent trade actions.He elaborated on the targeted approach: ""We are looking at pharma as a separate category.

China issued a scathing rebuke to the United States over its tariff hike, accusing Washington of economic bullying and warning of serious consequences for the global trading system. The response came as a global stock markets tumbled, with China attributing the sharp declines to President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs.China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun posted a screenshot on Facebook showing the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all falling over 5% on Friday, adding the caption, “The market has spoken.” He called the trade war “unprovoked and unjustified” and urged the US to resolve trade disputes “through equal-footed consultation.”The S&P 500 dropped 6%, the Dow Jones fell 5.5%, and the Nasdaq plunged 5.8% — sharp sell-offs triggered by Trump’s aggressive tariff move, which China said has intensified an already escalating trade war.In response, China announced it will impose a 34% tariff on all US imports starting next week, joining a series of retaliatory actions. On Saturday night, Beijing escalated its criticism, issuing a strongly worded statement through the state-run Xinhua News Agency.“The US uses tariffs as a weapon to exert extreme pressure and seek private interests. This is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism, and economic bullying,” the statement read. It accused Washington of “seriously violating WTO rules” and “damaging the rules-based multilateral trading system.”The statement added, “We do not provoke trouble, but we are not afraid of trouble. Pressure and threats are not the right way to deal with China.” It vowed that Beijing would continue to take “firm measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests.”China also signalled it would not retreat from global engagement, pledging to pursue “high-level opening-up” despite mounting trade barriers. “Economic globalisation is the inevitable path for the development of human society,” it said. “The world needs justice, not tyranny.”","China issued a scathing rebuke to the United States over its tariff hike, accusing Washington of economic bullying.

Iran's currency hits record low amid escalating tensions with US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/irans-currency-hits-record-low-amid-escalating-tensions-with-us/articleshow/120018271.cms,"Iran Currency Rial (AP)

Impact of US sanctions and economic pressures

Internal unrest

Iran's call for dialogue with the US

Iran's rial reached an unprecedented low against the US dollar on April 5, 2025, trading at over 1 million rials for a single greenback. The dramatic depreciation of the currency follows the country’s return to work after the Persian New Year, Nowruz, when the exchange rate surged due to limited trading.As currency exchanges resumed in Tehran , the rial's value continued its freefall, reaching 1,043,000 rials to the dollar. Traders on Ferdowsi Street, a central hub for currency exchanges in Tehran, turned off their electronic signs in uncertainty, unsure of how much further the rial could decline, as reported news agency AP.""We turn it off since we are not sure about the successive changes of the rate,"" said Reza Sharifi, a trader at one of the exchanges.The weakening of the rial has been driven by years of economic pressure, particularly the fallout from international sanctions imposed after the US’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar. However, following the US's ""maximum pressure"" campaign under former President Donald Trump , which targeted Iran’s oil exports, the rial’s value has steadily eroded.Market analysts believe that the continued decline in oil sales and inflationary pressures, exacerbated by foreign sanctions, have contributed to the rial’s ongoing slide. ""Expectations for a decrease in oil sales and more inflation have caused a higher rate for hard currencies,"" said market analyst Mehdi Darabi.The economic collapse has fueled widespread frustration in Iran. With savings evaporating, many Iranians are holding onto hard currencies, gold, and tangible assets like cars, while others are turning to cryptocurrencies or participating in high-risk financial schemes. The political climate is similarly volatile, with protests continuing over the mandatory hijab law as many women in Tehran defy the law by not wearing the headscarf in public.Further economic unrest has been triggered by rumors of a potential rise in gasoline prices, which could spark nationwide protests as seen in the past. The falling rial is also putting more pressure on the Iranian government. In March, the country’s parliament impeached Finance Minister Abdolnasser Hemmati over the deteriorating value of the rial and accusations of economic mismanagement.Additionally, President Masoud Pezeshkian faced backlash after he dismissed his vice president, Shahram Dabiri, following public outrage over Dabiri's luxury Antarctic cruise, which some viewed as insensitive given the country's economic struggles.“In a situation where the economic pressures on people are huge, and the number of deprived people is massive, expensive recreational trips by officials—even if paid for with their own money—are not defensible,” Pezeshkian said in firing Dabiri. Dabiri has not provided a public explanation for the trip.Amid mounting internal and external pressures, President Pezeshkian has reiterated Iran’s desire for ""dialogue from an equal position"" with the United States. He criticized the US approach, saying, “If you want negotiations, what is the point of threatening? America today is not only humiliating Iran but the world, and this behavior contradicts the call for negotiations,” according to the state-run IRNA news agency.Despite ongoing tensions and economic turmoil, Iran remains open to dialogue, though direct talks with the US have yet to yield substantial progress.","Iran's rial reached an unprecedented low against the US dollar on April 5, 2025, trading at over 1 million rials for a single greenback.

He further warned that the resulting economic slowdown is expected to ""push the unemployment rate up to 5.3 [percent],"" according to The Hill.The concerns were echoed by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said the tariffs could deal a heavier blow to the economy than previously estimated. Speaking at a business journalism conference on Friday, Powell said, ""While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.""Under the new policy, a 10% tariff applies to all imports beginning April 5. From April 9, countries with the largest US trade deficits—India among them—will face higher, customised levies. India will see a 26% tariff on all its exports.Despite this sharp hike, brokerage firm Jefferies said the effect on India’s outbound trade may be limited. In a client note, the firm pointed out that major Indian export sectors—such as IT services, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles—are not directly hit by the tariff escalation.“The 27 per cent (now corrected in a document to 26 per cent) tariff on India is looking reasonable from a relative perspective. Bigger worries are on weaker US economic outlook, which is a -ve for IT services and other exporters,” Jefferies noted. While the firm played down direct tariff consequences, it cautioned that a broader US slowdown may weigh on demand for Indian exports, particularly in technology services.The global economic outlook now faces further pressure as businesses brace for the cascading effects of the escalating US trade war.","J P Morgan projects U.S. will slip into a recession by the end of 2025.

Trump’s tariff war triggers $5 trillion wipeout as US markets suffer worst week since 2020,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-war-triggers-5-trillion-wipeout-as-us-markets-suffer-worst-week-since-2020/articleshow/119994012.cms,"Donald Trump announced tariffs on exporters to the US, including 20% on the European Union and 24% on Japan.

Market meltdown, global fallout

The S&P 500 lost 6%, translating to a staggering $5 trillion in market capitalisation wiped in just two days.

Dow Jones dropped 2,231 points (5.5%) while the Nasdaq tumbled 5.8%, dragging it into bear market territory—over 20% below its record high.

Oil prices sank to their lowest since 2021; copper and other commodities also slumped on recession fears.

Just 14 companies out of 500 in the S&P 500 saw gains on Friday.

Trump unfazed: 'ONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL'

GE Healthcare, which earns 12% of revenue from China, fell 16%.

DuPont slid 12.7% amid an anti-trust probe by Chinese regulators.

Nintendo delayed preorders for the Switch 2 due to “evolving” trade conditions.

Automakers like Stellantis halted production at North American plants.

Fed Chair warns

A brutal week on Wall Street ended with $5 trillion wiped off the US stock market , as investors recoiled from President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff hikes. The S&P 500 plummeted 6%, marking its worst weekly performance since March 2020 when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the global economy. Fears of a looming global recession have now intensified as Trump reignited a full-blown trade war.Despite a stronger-than-expected jobs report, confidence was shattered after Trump slapped steep new import duties on dozens of countries, prompting swift retaliation—most notably from China. Investors hoping for relief from the Federal Reserve were left disappointed as Chair Jerome Powell took a cautious “wait and see” stance on rate cuts.China hit back with a 34% tariff on all US imports, effective April 10, matching Trump’s latest move. The response accelerated global market losses and sent shockwaves through trade-heavy industries.Major US trading partners such as Japan, the EU, and Canada began preparing countermeasures. Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs, the EU floated a digital tax on US tech firms, and Tokyo urged calm as it faced 24% tariffs on exports.From his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump remained defiant, calling the economic chaos a necessary “operation” to fix the trade imbalance. “ONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL!” he posted on Truth Social. He dismissed market declines as an opportunity: “This is a great time to get rich.”Trump’s tariffs also included a blanket 25% on all foreign-made cars, prompting swift reactions. Nissan reconsidered cuts to US production, while Volvo (owned by China’s Geely) pledged to ramp up manufacturing in America.Fed Chair Powell warned that tariffs could fuel “higher inflation and lower growth” and resisted calls to cut interest rates, citing the risk of unanchored inflation expectations. “Our obligation is to make certain that a one-time increase in price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” he said.Trump, in his usual combative style, pushed back: “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”The tariffs drew rare bipartisan criticism. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said Trump was “messing around with people’s lives… while he’s out golfing,” and even Republican Senator Ted Cruz warned the policy could “hurt jobs and hurt America.”","The S&P 500 lost 6%, translating to a staggering $5 trillion in market capitalisation wiped in just two days.

Elon Musk: What did Elon Musk's DOGE do to Deloitte? 124 contracts worth more than $370 million slashed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-did-elon-musks-doge-do-to-deloitte-124-contracts-worth-more-than-370-million-slashed/articleshow/119989581.cms,"What did Elon Musk's DOGE do to Deloitte? 127 contracts worth $1.16 billion slashed

Deloitte has been hit hardest by the Trump administration’s consulting cuts , with at least 124 of its federal contracts eliminated or modified since January, Fortune reported.The cuts, led by Elon Musk ’s department of government efficiency ( DOGE ), aim to reduce government spending and have resulted in an estimated $371.8 million in taxpayer savings .According to Fortune, DOGE has cut or modified at least 124 Deloitte contracts since the start of Trump’s second term. These contracts were worth a total of over $1.16 billion, with terminations done worth over $371.8 million. The largest cancelled contract, valued at $51 million, was for IT services for the department of health and human services. Deloitte has faced more contract eliminations than any other consultancy, with Booz Allen Hamilton and Accenture trailing behind.DOGE claims to have saved $140 billion overall, but Bank of America has raised concerns over exaggerated savings, as some listed contract terminations predate Trump’s tenure or ended naturally, reported The New York Times.The cuts have impacted the private sector, as federal contracts are a major source of revenue for consulting firms. Accenture’s CEO Julie Sweet acknowledged in an earnings call that the reductions have hurt the firm’s revenue, with its Federal Services division losing $240.2 million in contracts. Following her remarks, Accenture’s stock dropped by more than 7%.The General Services Administration (GSA) has asked consultancies to submit detailed reports identifying cost-cutting opportunities. “This Administration is firmly of the view that America’s private industry is our backbone… but that’s not inconsistent with right-sizing spending,” said GSA’s Josh Gruenbaum, according to Fortune.While DOGE’s actions have largely spared the defence sector, companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, which rely heavily on Pentagon contracts, remain at risk. Analysts warn that prolonged cuts could impact innovation and economic growth, with firms taking a cautious “wait-and-see” approach.","At least 124 Deloitte contracts have been cut or modified since January.

Trump tariffs: Apple may hold back price hikes for now with sufficient reserves in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariffs-apple-may-hold-back-price-hikes-for-now-with-sufficient-reserves-in-the-us/articleshow/119988758.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Apple does not intend to make any immediate changes to the retail prices of its products such as the flagship iPhone, including in India, following the Trump administration’s imposition of reciprocal tariffs as the company had sent “unusually high” number of shipments from factories in India and China to build up stocks in America despite this being a “relatively lean period”, top sources have told TOI.Apple’s warehouses in the US remain “sufficiently stocked up for the next few months” with products shipped from key manufacturing locations at a “frenetic pace” to beat the start of the higher tax regime, that begins with a baseline 10% tariff from April 5 and thereafter with the addition of respective reciprocal tariffs (different for each country) from April 9.“Factories in India and China and other key locations had been shipping products to the US in anticipation of the higher tariffs coming into play. The reserves that arrived at lower duty will temporarily insulate the company from the higher prices that it will need to pay for the new shipments that start coming under the revised tax rates,” one of the sources said.The US is one of the biggest markets for sales of iPhones and other products of Apple and there are fears that if the company passes off the entire duty burden on the customers, there will be a slowdown in consumer demand as well as significant reduction in the company’s margins.“Any price hike to offset this impact cannot be limited to just the US market, but will have to be taken across key global regions, including India. Such a step can only be taken once the company makes a full assessment of the supply chain and manufacturing locations, the stipulated tariffs for those countries, and how to balance the production from various regions to provide a cushion to shipments into the high-tax US market,” the source said.Trump’s tariff announcements may end up giving India a larger share in global smartphone production from Apple, though a confirmed word will be out only once America concludes its negotiations with various countries to fix the final rates.Apple, which nearly dominates India’s smartphone export shipments of roughly $9 billion to the US, will find expansion in India more attractive, considering that tariff on New Delhi currently stands at 26%, compared to the peak duty of 54% on China (it primarily makes iPhones in India and China).","Apple does not intend to make any immediate changes to the retail prices of its products such as the flagship iPhone, including in India.

Trump Tariff Market Crash: Donald Trump says he didn't check his 401K.

Did Fox News remove its ticker when the stock market collapsed?



President Donald Trump Thursday said he didn't check his 401K account (retirement savings plan) when he was asked about the market crash as a result of his tariffs on about 60 countries. ""I think it's going very well. It was an operation. Like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is,"" the president said a day after Liberation Day.While his reaction was called tone-deaf on social media, personal finance expert Michelle Singletary in her column on Washington Post advised the same: don't look at your 401(k).""Like many of you, I’ve gone without some things I wanted — for decades — so that I could put money in a 401(k). I understand how worrisome this is when you’re the first generation in your family to have money in the stock market. And like you, I have contemplated what should I do on a day like today,"" she wrote.""Except for yelling, I don’t plan to change my investing strategy right now. In fact, I haven’t looked at my 401(k) since the markets began to skid in reaction to Trump’s tariffs.""Some things are better left unseen, the adviser wrote. ""If you have a good long-term investment plan and you’re years away from having to tap your retirement funds, don’t keep checking on how the daily stock swings are affecting your retirement account.""Fox News' Jeanine Pirro urged the audience Thursday to ignore the pain for the ""sake of patriotic dedication to the president"". “I don't really care about my 401k today. You know why?... I believe in this man,” Pirro said. “Who’s complaining? Wall Street. Too bad, he’s helping the middle class. I think it’s gonna be over this summer.”Social media users flagged that Fox apparently removed the stock market ticker for the first time in 28 years. Fox dismissed the claim and said Fox never deploys the stock ticker full-time. “These claims on social media that this is the first time in 28 years the ticker has come down are not accurate. The stock ticker has never been deployed on screen on a full-time basis,"" a rep for Fox News told TV Insider.","President Donald Trump Thursday said he didn't check his 401K account (retirement savings plan) when he was asked about the market crash.

Despite a strong US jobs report, panic selling swept Wall Street and Europe, as investors braced for what many now see as an economic reckoning.The S&P 500 nosedived 5% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since the pandemic crash in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,656 points, or 4.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 5.5%. Crude oil prices sank to 2021 levels, and industrial metals like copper dropped on worries of slowing global growth.The sell-off accelerated after China announced it would match President Donald Trump’s 34% tariff hike on Chinese imports with its own 34% tariffs on all US goods, effective April 10. The tit-for-tat escalation comes just a day after Trump warned Americans might feel “some pain” from his trade strategy, comparing the economic disruption to surgery.“For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.The US jobs report provided a brief pause to the carnage. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, reinforcing hopes that the US economy remains resilient. But analysts warned the data is backward-looking and does little to address forward risks.“Markets are now focused on what comes next. This is no longer about how strong the US was—it’s about whether it can withstand a trade war-induced slowdown,” said Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock.Some of the sharpest losses were among US companies exposed to China. DuPont fell nearly 17% after China’s regulators launched an anti-trust probe into its Chinese subsidiary. GE Healthcare, which gets 14% of its revenue from China, sank 13.3%. United Airlines, heavily reliant on Asia-Pacific routes, dropped 12.6%.On his social media platform Truth Social, Trump dismissed China’s move: “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!”Bond markets also flashed red. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 3.90%, down from 4.06% the previous day, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to cut interest rates to cushion the blow.But with tariffs driving up prices, the Fed could face a tightrope: lower rates may ease economic pressure but risk stoking inflation, leaving US households squeezed by rising costs.Abroad, the damage was widespread. Germany’s DAX index fell 5.2%, France’s CAC 40 lost 4.6%, and Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.8%.Vietnam and the European Union have both signaled intentions to negotiate with the US, but for now, the world’s two largest economies remain locked in economic combat — and markets are running scared.","The S&P 500 nosedived 5% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since the pandemic crash in 2020.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of carbon use per year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

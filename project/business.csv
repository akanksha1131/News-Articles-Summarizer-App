Rupee in green: Currency rises 9 paise to 90.25 against US dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-in-green-currency-rises-9-paise-to-90-25-against-us-dollar/articleshow/127968836.cms,"Rupee Slips Past 92 Mark Against Dollar As Equity Outflows, Dollar Demand And Market Fear Build Up

Rupee opened in green on Friday, climbing 9 paise to 90.25 against the US dollar, as currency markets reacted to optimism around the India-US trade deal but remained cautious ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy announcement.The early gains came after the currency ended Thursday’s session higher by 13 paise at 90.34 against the greenback. According to forex traders, while sentiment has improved, rupee’s movement continues to be constrained by strong corporate demand for dollars and weakness in domestic equities. Market participants are also said to be shifting from initial optimism to scrutiny, as neither India nor the US has released formal documents outlining the agreement.On Thursday, rupee opened at 90.52 in the interbank foreign exchange market, moved to an intraday high of 90.06 and a low of 90.53, before settling at 90.34, marking a gain of 13 paise over the previous close.Attention is also on the Reserve Bank of India, where the six-member Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor Sanjay Malhotra began deliberations on Wednesday. The policy decision will be announced on Friday morning.Experts said the RBI has already cut the repo rate by 125 basis points since last February and may maintain a pause, although some believe another rate cut remains possible to further lower borrowing costs.Meanwhile on the stock market front, equity benchmarks opened on a subdued note on Friday, slipping into negative territory as investors adopted a wait-and-watch approach ahead of MPC decision.At the opening bell, the Nifty 50 fell 37 points, or 0.14%, to 25,605.80, while the BSE Sensex edged down 64.61 points, or 0.08%, to 83,249.32.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmarks, ended Friday’s session in positive territory after the Reserve Bank of India left its key policy rate unchanged, in line with market expectations, and proposed permitting banks to extend loans to Real Estate Investment Trusts with appropriate prudential norms to broaden funding avenues for the real estate sector.The BSE Sensex rose 266.47 points, or 0.32 per cent, to close at 83,580.40, recovering sharply from an intraday low of 82,925.35 as late buying lifted the index by 655.05 points toward the close.

$2 trillion wiped off crypto markets!

Bitcoin wipes out gains since Trump’s election

Broader digital asset holdings also hit

Fed concerns and investor outflows

Tech sector weakness piles pressure on crypto segment

Cryptogiant Bitcoin has suffered sharp losses since the beginning of 2026, tumbling over 20%. The digital currency has given up almost half of its value since October’s record peak of over $124,000, sliding to $67,000, now worth less than it was at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term. Bitcoin is often pitched as “digital gold” as its returns are just like gold, offering no dividends or profits and price driven by what investors are willing to pay. The world’s largest cryptocurrency was last trading 1.64% higher at $64,153.24 after a volatile session that saw prices swing between gains and losses, having earlier touched a low of $60,008.52.The global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since peaking at $4.379 trillion in early October, with $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone, Reuters reported. Bitcoin has declined 28% so far this year, while ether has lost nearly 38% over the same period.As the asset slid, shares of companies holding bitcoin and other digital assets also came under heavy pressure amid ongoing turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, fuelling concerns about stress across the sector. Publicly listed firms that piled into crypto last year, encouraged by US President Donald Trump’s supportive stance, are now grappling with intensifying market challenges.The decline comes as uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate cuts and concerns over AI company valuations weigh on risk assets, pushing bitcoin to its lowest level since November 2024.MicroStrategy’s bitcoin-focused arm, Strategy, has seen shares tumble from $457 in July to $111.27 on Thursday, marking their lowest level since August 2024. The stock was last down more than 11%, according to Reuters.In December, Strategy cut its 2025 earnings forecast, citing weak bitcoin performance, and announced plans to create a reserve to support dividend payments. The company now expects full-year earnings between a $6.3 billion profit and a $5.5 billion loss, down from its earlier forecast of $24 billion.Other notable bitcoin buyers have also been hit. UK-based Smarter Web Company (SWC.L) fell nearly 18%, Nakamoto Inc (NAKA.O) lost almost 9%, and Japan’s Metaplanet (3350.T) dropped over 7%.Bitcoin itself is down nearly 28% since the start of the year, with recent selling accelerating after Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Analysts cited by Reuters say that Warsh’s appointment could lead to a smaller Fed balance sheet, a negative for speculative assets like crypto.Bitcoin has erased all gains made since Trump’s election, when he pledged to overhaul policies toward digital assets. The cryptocurrency last traded at $67,651.“As Bitcoin continues its slide below the psychological barrier of $70,000, it’s clear the crypto market is now in full capitulation mode,"" said Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau. ""If previous cycles are anything to go by, this is no longer a short-term correction, but rather a transition... and these typically take months, not weeks,"" Reuters cited the expert.Companies holding other tokens have been affected as well. Alt5 Sigma, which stocks the Trump family’s WLFI token, fell 8.4%. SharpLink Gaming, holding ether, dropped 8%, while Forward Industries, which holds solana, fell nearly 6%.Bitcoin fell to a low of $63,295.74 on Thursday, its weakest since October 2024, before rebounding slightly to $63,525, marking its largest one-day drop since November 2022. Approximately $1 billion in bitcoin positions were liquidated over 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.Trump’s Fed pick, Kevin Warsh, has added to market fears. Analysts say investors worry that a smaller balance sheet will remove liquidity support for speculative assets.""The market fears a hawk with him,"" Manuel Villegas Franceschi from Julius Baer told Reuters. ""A smaller balance sheet is not going to provide any tailwinds for crypto.""Deutsche Bank analysts highlighted massive outflows from institutional ETFs as a key driver of the decline.US spot bitcoin ETFs saw over $3 billion withdrawn in January, following $2 billion and $7 billion outflows in December and November, respectively. ""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" they said.The slide in cryptocurrencies has been compounded by a broader downturn in tech stocks, particularly software companies linked to AI. Bitcoin and other tokens have historically tracked risk appetite in technology markets, and the current weakness has intensified losses.""Concerns are being raised around the crypto miners and whether we could be looking at forced liquidations if prices continue to fall, which could lead to a vicious cycle,"" said Jefferies strategist Mohit Kumar, as cited by Reuters. The analyst further added that crypto “should never be more than a very small portion of a portfolio, but its heavy retail ownership adds to overall market risk.""","Global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since peaking at $4.379 trillion in early October, with $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone.

Gold and silver price prediction: Gold and silver prices have resumed their upward momentum after the recent crash, signalling bullish momentum, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group. He shares his views on gold and silver:MCX Gold on the weekly timeframe has undergone a correction from its all-time high of 180,779. However, prices have found support at the rising trendline and have rebounded, indicating a resumption of the bullish trend. The recent acceleration reinforces the strength and sustainability of the move, and the broader outlook remains positive as long as prices hold above the weekly low.From a weekly standpoint, the 147,000 region stands out as a crucial support, aligned with the 30-days exponential moving average. Any pullback toward this zone is expected to draw fresh buying interest, helping to limit downside risk in the near term. Sustaining above this level keeps the bullish structure intact and supports ongoing positive momentum.Gold looks well positioned to move toward the 175,000 mark in the coming sessions, and a decisive close above this level would validate the bullish bias for subsequent periods.This potential upside aligns with the broader uptrend and highlights the strength of prevailing momentum. Moreover, the formation of higher highs and higher lows over the week further supports positive sentiment and points to the likelihood of a sustained upward move.Overall, gold continues to exhibit a positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly supporting trend continuation. As long as prices stay comfortably above the key 147,000 support level, the bullish setup remains valid. Backed by strong momentum indicators and a supportive market sentiment environment, the metal appears well placed to carry its upward move forward in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has seen a healthy pullback from its all-time high of 420,048 and has since rebounded from recent lows, signalling a resumption of the bullish trend. With the underlying trend still positive, any ongoing dips may be viewed as buying opportunities as long as the latest weekly low holds. We advise aligning positions with the prevailing uptrend, while maintaining a controlled stop-loss at the recent weekly lows.Silver’s rally at the start of the week signals a renewed bullish trend and strengthens the outlook for further upside. As long as prices remain above the weekly support levels, the positive bias is expected to persist. Immediate key support is seen around the 245,000 zone, and a close below this level could weaken the bullish outlook. Until then, any pullback is likely to attract fresh buying interest, sustaining upward momentum.On the upside, silver appears well positioned to test the 330,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This prospective move points to a continuation of the prevailing bullish phase, backed by strong momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, provided prices remain firmly above the 245,000 support level, silver is expected to sustain its uptrend, with ample scope for further appreciation as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Gold and silver prices have resumed their upward momentum after the recent crash, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Nifty has been on a roller coaster from the start of this calendar month with India VIX seeing over 80% gain in volatility from January 01, 2026. With large gap up opening unable to sustain, the gap between last week highs and this week’s low is likely to get filled sooner this month. This gap however, should be used to create longs with support seen at the rising 200 DMA for targets of 25940 / 26100.Bank Nifty has already done what we are expecting Nifty to do, which is it has tested its last week’s highs in yesterday’s volatile session. Breaking of current week’s low and reversing near 59700 odd is likely to be used as an opportunity to create fresh longs on the index, as Bank Nifty has experienced 59650 as significant resistance over the past 9 weeks of trade and the same is likely to act as support based on classical technical thesis.After its initial breakout from 15 month sloping trendline, PETRONET had been lacking triggers making it wait within a 6-8% band. With the 200 DMA now supportively reclaimed and stock closing at 6 month highs, momentum buyers could come in. Given the set up an 8-10% rally can unfold.MRPL has recovered over 30% in the last 9 trading sessions given its reversal from the 200 DMA support. A repetitive higher low formation was also seen on weekly charts of the same.Stock is on the verge of closing at 16 month highs on weekly charts if it retains at CMP until Friday’s close which also corresponds to an end to the stock’s 2 year corrective phase.CCL had been consolidating for the past 12 weeks with a negative bias correcting over 15% from its all time highs. With lower high formations seen from the start of this calendar year and a trendline breakout of this consolidation seen this week, prices indicate a start of a fresh up move unfolding back to its previous highs.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, the top buy calls for today are: PETRONET, MRPL, and CCL.

NEW DELHI: India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on a wide range of US food and agricultural products, a move that is expected to make several American imports cheaper for Indian consumers, according to a joint statement released by India and the United States on Saturday announcing the framework for an interim trade agreement.Products that are set to see tariff cuts include dried distillers’ grains (DDGs), red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, and wine and spirits. The tariff changes are part of reciprocal commitments outlined in the interim pact aimed at easing trade tensions and improving market access on both sides.“The US and India are pleased to announce that they have reached a framework for an Interim Agreement regarding reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade,” the joint statement said.Under the framework, the United States will reduce tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%. The higher duties had been imposed after trade talks stalled, with 25% of the tariffs introduced in August when Washington accused New Delhi of supporting Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine through oil purchases.The interim agreement also reaffirms the commitment of both countries to continue negotiations on a broader US-India Bilateral Trade Agreement.These talks were launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump in February 2025 following months of strain in trade ties.As part of the framework, India has agreed to address long-standing non-tariff barriers affecting US exports, including in medical devices, information and communication technology goods, and food and agricultural products. The two sides also plan to establish rules of origin to ensure trade benefits accrue mainly to India and the United States.On the US side, Washington will apply a reciprocal tariff rate of 18% on Indian-origin goods, including textiles, apparel, leather and footwear, plastics, chemicals, home décor, artisanal products and certain machinery. Subject to the successful conclusion of the interim agreement, the US has also said it will remove reciprocal tariffs on a wider set of Indian exports, including generic pharmaceuticals, gems and diamonds, and aircraft parts.The framework further includes commitments on easing tariffs on certain aircraft and aircraft parts, cooperation on supply chain resilience, and addressing barriers to digital trade. India has also indicated it intends to purchase $500 billion worth of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products and coking coal over the next five years.Both countries said they will work towards promptly implementing the framework and finalising the interim agreement, with the longer-term objective of concluding a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement",India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on a wide range of US food and agricultural products.

Govt receives fin bids for IDBI’s strategic selloff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-receives-fin-bids-for-idbis-strategic-selloff/articleshow/128014070.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt has received financial bids for the strategic disinvestment of IDBI Bank, signalling progress in the stake sale process of the lender.“They will be evaluated as per the prescribed procedure,” secretary, department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), said on microblogging site X while announcing that bids have been received. He did not give details. Indian-Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax is learnt to be among the bidders.The strategy involves selling a combined 60.7% stake of govt and LIC and is expected to fetch about Rs 33,000 crore, with a winner likely to be announced by March-end 2026.The transaction would mark the country’s first privatisation of a former state-owned bank through a two-step route which involved state insurer Life Insurance Corporation-led rescue that resulted in its reclassification as a private sector bank.This was followed by the start of a strategic sale process, which unlike direct auctions such as the one involving Air India, would transfer full management control to a private owner, setting a precedent for hybrid exits in banking reform.IDBI Bank’s privatisation traces back to its 2019 rescue by LIC, which injected Rs 21,000 crore for nearly 49.2% stake to stabilise the lender amid mounting bad loans or non performing assets (NPAs), shifting control from govt to the state-owned insurer. Formal divestment was announced in Budget 2020, followed by expressions of interest in 2022 and RBI’s “fit and proper” clearances by 2024 for bidders which included Kotak Mahindra Bank, Emirates NBD and Fairfax India.","The strategy involves selling a combined 60.7% stake of govt and LIC.

US corn resisted over GM food concerns

NEW DELHI: Animal feed, ethanol for fuel, poultry, flowers and tea are likely to be among items on the negative list for import concessions given to the US under the first tranche of bilateral trade deal, for which a joint statement is expected in the next few days, reports Sidhartha.In line with commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal's assertion that India's sensitivities in agriculture and dairy have been protected, persons familiar with the deliberations told TOI that rice, wheat, other cereals, dairy products, soymeal, maize, meats and genetically modified food products are the other items on the list where India is not offering any tariff concessions.In addition, they said that potatoes, onion, garlic, copra, atta, chicken and tobacco are also expected to be outside the ambit of the first tranche of the framework agreement. Those familiar with the discussions said even in other product segments, govt will go for calibrated opening up, opting for quotas in products such as apples, something it has done with the EU and New Zealand, while also opting for a long phasing period.India has so far managed to keep dairy and agriculture outside the ambit of its trade deals, including the ones with the UK and the European Union, and has made a strong effort to continue with protection for vulnerable sections of society.Officials have argued, including with the US, that Indian farmers have small land holdings with several of them undertaking subsistence farming and allowing even limited quantities of wheat and rice would be detrimental to their interests.Genetically modified food is the other area of concern given that govt has reservations on allowing such products into the country and allowing American corn would have opened the doors to GM food, something that was being resisted. One of the options was to allow ethanol blending but that would upset sugarcane growers.India's import of agricultural goods from the UK are pegged at over $2 billion, while exports are around $3.4 billion. As part of the framework agreement for BTA, the US agreed to lower reciprocal tariff for Indian exports into its market to 18%, from 50%, which includes 25% secondary or penal tariffs for New Delhi purchasing Russian oil.","Animal feed, ethanol for fuel, poultry, flowers and tea are likely to be among items on the negative list for import concessions given to the US under the first tranche of bilateral trade deal.

Govt officials said with most villages in India now electrified, REC’s terms of reference are no longer contemporary and the merger will help it focus on meeting the large funding needs of the power sector.Currently, REC finances the entire power sector — including generation, transmission, distribution and renewable energy — and has diversified into roads, metro and IT infrastructure.In March 2019, govt had allowed PFC to acquire its 52.6% stake in REC for Rs 14,500 crore, turning the latter into a subsidiary. It also helped the Centre show the funds as “disinvestment receipts” and meet its receipts target for the year. Both public sector enterprises are non-banking infrastructure finance companies.REC share price fell 3% to Rs 373 on BSE, while PFC closed 1% higher at Rs 419.In her Budget speech last Sunday, Sitharaman said: “The vision for NBFCs for Viksit Bharat has been outlined with clear targets for credit disbursement and technology adoption.

Tata Steel profits up 9x on improved sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-steel-profits-up-9x-on-improved-sales/articleshow/128013908.cms,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel’s consolidated profit surged multifold to Rs 2,730 crore in Q3FY26, aided by higher sales volumes despite weak steel prices. Its profit in Q3FY25 was Rs 296 crore. Domestic production volumes increased 11%, while delivery volumes grew 14%, driven by improved capacity utilisation at its Kalinganagar and Jamshedpur plants.Quarterly deliveries crossed six million tonnes for the first time for Tata Steel in India. This lifted the TV Narendran-led company’s revenue from operations by 6% to Rs 57,002 crore. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) from India operations grew nearly 5% to Rs 8,291 crore during the quarter.Steel prices, however, remained weak for most of the quarter as global supply outpaced demand, dragging down flat product prices. Prices have shown signs of recovery since Dec, aided by policy support from govt. Last month, India imposed a three-year import tariff on select steel products to curb imports from China, replacing a 12% duty that had been introduced in April for 200 days. The longer-duration levy is expected to provide greater protection to domestic steelmakers.","Quarterly deliveries crossed six million tonnes for the first time for Tata Steel in India.

Pushing for adoption of

lab-grown diamonds

MUMBAI: Amid steep rise in gold prices , Indian consumers are going for exchanges-swapping old gold for new and are also advancing their purchases of wedding jewellery to avoid bearing the brunt of even higher rates given gold's glittering rally amid geopolitical tensions.""Right now, people are concerned about rates spiralling even more although there has been some cooling off in the last few days or so. We have seen a significant jump in exchange-led sales,"" said Arun Narayan, CEO, jewellery division at Titan Company. In fact, for Tanishq, close to half of its sales now have an element of exchange in it, Narayan who took over the CEO's office in Jan following a long stint in the company, told TOI.Prices of the yellow metal stood at close to Rs 1.5 lakh per 10 grams in spot market on Friday, having soared to as much as about Rs 1.8 lakh per 10 grams on Jan 29, increasing the cost burden for salaried, middle-class consumers. With heavy gold jewellery beyond reach for many now, the appetite for light-weight pieces has grown. In gold, for instance, consumers are now going for the 18 karat option. A similar trend is playing out in diamonds as well where 9 carat and 14 carat diamonds are gaining traction, Narayan said.""Despite inflation (in gold prices), demand has stayed resilient because in our country, gold is seen as a storehouse of value. The confidence in gold has only grown with the rates going up,"" Narayan said, projecting a good ongoing wedding season.As far as gold purchase for investment purposes is concerned, coins have seen the highest growth recently, Narayan said.Having long shunned the idea of venturing into the lab-grown diamonds space, Titan recently forayed into the category with brand beYon, tactically positioning its first (and only one now) store in Mumbai opposite a Tanishq outlet. The strategy behind the move, Narayan said, is to push adoption and consumption of diamonds which is still very aspirational but as a category, has a mere 10%-12% penetration. The idea is to nudge consumers into diamond buying through lab-grown diamonds, eventually getting them to upgrade to natural diamonds, Narayan said. ""beYon has the role to increase adoption and frequency (of buying). The pricing is the sweetest at beYon and we expect we can nurture that customer over time to Mia, CaratLane or Tanishq,"" Narayan added.Lab-grown diamonds are priced significantly lower than natural diamonds, increasing their appeal. The segment is projected to account for about 16% of the global diamond market by 2029, up from nearly 12% in 2024, research firm Redseer said in a report last year.","Indian consumers are going for exchanges-swapping old gold for new.

How Trump's claims on tariffs are far from reality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-trumps-claim-on-tariffs-are-far-from-reality/articleshow/128000245.cms,"Beyond Tariffs: The India–US Deal and the Politics of Oil

Here is what Trump claimed and how far were they from facts

""Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST” country anywhere in the world!""

US was not dead when he returned to the Oval office for his second stint for POTUS. Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

In 2024, the last year of the Biden presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023.

presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023. Meanwhile, first three quarters show that Trump’s tariffs - or even the threat of them - produced mixed outcomes. However, Full-year data for 2025 is not yet available.

From January to March, US GDP contracted for the first time in three years. The reason was clear: imports surged as American companies rushed to stock up on foreign goods ahead of potential tariff hikes. Since imports are subtracted from GDP, the spike dragged growth into negative territory.

The slowdown proved temporary. Growth rebounded sharply in the second quarter, with the economy expanding at an annualised rate of 3.8% from April to June. Momentum strengthened further in the third quarter, when growth accelerated to 4.4%. The rebound was driven in part by a decline in imports, reflecting both the impact of tariffs and earlier stockpiling. Strong consumer spending also played a major role.

Trump has also pointed to gains in the US stock market, noting that stocks hit record highs 52 times in 2025. While the market did post solid gains, its performance lagged several global peers.

“Annual core inflation for the past three months has dropped to just 1.4% - far lower than almost anyone, other than me, had predicted.”

According to news agency AP, Trump is using cherry-picked data to vastly exaggerate where inflation stands. Trump’s preferred inflation figure - annual inflation over the past three months excluding food and energy - is low. But it is also distorted. A government shutdown in October and November disrupted data collection, forcing the statistical agency to rely on rough estimates in some categories, which artificially pushed overall inflation lower.

Core inflation over the final six months of 2025 stood at 2.6%. That is lower than January 2025 levels but roughly in line with October 2024. Overall inflation has largely plateaued this year. It was running at 3% in September, before the shutdown - the same level as in January 2025.

It is true that inflation did not spike as sharply as many economists feared when Trump began rolling out tariffs last spring. But that is partly because many of the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were later withdrawn, scaled back or riddled with exemptions.

The impact of tariffs is clearer in core goods prices, which also exclude food and energy. Before the pandemic, core goods prices typically rose little or even fell year after year. By last December, however, they were 1.4% higher than a year earlier - the biggest increase outside the pandemic since 2011.

“The data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen… paying at least 80% of tariff costs.”

The study Trump cited appears to show the opposite. Co-authored by Cavallo, it finds that US consumers bore about 43% of the tariff-related costs after seven months, with most of the remainder absorbed by US firms.

Cavallo said import prices barely declined, suggesting foreign exporters did not cut prices enough to shoulder most of the burden.

“We have slashed our monthly trade deficit by an astonishing 77%.”

This figure also relies on cherry-picking - comparing an unusually large deficit in January 2025, when Trump took office, with an unusually small one in October. The broader trend is less flattering.

From January through November 2025, the US ran a trade deficit of nearly $840 billion, about 4% higher than during the same period in 2024.

Imports surged in the first three months of the year as companies rushed to buy foreign goods ahead of tariffs.

While monthly deficits fell later in the year, the early import spike was so large that the year-to-date deficit still exceeds last year’s.

""I have successfully used tariffs to secure colossal investments in America… more than $18 trillion.”

Trump did use tariff threats to extract investment pledges from trading partners. The European Union alone promised $600 billion over four years.

But the administration has not explained how it arrived at the $18 trillion figure.

The White House has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE.

has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE. They also caution that many pledges are vague and may never fully materialise, in part because some countries would struggle to finance them.

The numbers are large by any measure. Total private investment in the US currently runs at about $5.4 trillion annually. In 2024, foreign direct investment - money put into factories, offices and other physical assets - totaled just $151 billion.

US President Donald Trump has, at several occasions, claimed that broad tariffs on different countries has revived the American economy. In his recent opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Trump claimed that tariffs have created an ""American economic miracle. ""He also lamented on critics and economists who predicted that tariffs would backfire, raising prices and threatening growth.""When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,"" US president wrote.""Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!"" he added.However, it appears the US president is playing fast and loose with his claims, which are often not supported by facts.","Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

Iran’s IRGC ‘CAPTURE’ Two Foreign Oil Tankers, Send Message To Trump Ahead Of Iran-US Nuke Talks

The United States on Friday announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade, hours after indirect talks between Tehran and Washington concluded in Oman.The move came even as both sides signalled willingness to continue negotiations aimed at easing tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme.The sanctions, unveiled by the US State Department, target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s “shadow fleet,” which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions, according to Reuters.In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said that the measures were part of the Trump administration’s renewed pressure campaign against Tehran.“President Donald Trump is committed to driving down the Iranian regime's illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration's maximum pressure campaign,” Pigott said.The United States said that the fresh sanctions were aimed at cutting off revenue streams that Tehran uses to fund repression at home and destabilising activities abroad.Pigott accused Tehran of prioritising repression and regional destabilisation over domestic welfare.“Instead of investing in the welfare of its own people and crumbling infrastructure, the Iranian regime continues to fund destabilizing activities around the world and step up its repression inside Iran,” he said.Warning of continued pressure, he added: “So long as Iranian regime attempts to evade sanctions and generate oil and petrochemical revenues to fund such oppressive behavior and support terrorist activities and proxies, the United States will act to hold both the Iranian regime and its partners accountable.”Among the entities sanctioned by the United States is an India-based firm involved in managing a vessel accused of transporting Iranian petroleum products in violation of international restrictions.According to the US State Department, Elevate Marine Management Private Limited (ELEVATE), an Indian commercial shipping management company, served as the commercial manager of the BENEDICT, a Cameroon-flagged crude oil tanker. The vessel is alleged to have transported Iranian petroleum products on at least three occasions between September and November 2025.Akash Anant Shinde is an Indian national and director of Elevate Marine Management Private Limited.The announcement came shortly after Iranian and US officials wrapped up a day of indirect negotiations in Muscat, mediated by Oman. The talks were described as constructive by TehranIran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking after the talks, struck a cautiously optimistic tone, calling the discussions “a good start.”“If we can go along with this positive path, I can say that we can reach a positive framework regarding the nuclear talks between Iran and the US,” Araghchi told reporters.He said both sides had agreed to continue discussions after further consultations in their respective capitals.“Our concerns were conveyed, as well as our interests and the rights that the Iranian people have. It was conveyed in a very good atmosphere, and the views of the other side were also heard,” he added.According to Oman’s foreign ministry, foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi met separately with Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in Muscat.Footage later released by Oman’s state news agency showed US Navy Admiral Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command also present.The negotiations mark the first formal engagement since the United States joined Israel’s military action against Iran in June, during which US strikes damaged Iranian nuclear facilities.Israel also targeted Iran’s air defence systems and ballistic missile infrastructure. Since then, Washington has bolstered its military presence in the region, deploying additional warships, fighter jets and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.US officials have indicated that Washington wants the talks to go beyond Iran’s nuclear programme to include its missile capabilities and regional influence. Iran, however, has insisted that discussions remain limited.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations earlier this week, saying, “I’m not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we’re going to try to find out.”Tensions remain high as both sides weigh diplomacy against the risk of escalation. The US has recently shot down an Iranian drone near the USS Abraham Lincoln, while Iran has attempted to stop a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz.Friday’s sanctions also follow similar measures imposed last month, when the US targeted vessels accused of moving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil.The Treasury Department has said that Iran’s shadow fleet plays a critical role in financing the regime, including its domestic crackdowns and regional activities.","The sanctions target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s ‘shadow fleet,’ which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions.

AI spending worries hit Amazon

Bitcoin stabilises, crypto stocks jump

Consumers, airlines and smaller stocks gain

US stock markets moved higher on Friday, clawing back part of the heavy losses seen earlier in the week, as technology shares recovered and bitcoin halted its recent slide.The rebound came after several volatile sessions driven by worries over massive spending on artificial intelligence and its impact on corporate profits.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 776 points, or 1.6 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent by mid-morning trading in New York.Chipmakers led the recovery. Nvidia climbed 4.9 per cent, trimming a weekly decline of more than 10 per cent, while Broadcom gained 3.8 per cent after falling sharply earlier in the week.According to news agency AP, hopes of strong long-term demand for chips linked to artificial intelligence continued to support the sector.Despite the broader rebound, concerns over soaring AI investment remained. Amazon shares slumped 8.5 per cent after the company said it expects to spend around $200 billion this year on areas such as AI, chips, robotics and low-earth-orbit satellites.Similar spending plans announced earlier by Alphabet have raised questions about whether such large investments will deliver enough future profits.As per news agency AFP, investors have grown cautious after a period when enthusiasm around AI lifted much of the technology sector.Chris Low of FHN Financial said markets were now reassessing whether the sell-off had gone too far, noting that traders felt some of the recent declines may have been “overdone”.Even with Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 was still on course for its third weekly fall in four weeks.Bitcoin showed signs of stabilising after weeks of losses that wiped out more than half its value since its October peak.The cryptocurrency recovered to around $68,000 after briefly slipping near $60,000 late on Thursday.The move helped lift shares linked to the crypto sector. Robinhood Markets surged 11.7 per cent, Coinbase Global rose 7.3 per cent, and Strategy, a company known for holding large amounts of bitcoin, jumped 15.9 per cent.US consumer sentiment also provided some support. A preliminary survey from the University of Michigan showed sentiment improving slightly, defying expectations of a fall. The improvement was strongest among households that own shares.Airline stocks gained on hopes that stronger confidence would translate into more travel spending. United Airlines rose 5.4 per cent, American Airlines gained 4.6 per cent, and Delta Air Lines added 4.4 per cent.Smaller companies outperformed larger peers, with the Russell 2000 index climbing 2.3 per cent. These firms tend to be more sensitive to the strength of the US economy.In the bond market, US Treasury yields were largely steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at around 4.21 per cent, unchanged from late Thursday.","The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions.

Silver plunged by around 18 percent at one stage before recovering to trade near $70 an ounce, its lowest level since December. The metal had been trading above $121 just a week earlier. Gold also fell, shedding about two percent to sit just under $4,800, compared with its peak of $5,595 last Thursday.The recent slump in metals followed a surge in the US dollar last weekend after Trump appointed a relatively hawkish figure to lead the Federal Reserve, alongside easing geopolitical tensions.Cryptocurrencies were also caught in the sell-off. Bitcoin fell to its weakest level since October and narrowly avoided slipping below $60,000, wiping out gains linked to expectations of more crypto-friendly policies under Trump.

The figure also came in below economists’ expectations. Layoffs edged higher during the period, while the number of people voluntarily quitting jobs — an indicator of worker confidence — remained broadly unchanged at 3.2 million.The data highlights a widening gap between economic expansion and hiring momentum. While gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace in two years during the July–September quarter, job creation has slowed significantly. Employers have added an average of just 28,000 jobs per month since March, compared with roughly 400,000 monthly additions during the post-pandemic hiring surge between 2021 and 2023.Upcoming labour market data is expected to show modest improvement. Economists anticipate that January employment numbers, due next week, may show around 70,000 new jobs added, up from 50,000 in December.Recent private data has also pointed to subdued hiring conditions. Payroll processor ADP reported that private sector employers added only 22,000 jobs last month, far below market forecasts. Separately, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said companies announced more than 108,000 job cuts, the highest monthly total since October and the weakest January reading since 2009.Commenting on the trend, Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said: “The hiring recession isn’t going to end anytime soon. Job openings in December just fell to their lowest level since September 2020. It’s yet another sign of how little hiring – or interest in hiring – is happening in this economy.”Economists remain divided on the outlook, debating whether hiring will eventually pick up to match strong economic growth, whether growth may slow to reflect labour market weakness, or whether advances in artificial intelligence and automation could allow output to expand without significant job creation.","US job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November.

Layoffs edged higher during the period, while the number of people voluntarily quitting jobs remained broadly unchanged at 3.2 million.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127945344,imgsize-762182,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"US markets today: Tech-led selloff drags S&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq lower; bitcoin, gold, silver fall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-alphabet-drags-wall-street-lower-bitcoin-gold-and-silver-slide/articleshow/127942590.cms,"US markets declined sharply on Thursday as losses in technology stocks, led by Alphabet, combined with weak labour market signals to weigh on investor sentiment, according to AP.The S&P 500 fell 1.2% and was heading toward its sixth loss in seven sessions after recently touching a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 606 points, or 1.2%, while the Nasdaq composite declined 1.5% as of 10:45 a.m. Eastern time.Alphabet was the biggest drag on the market, falling 4.3% despite reporting stronger quarterly profit than analysts expected. Investors instead focused on the company’s aggressive spending plans on artificial intelligence. Alphabet said its spending on equipment and other investments could double this year to about $180 billion, far exceeding analysts’ expectations of less than $119 billion, according to FactSet.Bond markets also reflected risk-off sentiment. Treasury yields fell after data showed US unemployment benefit applications rose more than economists expected, signalling potential acceleration in layoffs. Additional data showed layoffs announced by US-based employers surged to 108,435 last month, the highest monthly total since October and the worst January reading since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Separate government data showed job openings declined in December compared with both the previous month and year-ago period, hitting their lowest level in more than five years.The weaker labour market outlook could increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to support growth, even as it risks fuelling inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.21% from 4.29% late Wednesday.Commodity markets saw even sharper volatility. Silver plunged 13.3% in its latest sharp swing after last week’s record rally ended. Gold fell 2.3% to $4,838.80 per ounce, after touching nearly $5,600 last week and falling below $4,500 earlier this week.Both precious metals had surged earlier as investors sought safer assets amid political uncertainty, high valuations in equities and rising global debt concerns. Analysts had warned such rapid gains were unsustainable and due for correction. Bitcoin also fell sharply, dropping below $68,000 from its record above $124,000 reached in October. The decline hit crypto-linked stocks, with Coinbase Global falling 8.3% and Strategy dropping 11.9%.Among other stocks, Qualcomm declined 7.2% despite beating profit and revenue expectations, as its current-quarter profit forecast disappointed amid industry memory shortages affecting handset demand.Estee Lauder also beat Wall Street expectations and raised full-year forecasts but warned tariff-related pressures could erase about $100 million in profits. Its shares dropped 21.2%.Some stocks benefited from continued AI-related spending. Chipmaker Broadcom rose 3.7%, helping limit broader market losses. McKesson surged 16.8% after posting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue and raising its profit outlook for the fiscal year.Global markets also weakened. London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.9% after the Bank of England held rates steady. France’s CAC 40 declined 0.7%, and Germany’s DAX fell 0.9% after the European Central Bank also kept rates unchanged.In Asia, South Korea’s Kospi dropped 3.9% from record levels, while Samsung Electronics fell 6%, reversing part of gains made earlier in the week.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 606 points, or 1.2%, while the Nasdaq composite declined 1.5%.

The decline comes after Bitcoin had touched a record high above $126,000 in October.“Bitcoin continues to suffer... caught up in the broader risk-off mood and geopolitical turmoil that has pushed investors away from riskier assets towards safe havens,” said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor.Bitcoin had surged following Trump’s election, as he was widely viewed as supportive of the crypto sector. He had also publicly celebrated Bitcoin crossing $100,000 for the first time in December 2024.The cryptocurrency, however, has seen sharp swings. In April last year, Bitcoin fell below $75,000 after Trump announced sweeping US tariffs that rattled global markets. It later rebounded and hit a record high of $126,251.31 six months later.The latest weakness has also been linked to regulatory uncertainty. While the US Congress passed a law in July to regulate stablecoins, a broader cryptocurrency bill, the Clarity Act, remains stalled in the Senate.Bitcoin has also been hit by Trump’s nomination of former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to head the US central bank. Warsh is seen by observers as a defender of the Fed’s independence, which reassured traditional markets and prompted investors to sell safe-haven assets such as gold and silver, whose prices fell.Investors have also sold cryptocurrencies and other risk assets to raise cash, adding to pressure on digital tokens.Trump’s close ties to the crypto sector have also drawn criticism, as he has promoted his own cryptocurrency-related ventures since returning to office. Bloomberg estimates said his family’s fortune grew by $1.4 billion last year from digital assets.Hours before his inauguration in January 2025, Trump launched his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, which later fell after an initial surge following its debut.","Crypto dropped to as low as $69,821.18 before moving back above the $70,000 level.

Silver price today: Silver prices fell heavily on Thursday, giving back all gains made over the previous two sessions, as the metal continued to struggle after a historic market crash. Gold also moved lower as pressure remained across precious metals.Spot silver dropped as much as 16.6% during the session, even after briefly climbing back above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. Gold prices were also volatile, sliding by as much as 3.5%.“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd told Bloomberg. He added that this highlights fragile sentiment and has triggerd “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity.”The sharp fall follows a strong rally last month, when precious metals rose quickly due to speculative buying, global geopolitical tensions and worries over the independence of the US central bank. That rally ended abruptly late last week. Silver recorded its biggest ever one-day fall on Friday, while gold saw its steepest drop since 2013.Markets are now focused on the policy outlook after Kevin Warsh was nominated as the next Federal Reserve chair. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would not have chosen Warsh if he had supported raising interest rates. In an interview with NBC News, Trump said there was “not much” doubt the Federal Reserve would cut rates again, which usually supports precious metals as they do not offer interest.“Price action is likely to remain volatile until there is greater certainty on the monetary policy outlook,” Standard Chartered Plc analysts including Sudakshina Unnikrishnan said in a note. They said some of the recent swings were caused by investors pulling money out of exchange-traded products, but added that “structural drivers remain intact and we continue to expect a rebuild to the upside.”By 11:18 am in Singapore, silver was trading 12.7% lower at $76.9495 an ounce.

No assistance

Around the crack of dawn, a line begins forming at a strip mall in Hyattsville, Maryland, as residents ranging from students to delivery workers and federal contractors wait to sign up for food assistance.""Right now, it's a lot -- paying rent, buying food,"" said Shirleyann Desormeaux, a chef supporting four children in her household.Even with two incomes, ""it's still not enough,"" the 58-year-old added.She said she was keen to work, but has experienced having her hours cut as businesses struggle too.Desormeaux was among 100 or so people turning up in near-freezing temperatures in Hyattsville, a suburb of the US capital Washington, to seek groceries for their families, as anxiety about living costs rises in the world's biggest economy.Although US economic growth has been solid, with President Donald Trump's administration touting Wall Street records and tax relief, analysts warn that a ""K-shaped economy"" has taken hold.This is a situation where wealthier households benefit from rising asset values, but median- and lower-income families increasingly struggle.Nearly 60 percent of consumer spending in the third quarter last year came from the top 20 percent of income earners, according to Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics.In the greater Washington area, some 36 percent of households experienced food insecurity in the past year, according to the Capital Area Food Bank.""We're seeing more individuals in what we would traditionally consider higher-income quartiles,"" said Radha Muthiah, the food bank's CEO.That means a family of four making $90,000 to $120,000 a year could find themselves in need of ""extra assistance in putting food on the table,"" she told AFP.A key reason is ""prolonged, sustained levels of inflation"" after the Covid-19 pandemic, with wage growth not keeping pace, Muthiah said.""People are suffering,"" Desormeaux said.Salih Taylor, a federal worker, said he had not considered visiting a food drive until speaking with his church's pastor.""I used to be like, 'I've got food, I don't need it,'"" the 49-year-old told AFP. But he conceded: ""It helps out a lot.""Food prices in December were 3.1 percent higher than a year ago, although Trump has said there is ""virtually no inflation.""While Taylor makes around $4,200 a month, his salary quickly goes towards his mortgage, utilities and food.Now, he occasionally collects free groceries, including for his mother.""I'm scraping,"" he chuckled dryly, saying his family has cut back on eating out and going on longer drives.Pastor Oliver Carter of No Limits Outreach Ministries, which runs the distribution point in Hyattsville, said he sees rising demand and more immigrants seeking aid since food stamps were slashed for many asylum seekers.""Now, they're left to fend for themselves,"" he said.Federal funding cuts under the Trump administration also meant less support for food drives.""It's really a struggle now to continue doing what we do,"" he said.Beyond the US capital area, a New York Times/Siena poll in January flagged a widespread belief that a middle-class lifestyle is out of reach for most people.For Delaware resident Tricia Jones, who has lived in a hotel room with her husband and toddler for months, this sentiment strikes home.Jones, 46, temporarily lost her income source after spinal surgery last year. Her family was soon unable to afford rent, and she turned to GoFundMe at one point to raise funds.While Jones and her husband are both employed now, she said: ""The pay doesn't keep up with the cost of living.""""We don't get any assistance with childcare,"" she added. ""I couldn't even get assistance with a hotel voucher, because they told me that I work.""Meanwhile, the cost of groceries has climbed. A loaf of bread easily costs $6 and the price of milk has recently risen from $3.79 to $5.79, she said.With a salary of around $1,300, ""there's no way I can pay $1,800 a month for rent on top of all my utilities and childcare,"" she said.""There's no way to stretch it.""","Food bank: 36 percent of Washington area households experienced food insecurity in past year.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

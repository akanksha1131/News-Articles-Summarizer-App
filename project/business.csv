Gold prices fell last week as a stronger dollar, profit booking, easing US-China trade tensions dented safe-haven demand, with investors cautiously tracking major central bank meetings for fresh monetary policy cues. Dollar index inched towards the 100 mark, hitting a three-week high, while the USDINR strengthened, supporting domestic bullion sentiment.After, US and Chinese officials outlined a trade framework for Presidents Trump and Xi to finalize later last week, easing fears of renewed tariff escalation, leaders met and gave hope to market regarding a ease off in the trade war. China is expected to delay its rare earth licensing regime and resume US soybean purchases, signaling improving trade relations. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 bps to 3.75%–4.00%, second reduction this year, and announced an end to QT effective December 1.However, Chair Powell’s cautious tone and lack of commitment to further cuts pressured bullion, as markets reduced the odds of another rate cut in December. The US shutdown continues to cloud key data releases, adding uncertainty to the outlook.Over the weekend, Fed injected ~29.4B, indicating short term funding stress and an interesting move just as they announced end of QT from December 1st.Also, China removed a key tax break that earlier allowed gold retailers to offset VAT on gold brought from the Shanghai Gold exchange.Similarly, comments from China regarding the trade talks last week are still pending and further updates regarding the same could provide further weigh on prices.","Gold prices are likely to be weighed down by global developments in the near –term, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Groww IPO GMP :



Should you subscribe? Here’s what analysts’ say



About the initial public offering (IPO)



Financial figures







Investment app Groww opened its much awaited IPO for subscription on Tuesday, aiming to raise Rs 6,632 crore. The offer will be closing on November 7. At the upper price band, Groww’s valuation works out to 33.8 times FY25 earnings.Ahead of the IPO, Groww secured a little over Rs 2,984 crore from anchor investors on Monday.As per a circular published on the BSE website, the anchor portion drew interest from 102 funds. Among the prominent global investors were the government of Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.The company, officially known as Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd, began as a small startup in 2017.The initial public offering has a price band between Rs 95 and Rs 100 for each share.The IPO has a GMP of 14%, reflecting a healthy listing on the stock market, according to ET.""While valuations appear stretched in the near term, Groww’s strong fundamentals and customer stickiness make it a compelling long-term bet,"" Anand Rathi Research told ET.The brokerage highlighted India’s low demat penetration, only about 5% of adults have active broking accounts, as a major structural opportunity, and has assigned a ""Subscribe-Long Term"" rating to the IPO.Abhinav Tiwari, research analyst at Bonanza also gave a green signal for the platform.""Groww appears structurally stronger, with 59% EBITDA and 85% contribution margins, and has already achieved profitability,"" Tiwari told ET.However the platform’s dependence on trading volumes exposes it to regulatory risks in the F&O segment, the analyst flagged.“Diversification into lending and wealth management will be crucial to sustaining growth.""The IPO structure consists of two parts: a fresh issue worth Rs 1,060 crore and an offer for sale totalling Rs 5,572 crore by existing shareholders.The proceeds from the fresh shares will be used to strengthen cloud infrastructure, invest in branding and marketing, and fund two subsidiaries: Groww Creditserv Tech (the NBFC arm) and Groww Invest Tech (focused on margin trading facilities), according to ET.Kotak Mahindra Capital, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Axis Capital and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors are the lead managers to the IPO, while MUFG Intime is the registrar.The firm posted revenue from operations of Rs 3,901 crore in FY25, a 49% rise compared with the previous year. Profit after tax stood at Rs 1,824 crore, marking a shift from earlier losses. EBITDA margin climbed to 60.8%, supported by strong customer retention and lower spending on promotions, 78% of new users joined the platform organically.Groww services both aspirational customers with assets below Rs 25 lakh and affluent users, who contribute higher revenue per account. Average revenue per user increased from Rs 2,541 in FY23 to Rs 3,339 in FY25.However, even with a strong growth trajectory, the company faces risks including regulatory scrutiny of futures and options trading, reliance on brokerage income, which contributes 79.5% of revenue and overall market sentiment that could influence investor activity.","Investment app Groww opened its much awaited IPO for subscription on Tuesday, aiming to raise Rs 6,632 crore.

Mehli says Tata bye bye a week after his ouster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mehli-says-tata-bye-bye-a-week-after-his-ouster/articleshow/125099219.cms,"No mention of caveat in Mistry's letter to Trusts





MUMBAI: Days after filing a caveat before the Maharashtra charity commissioner, seeking a hearing before being ousted as a Tata Trusts trustee, Mehli Mistry said on Tuesday that he wished to ""part ways"" with the public charities, noting that ""precipitating matters would cause irreparable harm to the reputation of Tata Trusts"".Mistry's decision effectively de-escalates tensions within the powerful public charities and consolidates chairman Noel Tata's influence at the Trusts, and across the $180-billion Tata Group they control.Invoking Ratan Tata - ""dearest friend and mentor""- five times in a short letter to Noel Tata and three Tata charities, Mistry said his dedication to the former's ideals required him to avoid actions that could spark further controversy.A confidant of the late Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata and executor of his will, Mistry was denied reappointment last week as a lifelong trustee, ending his three-year tenure with the philanthropic arms of the group.Calling it a privilege to have served as trustee ""through personal endorsement"" of Ratan Tata until Oct 28, Mistry wrote, ""Therefore, in the spirit of Ratan N Tata, who always put public interest before his own, I hope that the actions of the other trustees going forward will be guided by the principles of transparency, good governance, and public interest.""He concluded his letter saying, ""I part ways with a quote that Ratan N Tata used to say to me - nobody is bigger than the institution it serves"". The letter made no reference to the caveat filed before the charity commissioner.Ever since Ratan Tata passed away in Oct last year, tensions have been simmering within the Trusts. These escalated and became evident in Sept when non-nominee directors of Tata Sons , led by Mistry, blocked the reappointment of Vijay Singh as a nominee director of the Trusts on the Tata Sons board. The move followed a review of nominee directors on the Tata Sons board who had reached the age of 75. Noel Tata and Trusts vice-chairman Venu Srinivasan, the other two nominee trustees on Tata Sons board, opposed Singh's removal. The non-nominee directors had suggested Mistry as Singh's replacement, but Noel rejected the proposal. Consequently, Singh, 77, resigned from the Tata Sons board.With the Trusts' long-held tradition of unanimity broken by the Mistry faction, Noel, along with Srinivasan and Singh, chose not to approve Mistry's reappointment as a lifelong trustee of the charities, bringing his tenure at Tata Trusts to an end on Oct 28.Mehli Mistry, a director of M Pallonji Group, with interests in shipping, dredging and car dealerships, is the first cousin of Noel's wife, Aloo. While his trusteeship ended at Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT), Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT), and Bai Hirabai JN Tata Navsari Charitable Institution Trust, it is not clear whether he will continue as a trustee of Tata Education and Development Trust (TEDT) and the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA). At TEDT, he is a lifelong trustee, while he serves as SRTT's nominee on the board of NCPA.SDTT and SRTT are the two main charities within Tata Trusts, together holding about 52% of Tata Sons and forming the core of decision-making within the Tata Group. However, TEDT is the most cash-rich foundation, with a corpus of about Rs 5,000 crore.","Mehli Mistry said he wished to ""part ways"" with the public charities, noting that ""precipitating matters would cause irreparable harm to the reputation of Tata Trusts"" His decision effectively de-escalates tensions within the powerful public charities and consolidates chairman Noel Tata's influence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125099238,imgsize-213826,width-400,resizemode-4/lk-19.jpg"

'Unfair, Unjustified': Piyush Goyal Exposes US Tariff Logic, Says India Won’t Accept One-Sided Rules





On the eve of a closely watched Supreme Court hearing, US President Donald Trump warned that the case could determine the country’s very survival — labeling it as a ""life or death"" situation for America’s economic and national security.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the hearing would decide whether the United States remains strong or becomes “virtually defenseless” in the face of global competition. Tomorrow’s United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country. With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security. Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us,"" he said.He argued that his ability to impose tariffs — a cornerstone of his trade policy — has been essential in protecting American industries and securing leverage in international negotiations. “Our stock market is hitting record highs, and our country has never been more respected than it is right now,” Trump wrote. “A big part of this is the economic security created by tariffs, and the deals that we have negotiated because of them.Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration was fully prepared for any outcome but expressed confidence in its legal footing ahead of the Supreme Court hearing. “The White House is always preparing for a plan B. It would be imprudent for the President’s advisors not to do so,” Leavitt said, adding that the administration stood “100 per cent behind the President and his team’s legal arguments and the merits of the law in this case. ” She said the White House remained optimistic that “the Supreme Court is going to do the right thing.”Leavitt emphasised that the implications of the case go beyond Trump’s presidency. “This isn’t just about President Trump — it’s about how future presidents can use emergency tariff powers,” she noted, reiterating that Trump considers economic security and national security to be “inseparable.”Trump’s global tariff policy will come under judicial scrutiny on Wednesday as the Supreme Court takes up a pivotal case testing the extent of his trade authority.The outcome could have far-reaching implications, though Trump’s sweeping tariffs on several countries are expected to remain in force regardless of how the Court rules.Trump, who has imposed multiple rounds of tariffs and secondary duties on a range of nations, will not attend the high-profile hearing. While he had earlier indicated an interest in being present, the President later said he decided against it to avoid turning the proceedings into a “distraction.”The US top court will weigh whether President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping import tariffs.Lower courts previously found that Trump lacked the legal basis under IEEPA to levy such duties but allowed the measures to remain in effect pending the Supreme Court’s final ruling.","The US top court will weigh whether President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) The outcome could have far-reaching implications, though Trump’s sweeping tariffs on several countries are expected to remain in force regardless of how the Court rules.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125100322,imgsize-1414482,width-400,resizemode-4/article-56.jpg"

MUMBAI: State Bank of India (SBI) reported a 10% rise in standalone net profit for the quarter ended Sept, aided by a one-time gain from the sale of its stake in Yes Bank and steady loan growth. During the quarter the bank's total business crossed the Rs 100 lakh crore-mark.The bank's standalone net profit climbed to Rs 20,160 crore from Rs 18,331 crore a year earlier.

Operating profit rose 8.9% to Rs 31,904 crore, reflecting resilient core performance despite rising funding costs.SBI's domestic net interest margin fell 18 basis points to 3.1% from 3.3% in the same quarter last year, as deposit costs climbed across the sector. Net interest income edged up 3.3% to Rs 42,984 crore, supported by a 12.7% increase in total advances to Rs 44.2 lakh crore.

NEW DELHI: With plans to launch over two dozen new cars in India over the next few years, Hyundai on Tuesday said it is confident of getting back its No 2 position in the domestic market as new models come in and it increases production capacity and offerings in the country, including electrics and hybrids.The company, which has faced stiff competition from local Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors in the recent past, is also ramping up its production to nearly one million cars per annum, as it begins manufacturing from its new plant at Talegaon (in Maharashtra) which it acquired from General Motors. This will place it behind top producer Maruti Suzuki in terms of installed production capacity numbers in India.As it launched the new-gen version of the Venue mini SUV at an entry price of Rs 7.9 lakh (ex-showroom), Tarun Garg – the COO of Hyundai India (who is set to take charge as CEO and MD from January) – said the company remains confident on the outlook and growth potential.“In the domestic market, we are passionate about the No. 2 position. And we will get it back,” Garg told TOI, when asked about the growing competition for the company which recently announced an investment horizon of Rs 45,000 crore by the end of FY30.Garg said while there had been months where some of the competitors had become the No. 2 maker in the domestic market, Hyundai still remained the second-ranked when it came to counting domestic and export sales cumulatively and even in full fiscal or calendar year numbers.“At the same time, we want to have a very strong approach of quality of sales as we grow… we have not joined price wars, we have not joined discount wars, we want to really raise benchmarks in technology. ”With the new Venue, the company is expecting a 20% growth in sales of the model compared to what it does now. The company has made its India factory the sole manufacturing base for the model which will be exported to around 30 countries.Garg said that SUVs will remain the dominant theme in new launches for the company. “The share of SUVs is around 71% now, and we see this going up to 82% by FY30 as we also introduce MPVs.”",The company is ramping up its production to nearly one million cars per annum.

Mumbai: Homegrown private equity (PE) firm ChrysCapital has raised a $2.2 billion fund, the largest ever by a local PE investor to tap into growth opportunities in India even as global fundraising activity has been subdued amid an uncertain macro-environment.The new fund which is more than 60% bigger in size compared to the company's last $1.3 billion fund closed in 2022 saw participation from a clutch of Indian investors for the first time in the firm's 26 years of operations in the country amid a widening pool of domestic capital. Investors from Japan, Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe and the US backed the fund alongside a bunch of local insurance companies, financial institutions and large family offices. ""India is where China was two decades ago. We are on the cusp of a multi-decade growth run. The govt has put in place the physical and digital infrastructure that provides the base for long-term growth,"" Saurabh Chatterjee, MD at ChrysCapital told TOI.The company has acquired majority stakes in Theobroma and Xoriant and made a slew of investments across a mix of traditional and new-age firms including Lenskart, Hero Fincorp and National Stock Exchange (NSE).Unlike its venture capital peers, ChrysCapital does not want to rush into the AI race and place bets on disruptive technologies. The PE firm will stick to its strategy of investing in companies that have acquired significant scale, hold leading market share in the segments they operate, are profitable or close to profitability, and can chart out a clear exit strategy for their investors. ""We look at companies after they have gone through the disruptive, cash burn stage and have evolved as a market leader or are among the top two-three players. That means we will not get a 50x return and that's fine. But we also don't lose money,"" said Chatterjee.A large part of the fund will go towards making investments in traditional companies while 10%-15% of the fund's corpus will be earmarked for backing new-age firms. ChrysCapital will make 15-16 investments through the fund (higher than its usual 11-13 investments trajectory given the fund size) with cheque sizes in the range of $75 million-$200 million. One investment has already been closed and it is in the process of finalising a couple more. The full fund will be deployed in 3-4 years and will largely be used to make new investments across healthcare, manufacturing, new economy, financial services and enterprise technology spaces, said Chatterjee, adding that the deal pipeline is strong. ""The global geopolitical environment is tricky. The fact that we managed to raise this fund which is the largest PE fund ever raised in India by a good margin is a testament to the faith that our investors have shown in us,"" Chatterjee said. Global PE fundraising activity slowed to a decade-low at the end of Sept quarter with annual fundraising value set to be the lowest since 2018 at the current pace, KPMG said in a recent report.","The new fund is more than 60% bigger in size compared to the company's last $1.3 billion fund.

Government suggests to Trai: Consult us before recommendations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-suggests-to-trai-consult-us-before-recommendations/articleshow/125098996.cms,"File photo





NEW DELHI: Digital Communications Commission (DCC)'s ""suggestion"" to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for seeking ""clarifications"" from the department of telecom (DoT) before releasing recommendations on various issues has stirred a controversy with some officials in the agency seeing it as govt intrusion into regulatory turf.On Oct 30, DCC, the inter-ministerial body for policy decisions on telecom, wrote to Trai secretary Atul Kumar Chaudhary suggesting that the regulator could seek DoT's ""clarification on critical aspects"" before releasing its recommendations. It has argued that a ""more proactive exchange of inputs"" can promote ""better alignment of perspectives"" and result in ""swift financial"" recommendations and reduce ""back references"".The law provides for Trai to aid and advise govt on telecom and broadcast matters, while having control over certain issues related to mobile tariffs and telecom interconnect agreements. The letter comes amid divergent views between govt and Trai over the regulator's recommendations on satellite communications spectrum, its pricing and the revenue share arrangement.While DoT did not respond to a questionnaire sent on Monday, an official said ""not much should be read into the note as it is just a suggestion and not binding"".""The intention is just to hasten decision-making on certain important matters, and nothing more,"" the official added.There have been several episodes in the past where the DoT and Trai have not been on the same page and have had their share of differences. Typically, Trai issues recommendations for public consultations and then conducts ""open house"" meetings to get feedback. Govt can also send its input on issues and based on suggestions, Trai sends its recommendations to DoT. Often, the department seeks clarifications from the regulator through ""back references"".In case of other agencies, regulators such as RBI, Sebi and IRDAI issue draft regulations on which public comments are sought and govt too sends its inputs. Based on the consultation process, the final policy or guidelines are worked out.Even in this space, where regulatory independence is well established, there have been several instances where govt got the regulators to either drop the plan or amend it. While the laws empower govt to issue directives to regulators, barring the power sector, there are not many instances of govt invoking the power.","Digital Communications Commission (DCC)'s ""suggestion"" to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for seeking ""clarifications"" from the department of telecom (DoT) has stirred a controversy.

Brand rethink: Yum explores Pizza Hut sale; US slowdown prompts strategic review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/brand-rethink-yum-explores-pizza-hut-sale-us-slowdown-prompts-strategic-review/articleshow/125091917.cms,"



A sharp slowdown in its biggest market has pushed Yum Brands to review its ownership of Pizza Hut, signalling the fast-food giant may be open to selling the struggling pizza chain, AP reported.Chief Executive Officer Chris Turner said the company has begun a formal review of strategic options for Pizza Hut, which remains profitable in several global markets but continues to lose ground in the United States.Pizza Hut operates close to 20,000 restaurants across more than 100 countries, with international sales up 2% in the first nine months of the year. China is its second-largest market after the US. However, in the same period, US sales declined 7%, reflecting the chain’s prolonged struggle to adapt to consumer demand for quick pickup and delivery.“The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut’s performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realise its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum Brands,” Turner said in a statement.He added that the decision aims “to truly take advantage of the brand we’ve built and the opportunities ahead,” as Yum initiates a “thorough review of strategic options.”The company did not set a timeline for completing the review and said no further comments would be made. Shares of Yum Brands rose nearly 7% in morning trading Tuesday.","Pizza Hut operates close to 20,000 restaurants across more than 100 countries, with international sales up 2% in the first nine months of the year.

Wall Street pointed to a weaker open on Tuesday as technology stocks that fuelled early-week gains retreated, with investors scaling back expectations of another Federal Reserve rate cut this year amid persistent inflation concerns.Futures for the S&P 500 slipped 1%, while those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.6%. Nasdaq futures fell the most, tumbling 1.4%, reflecting pressure on high-growth tech names, AP reported.Palantir Technologies led the decline, dropping 7% overnight despite posting third-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates. The data analytics firm has gained 176% so far this year, riding the wave of investor enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. Nvidia also reversed course, shedding 1.7%, while Amazon slipped 1.3% after a sharp rally on Monday following its $38 billion AI computing deal with OpenAI.Analysts have warned that AI-related stocks are showing signs of overvaluation, with comparisons being drawn to the dot-com bubble of 2000. “There’s growing concern that parts of the market, particularly AI-linked firms, have become detached from fundamentals,” a trader said.Adding to the caution, Federal Reserve officials signalled they may hold rates steady longer than expected. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he was “nervous about the inflation side of the ledger,” while Fed Governor Lisa Cook remarked that “every meeting, including December’s, is a live meeting,” suggesting no firm commitment to near-term rate cuts.In other corporate moves, Getty Images slumped 8.2% after a British court ruled largely against it in the first major copyright lawsuit involving generative AI. The company had sued Stability AI over alleged misuse of its image database to train AI models.Tesla shares also fell 2.7% after Norway’s $1.6 trillion sovereign wealth fund — one of the company’s largest investors — said it would vote against CEO Elon Musk’s proposed $1 trillion compensation plan.

Saudi Aramco reported a net profit of $26.9 billion for the third quarter, slightly lower than last year, as subdued global crude prices weighed on earnings even as the company outperformed analyst forecasts.The world’s largest oil producer said total revenue stood at $111 billion in the July–September quarter, down from $123 billion in the same period last year, AP reported. Aramco’s profit for the year-ago quarter was $27.5 billion.“Aramco's ability to adapt to new market realities has once again been demonstrated by our strong third quarter performance,” said President and CEO Amin H. Nasser. “We increased production with minimal incremental cost, and reliably supplied the oil, gas and associated products our customers depend on.”In a filing on the Riyadh-based Tadawul exchange, Aramco - formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co. — reported an adjusted profit of $27.9 billion under IFRS accounting standards.The company’s results came just after OPEC+, a group of oil-producing nations including Russia, announced it would pause previously planned output hikes for early 2026 due to market oversupply concerns. The bloc will, however, add 137,000 barrels a day in December.Benchmark Brent crude prices have hovered around $65 a barrel, near a four-year low, amid concerns of excess supply and slowing demand.Aramco’s steady earnings are vital to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic diversification plan, which includes massive infrastructure projects and preparations for hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.Saudi Arabia’s low production costs — among the cheapest globally — mean the kingdom gains roughly $40 billion in additional revenue for every $10 rise in oil prices, according to the Institute of International Finance.The Saudi government remains the majority shareholder in Aramco, which floated a small portion of its shares in 2019 and is considering additional public offerings.","Saudi Aramco reported a net profit of $26.9 billion for the third quarter, slightly lower than last year.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, one of the largest investors in Tesla, has said it will vote against CEO Elon Musk’s proposed compensation package that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade.The announcement comes ahead of Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, where the plan has become the most divisive agenda item among investors, AP reported.The fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), holds about 1.16% of Tesla’s shares, making it the sixth-largest institutional shareholder. In a statement, NBIM said while it recognises the “significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role,” it remains concerned about “the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation. ”“We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,” the fund added.Tesla’s proposal involves awarding Musk shares equivalent to nearly 12% of the company in 12 separate tranches, contingent upon achieving ambitious performance goals tied to production, operating profit, and stock price milestones. If fully realised, the package could make Musk’s payout one of the largest in corporate history.However, not all major investors are opposed. Baron Capital Management, which holds about 0.4% of Tesla’s outstanding shares, announced support for the plan.“Elon is the ultimate ‘key man’ of key man risk. Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,” said Ron Baron, founder of Baron Capital. “He has built one of the most important companies in the world. He’s redefining transportation, energy and humanoid robotics and creating lasting value for shareholders while doing it. His interests are completely aligned with investors. ”Musk remains Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, holding 15.79% of all outstanding shares.The shareholder vote will determine whether investors endorse Tesla’s management proposal, which has drawn both strong backing and fierce criticism. The outcome will also signal how much confidence shareholders retain in Musk’s leadership amid questions over governance, compensation practices, and the company’s long-term strategy.","Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of the largest investors in Tesla, has said it will vote against CEO Elon Musk’s proposed compensation package that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade.

US backed global gag order shields MNCs: India's tax loss pegged at $24.2 bn over five years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-backed-global-gag-order-shields-mncs-indias-tax-loss-pegged-at-24-2-bn-over-five-years/articleshow/125078970.cms,"AI image





A US-backed global gag order preventing governments from revealing the names of multinational corporations (MNCs) that are found shifting billions into tax havens has caused countries to miss out on over $475 billion in corporate tax from 2016 to 2021, according to a report released today by Tax Justice Network.The biggest loser to the global gag order is the US itself (tax loss of $158.5 billion), followed by France €27.3 billion ( or $32.3 billion); Germany €25.7 billion ( or $30.3 billion) and India Rs 1.805 trillion ( or $24.4 billion). UK with a tax loss of £10.8 billion (or $14.8 billion) and Mexico – MEX$254 billion (or $12.5 billion) follow.Since 2016, multinational companies have had to reveal to government authorities where they earn profits and pay taxes through what’s called country-by-country reporting. This system was meant to expose tax dodging by showing which companies shift profits to tax havens. But corporate lobbying led to the data being anonymised and not open to public scrutiny.As a result, the rule meant to promote transparency has turned into a ‘global gag order,’ states the State of Tax Justice (2025) report.The US has long opposed public disclosure of such data, and its political pushback has encouraged big American companies to resist moves towards transparency in places like Australia and the EU.A key driver of the losses is a dramatic escalation in tax abuse by US multinational corporations set loose by President Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, adds the research.US headquartered MNCs are now shifting twice as much profit out of the countries where they operate in and into the US, but are paying even less tax in the US than they were before Trump’s tax cuts were introduced.They are responsible for 29 per cent of all corporate tax losses suffered yearly by all countries.The EU and Australia began to partially lift the global gag order locally this year despite increasingly aggressive lobbying from US MNCs in particular.In June this year, all countries but the US committed in a UN outcome document to take steps towards lifting the global gag order by evaluating the option of a global public database for the reports in the future.Efforts to adequately tax US MNCs and other multinational corporations will be front and centre this month at a negotiating session in Nairobi where countries will continue work on a world-first United Nations tax convention.Transparency measures to ensure fair access to information are part of the package, and countries can now more ambitiously commit to lift the global gag order fully, ensuring every member state – and their citizens – would benefit.The convention is largely seen as countries’ last resort to push back against the new Trump administration’s sweeping threats and attacks on the tax sovereignty of nations – that is, on the right of a nation to decide who to tax within its borders, how much and what for.Alex Cobham, chief executive at Tax Justice Network said, “The world is at a fork in the road. One path leads to tax subjugation under Trump and US multinationals, while the other leads to a collective defence of tax sovereignty at the UN that protects every country’s taxing rights.”","US-backed global gag order preventing governments from revealing the names of multinational corporations (MNCs) has caused countries to miss out on over $475 billion in corporate tax from 2016 to 2021.

US tariff row: Can US Supreme Court put an end to Trump's tariffs? Officials warn 'they're here to stay',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariff-row-can-us-supreme-court-put-an-end-to-trumps-tariffs-officials-warn-theyre-here-to-stay/articleshow/125074559.cms,"'No tariffs....no national security'



'Tariffs are here to stay' — Even if the court says no





US President Donald Trump's global tariff strategy will be facing a trial in the US Supreme Court on Wednesday, however, they might still be in place even if the Court decides otherwise.Donald Trump, who has announced multiple tariffs and secondary tariffs for a number of countries, will not be attending the high-stakes hearing, though he had earlier expressed a desire to be there. He later stepped back, saying his presence could become the focus.“It's not about me, it's about our country,” he told reporters on Sunday.Instead, in his place, treasury secretary Scott Bessent will be representing administration in the courtroom. Speaking on Fox News Channel’s “Jesse Watters Primetime”, Bessent said, “I’m actually going to go and sit the -- hopefully in the front row and listen -- have a ringside seat.”The Supreme Court is set to determine whether Trump exceeded his authority when he relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose wide-reaching import tariffs. Lower courts had already ruled that Trump did not have the legal power under IEEPA to levy such duties, but allowed the tariffs to stay in place until the Supreme Court delivers its decision.Bessent dismissed concerns that his courtroom appearance might be viewed as an attempt to pressure the justices.“They can say what they want. I am there to emphasize that this is an economic emergency,” he said. He has repeatedly framed the matter as one of national security and noted that backup options exist should the administration lose the case. Last month, he said, “There are lots of other authorities that we can operate under.”“Remember too, we also have numerous trade deals in effect. So I don’t think that countries are going to back out of the trade deals.”The outcome is being closely watched by businesses, foreign trade officials and lawyers, given that the tariffs are likely to remain in some form even if the court restricts the use of IEEPA. Trump's tariffs, introduced at speed and on multiple countries, have reshaped supply chains. Bill Canady, CEO of US factory equipment manufacturer OTC Industrial Technologies, said the shifting tariff landscape has made planning difficult.“We moved things out of China and went to some of those other countries, and now the tariffs on those are as bad or worse,” he told Reuters.'“We just have to hang on and navigate our way through this so we don't all go broke in the short run.”Trump continues to defend the duties as essential for protecting American interests. Speaking aboard Air Force One, he said, “If we don't have tariffs, we don't have national security, and the rest of the world would laugh at us because they've used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us.”“We were subject to being abused by a lot of other countries, including China - for years, not anymore. Tariffs have brought us tremendous national security,” he said.Even if the court rules against the use of IEEPA, Bessent said that Trump could use other tools already available to him. One is Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which allows duties of up to 50% on countries that discriminate against US commerce.“You should assume that they're here to stay,” Bessent said of the tariffs. He also warned countries that have negotiated tariff-lowering trade deals with the Trump administration, “Those of you who got a good deal should stick with it.”The case being argued this week covers only part of the tariffs imposed this year. The administration is already using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs tied to national security on sectors like autos, copper, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, robotics and aircraft, and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to address unfair trade practices.With the court’s 6-3 conservative majority having backed Trump in several major rulings this year, the decision could reaffirm, or redefine, the limits of presidential tariff powers.","US President Donald Trump's global tariff strategy will be facing a trial in the US Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Asian stocks traded mostly in red on Tuesday as investors weighed Wall Street’s tech rally amid concerns of tech bubble formation in the sector. Traders were also remaining cautious as Fed officials gave mixed signals about the next interest rate move.Japan's Nikkei traded in red, down 188 points or 0.36% to reach 52,222 at 9:30, AM IST.Shanghai and Shenzhen, also plunged 0.19% and 1.27%, respectively.South Korean Kospi also slipped 1.62%, to trade at 4,153.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, HSI gained 45 points to reach 26,203.A wave of multi-billion-dollar spending on artificial intelligence has driven a global rally in technology shares this year. Valuations have climbed to record levels, helped by a calmer trade environment following US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement in April and expectations that borrowing costs will continue to fall.However, analysts say the advance is increasingly being powered by a fear of missing out, raising speculation that a sharp correction could follow as gains become concentrated primarily in technology stocks.Adding to the sector’s momentum, ChatGPT-creator OpenAI signed a $38 billion deal with Amazon’s AWS cloud business, the latest in a string of major partnerships that also include Oracle, Broadcom, AMD and Nvidia.On Wall Street, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed higher on Monday, though the Dow fell into negative territory.However, Asia failed to replicate Monday’s momentum. Hong Kong, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta posted gains, while Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul and Taipei slipped. Shanghai was unchanged.Comments from Federal Reserve policymakers added to the cautious mood. Chair Jerome Powell signalled last week that a third rate cut this year was not guaranteed, even after reductions at the past two meetings.Governor Lisa Cook warned that inflation may stay elevated as tariffs filter through the economy, noting that some companies were choosing to clear excess stock rather than immediately pass higher costs on to consumers.Fresh economic data released Monday pointed to more strain in the US economy, with a key manufacturing activity index contracting for the eighth consecutive month in October as demand and output weakened.","Japan's Nikkei traded in red, down 188 points or 0.36% to reach 52,222 at 9:30, AM IST.

Trump, Xi Defuse Tariff Time Bomb? U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse





WASHINGTON: When Neal Katyal walks up to the nine US Supreme Court justices on Wednesday morning, he will be arguing a case that even US President Donald Trump has said is “one of the most important in the History of the Country.” So critical that Trump himself had said he would personally be in the court before deciding not to because “I do not want to distract from the importance of the decision. ”The 54-year old Indian-American attorney is the lead counsel for plaintiffs in the landmark case that will decide whether the U.S President has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), or whether, as Katyal will assert, the power of taxation and tariffs rests with Congress. “It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court. If we win, we will be the Richest, Most Secure Country anywhere in the World, BY FAR. If we lose, our Country could be reduced to almost Third World status — Pray to God that that doesn’t happen!” Trump said on Sunday.On his part, Katyal will pray before the court that it uphold the decision he won before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ,where he represented the Liberty Justice Center to secure a 7-4 ruling that said the President lacked the authority to impose sweeping tariffs.Indicative of the importance of the case, the arguments before the SC are scheduled to last for an extended period of 80 minutes, which is longer than the standard 60 minutes for cases. The courtroom is expected to be packed, with the eyes of not just Americans but the entire world glued to the proceedings.Katyal is not new to the limelight. A celebrated attorney who has argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court, going back to 2000 when he was co-counsel for vice-president Al Gore in the Bush v Gore case, he is a familiar figure in American legal circles, and in the eyes of many, a “Trump tormentor.” From challenging the Trump administration's travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries during its first term to arguing against the White House's efforts to expedite deportation efforts, he has been a thorn in the administration’s side, lacing his record in courts with trenchant commentaries on MSNBC.Son of a physician mom and engineer dad who emigrated from India, the Chicago-born Katyal attended Yale Law School, where he was mentored by Akhil Amar, an Indian-American US Constitutional Law legend. While Neal's sister Sonia Katyal is a Professor of Law and co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology at UC Berkeley, Akhil Amar's brother Vikram Amar was the Dean of University of Illinois College of Law and is currently a Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California law school.In fact, the tariff case against Trump also involves another Indian-American attorney, Pratik Shah, who is head of Akin Gump's Supreme Court and Appellate practice, and was the lead counsel Learning Resources and hand2mind, two educational toy companies that have also challenged the presidential authority under IEEPA. The Supreme Court consolidated all the cases for Wednesday’s hearing, and according to the SCOTUS blog, Katyal won the right to make the arguments after a coin toss.",Indian-American attorney Neal Katyal is the lead counsel for plaintiffs in the landmark case. The case will decide whether the U.S President has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Trump himself had said he would personally be in the court before deciding not to because “I do not want to distract from the importance of the decision. ”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125064006,imgsize-685018,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The art of misdeal: How Donald Trump’s China tariff backfired on US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-tariff-on-china-xi-jinping-us-china-trade-deal-trump-tariff-war/articleshow/125061271.cms,"Trump, Xi Defuse Tariff Time Bomb? U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse

Why it matters

The core goal of Trump’s trade agenda - to weaken China’s manufacturing clout and revive US industry - is increasingly out of reach. His chaotic tariff strategy is backfiring, driving small companies back into China’s arms and reinforcing the very dependency he promised to end.

“I’m not going to spend any more energy trying to get out of China,” Travis McMaster, a Washington-based importer who was forced to abandon plans to shift production to India after Trump raised tariffs there, told the New York Times.

Instead of creating incentives to diversify, Trump’s tariff flip-flops are eroding trust in the US as a stable economic partner. Meanwhile, China is playing a longer game - and winning.

Between the lines

The big picture

1. China has mastered Trump’s playbook.

2. Rare earths are Beijing’s ace.

3. Trump’s allies are getting punished.

Zoom in: America’s broken tariff math

Average Trump-era tariff on Chinese goods: 47.6%

Tariffs on India & Brazil: Up to 50%

Tariff on Canada (fentanyl-related): 35%

China's fentanyl tariff: Cut to 10%

The numbers

$1bn/day: China’s current rate of exports to the US, despite tariffs

25M tons: China’s new annual soybean commitment under the deal - still less than pre-trade war levels

34%: Rise in China’s stock market this year, compared to ~17% for the S&P 500

3x: US reliance on Chinese inputs vs China’s on American ones, according to economist Richard Baldwin

How China is winning

What they’re saying

“Ten percent isn’t quite enough to move the needle,” said Cameron Johnson, a Shanghai-based supply chain expert. “You’re not going to move your factory or production for six months and a 10% reduction.”(NYT)

“China is playing chess while the US plays tic-tac-toe,” said a person close to the negotiations.(AP)

“They’ve shown themselves to be an unreliable partner... and they have the sword over us,” Bessent said.(CNN)

“They are sending a message that it’s time for payback,” said Sean Stein, referring to China’s rare-earth licensing scheme. (Economist)

What’s next

The bottom line

Trump's tariff policy, framed as a crusade to “decouple” from China, has produced a paradox: it’s tying US supply chains more tightly to Beijing, not less.

It has empowered China to weaponize rare earths, rewrite global trade norms, and test American resolve - all while appearing cooperative on paper.

And for American workers, farmers, and manufacturers - the collateral damage continues to pile up.

Trump claimed the trade war would be a “big win” for American manufacturing. But by almost every measure, China is stronger now than when he started.

Trump may have won headlines. Xi won leverage.





US President Donald Trump’s latest “deal” with China is doing more for Beijing than it is for Washington. In a bid to de-escalate a spiraling trade war, Trump agreed to halve a 20% fentanyl-related tariff and delay major sanctions on Chinese firms - while simultaneously raising tariffs on allies like Canada.The effect: China is walking away with cheaper access to US markets, looser restrictions on rare-earth exports, and less pressure to overhaul its manufacturing dominance - while American businesses and workers pay the price.Despite fiery rhetoric, Trump’s actions tell a different story.•Chinese goods now face lower or similar tariffs compared to imports from key US allies.•Beijing’s rare-earth chokehold remains intact, even as Trump touts “deals” to ease export restrictions.•The promise to decouple has, in practice, slowed: American businesses are hedging less, not more.“Contrary to what many in the administration are saying, they haven’t ended up with a tariff structure that really encourages relocation out of China,” Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations told the NYT.In fact, as Sean Stein of the US-China Business Council puts it, the deal has only reaffirmed China’s place as the world’s factory: “In no place has it been possible to replicate the manufacturing ecosystem and cost efficiencies that you get in China.”This is not just about tariffs. It's about who sets the rules of global trade - and right now, China is taking control.From soybeans to semiconductors, Beijing has learned how to retaliate with precision.“We just won’t tolerate the US hitting us anymore, and we believe we have the capability to fight back,” Tu Xinquan, a Beijing trade expert, told the Economist.•When Trump threatened Chinese shipping with 100% tariffs, China imposed port fees of its own.•When the US sanctioned Chinese chipmakers, Beijing launched sweeping antitrust probes into Nvidia, Qualcomm, and others.•And when Trump leaned on tariffs to force fentanyl concessions, China offered limited cooperation in exchange for massive tariff relief.China controls over 85% of the world’s refined rare earths - vital for everything from smartphones to fighter jets. Its recent licensing regime allows it to decide who can make what and where.Trump backed down from a 100% tariff after Beijing signaled it would stop shipments entirely - potentially paralyzing American auto and tech industries.Trump imposed higher tariffs on Indian and Brazilian goods than on Chinese ones.Even Canada, America's closest ally, is facing a 35% nominal tariff - higher than China’s 10% fentanyl rate. Switzerland? Hit with 39%, mostly over gold imports. Meanwhile, China got relief in return for vague promises to buy soybeans and slow fentanyl exports.Even Britain and Australia - longtime US allies - are now hit with a 10% “reciprocal” tariff.This mishmash of penalties has created economic uncertainty that punishes friends more than foes and does little to reduce America's $300 billion trade deficit with China.President Xi Jinping has shown China can resist American coercion while answering in ways that deter escalation. China’s targeted responses-from export restrictions on critical inputs to countermeasures on shipping-have exposed the limits of sweeping US embargo threats that would also harm the American economy.Through trial and error, China is assembling a new framework for global trade that competes with tariff-centric strategies. It has redirected exports toward non-US markets while tightening control over chokepoint industries such as rare earths, using licensing-style leverage reminiscent of America’s semiconductor oversight-but sharper. As the largest trading partner for dozens of countries, China is using its manufacturing depth and market reach to set de facto rules that others must navigate, a report in the Economist said.Rather than weakening the leadership, the trade war has galvanized support for Xi Jinping ’s push to insulate critical supply chains and accelerate advanced manufacturing. Despite formidable internal challenges-from property-sector strain to subdued consumption-the confrontation has validated a long-running plan to become a techno-industrial powerhouse, the Economist report said.The tariff ceasefire is temporary. The rare-earth reprieve is for one year. Trump has hinted he’ll reimpose tariffs or add software export bans if China doesn't “keep its promises.”Trump is also expected to meet with Xi Jinping in China early next year. Analysts warn that without a durable framework, the trade rollercoaster could lurch into another round of escalation.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump’s latest “deal” with China is doing more for Beijing than it is for Washington.

Gold stayed close to the $4,000-an-ounce mark on Monday, recovering from early losses after China moved to limit a tax rebate that has long benefited the country’s retailers and jewellery makers.The metal initially slipped by as much as 1% in Asian trading, but later regained ground, with bullion for immediate delivery up 0.2%, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, spot gold was trading near $4,012 an ounce in London at 8:27 a.m.The recovery comes after Beijing revealed on Saturday that it would stop allowing certain retailers to fully offset the value-added tax (VAT) on gold sourced from the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) and the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE).The announcement triggered a swift market reaction, especially in Hong Kong and mainland China, where jewellery counters bore the brunt.Under the new rules, producers of non-investment gold, items used in jewellery or industries such as electronics, can now deduct only 6% of VAT instead of the previous 13%. Businesses that aren’t members of the SGE or SHFE will face the same limits when selling investment-grade gold, including bars.The change quickly led to a rout in jewellery stocks. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. slid as much as 12% in Hong Kong, Chow Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd. fell more than 8%, and Laopu Gold Co. lost more than 9%.Analysts at Citigroup Inc., including Tiffany Feng, noted that the adjustment is “likely to see the entire industry raise prices to pass through the cost pressure,” according to Bloomberg.Despite the turbulence, investor appetite for the metal remains strong. Gold touched an all-time high in October after a burst of retail buying, and although it has since eased, prices are still more than 50% higher since the start of the year. Core factors that have powered the rally — including buying by central banks and safe-haven inflows — remain present.“The tax changes in gold’s heaviest consumer nation will dent global sentiment,” said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault. However, he added that the recovery seen in London trading on Monday, following weakness earlier in Asia, indicates that bullish sentiment towards gold is still firm.Elsewhere in the precious metals market, platinum climbed as much as 2.2%, while silver and palladium also posted small gains.","Spot gold was trading near $4,012 an ounce in London at 8:27 a.m. The recovery comes after Beijing revealed on Saturday that it would stop allowing certain retailers to fully offset the value-added tax (VAT) on gold sourced from the Shanghai Gold Exchange.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125052495,imgsize-77120,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Rare earth dispute that sparked the standoff





US treasury secretary Scott Bessent once again criticised China’s rare earth export controls, saying the United States and its allies are now moving at “warp speed” to build independent supply chains and reduce reliance on Beijing.Speaking to CNN, Bessent said that China’s strategy had been in motion for decades and accused the previous US governments of failing to respond in time.“I think it's naive for the Wall Street Journal editorial board, who I call a bunch of grumpy old men, to think that the Chinese weren't going to roll out these rare earth restrictions. They've been putting this plan together for 25, 30 years, and the US has been asleep at the switch,” he said.He stressed that the Biden administration is accelerating efforts to counter China’s leverage.“And now this administration, we're going to go at warp speed over the next 1-2 years, and we're going to get out from under the this sword that the Chinese have over us, and they have it over the whole world. And this time, we have rallied the allies.”He further added that now countries are going to reduce their reliance on Chinese rare earths.“And so it is going to be a all the Western democracies, the Asian democracies, and India are also going to join us in this, in trying to form our own supply chains. We don't want to decouple from China, but we need to de risk they've shown themselves to be an unreliable partner in many areas.”In October, China introduced new export restrictions on rare earths, minerals crucial for defence systems, electric vehicles and consumer electronics.The move triggered immediate alarm in Washington and among global manufacturers, with access to these materials seen as critical to national security and advanced technology supply chains.Bessent had earlier described the decision as a strategic error by Beijing. In comments published by the Financial Times, he said China’s action sent a warning signal to governments worldwide, “China has alerted everyone to the danger. They’ve made a real mistake.”Referring to the impact of Beijing’s move on trade and supply chains, he added, “It's one thing to put the gun on the table. It's another thing to fire shots in the air.”The restrictions briefly slowed shipments and unsettled rare-earth–dependent industries, emerging as a new flashpoint in US–China trade relations.Now, China has agreed to pause some of its export restrictions after high-level talks between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea this week. Beijing announced that it would suspend certain export limits, including those involving rare-earth materials, for one year.According to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, the recent episode may discourage China from taking similar action again.Bessent added that China may not have anticipated the scale of the reaction triggered by its export limits.“I think the Chinese leadership were slightly alarmed by the global backlash to their export controls,” Bessent said.",US treasury secretary Scott Bessent once again criticised China’s rare earth export controls.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

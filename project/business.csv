Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should look to increase the income tax threshold for the 30% tax bracket in her Union Budget 2025, says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.According to BankBazaar, three important income tax changes that need to be brought in Budget 2025 are; raising the 30% income tax threshold to Rs 18 lakh, restructuring tax brackets, and implementing a standardised 30% deduction on gross income.""The 30% tax slab has remained at ₹15 lakh since 2020, despite a 21% rise in the Cost Inflation Index,"" Shetty notes. ""We propose increasing this threshold to ₹18 lakh to reflect inflation and offer relief to urban salaried individuals burdened by rising costs."" This modification would help distribute the tax responsibility more equitably amongst higher-income earners.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Make NPS more attractive - here's how Shetty expresses concerns about solely increasing the tax-free income limit. ""Calls to raise tax-free income to ₹10 lakh are well-intentioned but shift the tax burden to higher earners. Bracket enhancements should be secular, ensuring fairness across all income levels,"" he explains. ""As per the AY2023-24 figures, just 2% of taxpayers contributed 77% of income tax. A balanced approach is necessary.""Regarding diminishing long-term savings and insurance adoption, Shetty observes, ""The absence of deductions in the new tax regime has led to reduced interest in essential financial protections. Life insurance penetration is dropping, and ELSS inflows are falling despite strong equity performance.""Also Read | Budget 2025: Reduce income tax rates, exceptionally high compared to other countries, says Assocham He adds, ""Fewer salaried individuals are engaging with small savings schemes, and interest in NPS remains low. These trends are concerning, especially amidst an economic slowdown, declining household savings, and stagnant incomes. The incentive to save and to insure—tax deductions—must continue.""Shetty advocates for a 30% flat deduction on gross income with a ₹15 lakh ceiling on deductions.

Govt may also top it up with a 3-4% contribution of the deposit made by the platform.Social security for gig workers , which does not just include food delivery and car ride apps but also software and other professionals, was part of the labour codes enacted a few years ago, which have not been implemented so far as all the states are not on board.Since a number of gig workers work on multiple platforms, at times undertaking different jobs, it may be easier for the entities making the payment to deduct the prescribed amount and deposit it with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation.""We are working out the details and we hope to operationalise it soon,"" a senior labour ministry official told TOI, adding that the Centre is also working with states to get the labour codes moving as they are seen to be crucial for businesses.The Social Security Code has provided for setting up a social security fund and also provides health and accident insurance along with other benefits. A few months ago, labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya had indicated that social security for gig workers may precede the implementation of the labour codes.The ministry has set up a panel under a senior officer and it is looking at the way the scheme will be implemented, with the idea being that the money should be available as a retirement saving for the subscriber, who can then use it once she or he stops working, sources familiar with the discussions told TOI.Providing social security to gig workers is a key aspect of govt's agenda in the coming weeks as several surveys have shown that there is inadequate protection. In fact, the labour ministry was in talks with platforms to ensure that benefits of existing schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and accident and life insurance are made available.Some states have also announced provisions to ensure social security of gig workers.",The platforms will be asked to deduct a certain percentage of the payment they make to these workers and deposit it with the Employees' Pension Scheme.

Govt set to meet fiscal deficit target for FY25 as capex lags: Economists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-set-to-meet-fiscal-deficit-target-for-fy25-as-capex-lags-economists/articleshow/117502319.cms,"Image used for representational purpose only

MUMBAI: Govt will likely exceed its fiscal deficit consolidation target in FY25 due to reduced capital expenditure (capex). For FY26, the target is expected to be supported by a substantial dividend from RBI.""Govt will likely outperform its FY25 fiscal consolidation target, closing the year at 4.8% of GDP versus the budgeted 4.9%, driven by weaker-than-budgeted public capex due to slower approvals in an election year,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, economist at HSBC. Bhandari added that achieving the FY26 target of ""below 4.5% of GDP"" will require cuts in current expenditure, such as subsidies and centrally sponsored schemes, which may be challenging amid weak growth.FM Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Budget for FY26 on Feb 1. While slower growth will impact tax collections, govt has not spent all that it has budgeted for.Aastha Gudwani, chief economist at Barclays, expects the FY2024-25 fiscal deficit to come in below the target and anticipates the FY2025-26 target to be set at 4.5% of GDP. ""The key ask is to support growth while adhering to fiscal consolidation. We expect the government to overachieve the FY2024-25 fiscal deficit target by 20 basis points at 4.7% of GDP,"" said Gudwani.Sonal Varma, chief economist at Nomura, projects the FY25 deficit at 4.8% of GDP, supported by lower capex, and expects the FY26 target to be pegged at 4.4%. CareEdge Ratings also forecasts a fiscal deficit of 4.8% for FY25, with the FY26 target at 4.5%, which is aligned with the medium-term fiscal roadmap.Additionally, borrowing for FY26 may decline, aided by a record RBI dividend, estimated between Rs 1.5-2 lakh crore. Gains from RBI's forex interventions and interest from repo lending are expected to bolster its profits.""RBI's forex reserves peaked at $705 billion in mid-Sept when the rupee was 83.6 against the dollar. RBI has sold a large amount after the rupee crossed the 85/$ mark. Even if the gain is only Rs 2 on every dollar sold, given the size of the intervention, the central bank would have record profits,"" said a dealer. The earnings would be further enhanced by the interest earned by RBI from lending to banks through repo in the money markets.","Govt will likely exceed its fiscal deficit consolidation target in FY25 due to reduced capital expenditure.

The announcement is expected in Budget.The commerce department has already held discussions with the finance ministry on ensuring that there is adequate credit flow and availability of other instruments, such as factoring and credit guarantee for exporters, who have been complaining about these being a big drag on their competitiveness.In fact, the department had roped in a consulting firm to look at the issues in detail and based on the recommendations, it was asked by North Block to reassess some of the recommendations.One of the options being looked at for exporters and MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) alike is collateral free lending to help them tackle the problem of providing security to banks to raise debt. Often small businesses, many of which are family-owned enterprises with little distinction between the personal and business assets, find it difficult to get capital. Exporters have complained that the actual loan flow has been hit hard by banks, which insist on collaterals.In fact, post Covid-19, the guarantee-based loans extended by banks were seen as a huge help for businesses access capital at reasonable rates, while banks lent freely without fearing about large bad debt.For exporters, the interest equalisation scheme, which has been pending with the finance ministry for months, may also get the green light, helping Indian traders compete favourably in the international market as high interest burden and logistics costs are seen to be two major handicaps, when it comes to competing with rivals from the region.Govt believes that small businesses and exporters, particularly those related to manufacturing, can be large employment generators and provide the boost to overall economic activity. The idea is to help them overcome the challenges that they are facing and finance is a key one.According to the latest RBI data, in the current financial year, loans to micro and small enterprises have grown 4.3%, while those to medium-sized businesses were up 12%. Overall credit growth is to the tune of 6.6%.","Govt may announce a package of measures to boost financial support, including credit, to exporters and small businesses.

"IT attrition inches up, signals demand pick-up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-attrition-inches-up-signals-demand-pick-up/articleshow/117502859.cms,"BENGALURU: Some Indian IT firms have shown an uptick in attrition rates, signalling a moderate pickup in the demand environment and opportunities opening up for specialised roles.HCLTech's attrition rate inched up to 13.2% from 12.9% in the previous quarter and 12.8% in the year-ago period. ""Our attrition stands at 13.2% on an LTM basis, slightly higher compared to the previous quarter, which is a natural consequence of the demand pickup,"" its CEO C Vijayakumar said during the earnings call.The company's HR head, Ramachandran Sundararajan, said that the attrition rate would stabilise and conclude FY25 at 13.2%. HCL added 2,134 employees in the Dec quarter, taking the total headcount to 220,755.Among these firms, Wipro records the highest attrition at 15.3%, showing an increase from 14.1% in the first quarter. Nevertheless, the company's leadership indicates that new resignations are decreasing and expects the attrition rate to decline. TCS saw an increase in attrition to 13% in the December quarter from 12.1% in the June quarter. Infosys also witnessed a rise, with rates climbing from 12.7% at the year's outset to 13.7% at the current level.Quess Corp IT staffing CEO, Kapil Joshi, says the spike in attrition is due to demand reviving in retail, manufacturing, and the BFSI. ""Attrition is expected to stabilise at 12-13% by FY26 as the sector adjusts to moderated demand and implements optimised workforce strategies,"" Joshi estimates.Experis' president, Sanju Ballurkar, indicates that whilst current attrition rates are rising, they remain lower than the 20% witnessed during the pandemic period, primarily due to increased demand for AI-related expertise. Industry analysts suggest that global capability centres' competitive recruitment practices have influenced these patterns. NLB Services' CEO, Sachin Alug, suggests that IT services organisations need to match GCCs' career advancement opportunities to regain their competitive position. The Dec quarter saw headcount decline, with three of five IT firms reporting decreased numbers. The top five Indian IT companies recorded a collective reduction of 2,587 personnel, contrary to the Sept quarter's addition of 15,033 staff.","HCLTech's attrition rate inched up to 13.2% from 12.9% in the previous quarter.

Inclusive growth pillar of economic blueprint: Ashwini Vaishnaw,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/inclusive-growth-pillar-of-economic-blueprint-ashwini-vaishnaw/articleshow/117502836.cms,"DAVOS: India will comfortably maintain a 6-8% economic growth rate while keeping inflation under check in the years to come, senior Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Thursday.He also said that simplification of tariffs and customs laws is among key focus areas for his govt to boost exports. Speaking at a session during the World Economic Forum annual meeting here, the minister said inclusive growth remains a key pillar of the country's economic blueprint, alongside continued focus on manufacturing, services and simplification of laws.Inclusive growth has been a key reason for Prime Minister Narendra Modi coming back for a third term as he ensured that the benefits of the economic growth reached every section of society, the minister for railways, information and broadcasting, and electronics and information technology said. Vaishnaw said the talent available in India is unmatched across sectors and the world today trusts India because of its policies. Companies are shifting their factories and value chains to India, he added.Speaking at the same session, industrialist Sanjiv Bajaj said India has a govt that delivers on promises it makes to the industry. India has become a world leader in many sectors, including in new-age areas like drones, he added. But, a growth rate of 6-6.5% is not good enough for a country as big as India, and it needs growth of at least 7-7.5%, he said.","India will comfortably maintain a 6-8% economic growth rate while keeping inflation under check in the years to come, senior Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.

Stock market recommendations : According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Bajaj Finserv , Muthoot Finance , and ABDL are the top stock picks for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for January 23, 2025:Pressure on Nifty eased out in the last hour of trade after it failed to break its previous day’s low despite a selloff in the broader market. After closing at seven month low on Tuesday - Nifty has shown exhaustion of sellers near the 23k mark and a range bound trade between 23000 – 23300 can be seen for the rest of this week. A huge medium term support is being developed near 22800 – 22650 wherein a five year upward trendline support has emerged on weekly charts.Index recovered close to 700 points from its intraday lows as an index heavyweight reported better than expected numbers. Trading above 48850 on spot levels would negate the short term bearish flag formation on hourly charts of Bank Nifty. Support has now got developed at 48000 levels on the index while a round of short covering could be seen above 48850 for 500-700 point upside.An unusual buying interest is seen in Bajaj Finserv from the start of this calendar year wherein the stock is up 11% so far in a matter of 3 weeks compared to a 2-4% downtick on Nifty and Bank Nifty. Bajaj Finserv has claimed a 10 week high closing on Wednesday along with a bullish flag breakout on daily charts. This can allow the ongoing inflow momentum to continue for another 5-7% upside.Another stock exhibiting relative strength to the peer group and overall market is less than 5% away to reclaim its all-time highs. A fresh bullish flag breakout is seen on daily charts of the scrip which now opens doors to fresh all time high on charts. Given the tailwind expected in this sector ahead of the budget due next week, charts suggest a reclamation of new all-time high in the next 8-10 trading days.Stock has been outperforming broader markets as well as its peers for the past 8 weeks now, with Nifty and broader indices remaining at the same level seen in end of November 2024, the stock has seen a rise of +25% from its level seen in end of November 2024 signifying its relative strength to peer group and overall market. Currently just below 385 odd levels, the stock has taken support multiple times in the past 4-5 weeks now and the same is likely to hold going forward. A quick 8-10% reversal rally cannot be ruled out from this set up on charts.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Bajaj Finserv, Muthoot Finance, and ABDL are the top stock picks for today.

Laken Riley Act: House passes Laken Riley Act in move targeting illegal immigrants – Trump set to sign marking first major act of second term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/house-passes-laken-riley-act-targeting-immigrant-detention-set-to-become-trumps-first-signed-bill-in-second-term/articleshow/117471010.cms,"Representative image

The House of Representatives, under Republican leadership, approved the Laken Riley Act on Wednesday, a stringent immigration detention law named after a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in the previous year.The bill, which focuses on detaining individuals illegally present in the US who commit nonviolent offences such as theft, is set to become the first legislation President Donald Trump will sign upon his return to the White House this week.The legislation passed with a 263-156 vote, gaining support from 46 Democrats alongside all Republican members. Earlier in the week, the Senate approved it 64-35, with 12 Democrats voting in favour, including Sens. Gary Peters, Jon Ossoff, Jeanne Shaheen, and Mark Warner, who face re-election in 2026.In November, Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old Venezuelan citizen who was in the United States illegally, was found guilty of kidnapping, assaulting, and murdering Riley while she was jogging near the University of Georgia campus in Athens. Ibarra received a life sentence without the possibility of parole.During the 2024 campaign, Trump and Republicans emphasised that Ibarra had been cited for shoplifting by a Georgia police department, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not issue a detainer for him, and he was not taken into custody.The Laken Riley Act, authored by Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.), would require ICE to take custody of and detain undocumented immigrants who are charged, arrested, or convicted of committing acts of ""burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.""""It's bittersweet,"" Collins said after the vote, adding that he had spoken to Riley's family earlier in the day. ""For a young lady that wanted to dedicate her career and her life to saving lives, now her name will live on forever and it will save lives.""Last year, the GOP-controlled House passed an earlier version of the bill with a vote of 264-159, including support from 48 Democrats. However, the Democratic-led Senate ignored the bill, and President Joe Biden never indicated whether he supported it.The Senate adopted two amendments to expand the list of acts that trigger mandatory detention of unauthorized migrants: one from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) that includes assault of a police officer, and another from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) that includes acts causing death or bodily harm to an individual.The passage of the Laken Riley Act occurs amidst a heated debate among Democrats about how to address immigration issues following their significant defeat in the 2024 election and how to respond to Trump's plans for mass deportation.Pro-immigration activists have criticized the bill as a scheme to strip away due process for migrants and disrupt the system, while some Democrats have called it an unfunded mandate that will cost billions. Other Democrats in competitive districts and states supported the bill, seeking to demonstrate their commitment to strict immigration enforcement.According to NBC News exit polls, immigration was the fourth-biggest concern among voters in the 2024 election, with those Americans voting for Trump over Democratic rival Kamala Harris by a margin of 89% to 9%. Trump also made significant gains among Latino voters and won Latino men outright, according to exit polls.House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) addressed the divide within the party over the bill, stating, ""Members will vote their districts. Members have to balance ... their love for this country with the job that they have to do for their constituents. We expect them to do both in the votes that they make.""""The Democratic Caucus believes in a safe and secure border,"" Aguilar continued. ""We believe in order at the border and a fix to our broken immigration system. We also believe in ensuring the public safety of our communities.""Democrats who opposed the Laken Riley Act argued that the legislation was too draconian. Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), the new chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told NBC News, ""Laken Riley casts out a net to cuff, arrest and deport people who have committed minor offenses. In that sense, it is not a good thing."" ""Any discussion that should be had here around the issue of border security, around the issue of immigration,"" he said, ""should include something on Dreamers, farm workers and families.""In an interview with NBC News, Laken Riley's father, Jason Riley, expressed gratitude for the lawmakers who supported the legislation, which he believed has ""helped change things politically.""""I think it turned out to be a good thing,"" he said Wednesday. He added that he hates that her killing ""became such a national story"" and put the family in the spotlight, but that he understood ""why it became so politically charged.""""We're very happy with the way things have turned out,"" he said.","The Laken Riley Act is a stringent immigration detention law named after a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in the previous year.

After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines. The recent launch of a spectacularly successful meme coin helped SOL reach its all-time high yet again. Speculators predict further growth, but several challengers are rising fast.For one, a new TON-based token has the potential to rival this success. Thanks to its significant utility and systemic importance, this token could be a top performer this cycle.After a major rally at the start of the bull market, Solana (SOL) is once again in the headlines. The “Ethereum killer” has attained new highs thanks to a major memecoin launch. Namely, just days before his inauguration, President Donald Trump launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) token. The token quickly attained a staggering valuation of $10 billion, making Trump one of the richest men alive.The token’s launch on Solana has created a market frenzy, pushing Solana to its new ATH at $290. Despite the subsequent volatility, Solana is still up 42% over the past seven days, trading at $254. Now, experts predict that the token can go even higher.The launch of Trump and Melania tokens on the network will likely boost its credibility. At the same time, Trump’s favourable stance toward crypto may prove to be even more consequential. If Solana cements its position as the meme coin hub, it has further potential to expand.Despite Solana’s significant growth, it is not without its challenges. Among them is TON , another high-performance blockchain with several aces up its sleeve. For one, TON has a deep connection with the Telegram messaging app.Telegram provides TON with access to its 950 million users. At the same time, it also enables real-world applications for the network. For one, TON-based apps are becoming more popular on Telegram. For example, popular clicker apps like Notcoin drew significant engagement.TON is also expanding into several new areas. Just in time for the next meme coin rally, TON has revealed a major partnership. Ethereum-based GraFun memecoin launchpad has recently joined the TON platform. This platform will enable the easy creation of meme coins on TON, just as Pump.fun did for Solana.Thanks to these developments, TON emerges as a potential Solana challenger. Moreover, the recent launch of Elluminex (ELX) could further boost its potential. The project aims to be the main trading hub for TON, injecting much-needed liquidity into the chain.Elluminex works as a DEX with cross-chain bridges to 40 major blockchains. This way, it helps bring together liquidity across major chains. This is crucial, as the introduction of major DEXs has had a significant impact on token prices.For instance, since the launch of Raydium, Solana grew from $1.5 to more than $200 in a single year. Ethereum saw similar effects after the launch of Uniswap, as did BNB with PancakeSwap. These examples showcase the importance of liquidity for the chains.Elluminex will also enable low-slippage trading with self-custody, appealing both to large traders and retail players. Thanks to the fact that the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to more than rival Solana’s performance.","After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines.

With a startling $190 trillion worth, the global payments sector is about to undergo a significant change as one viral altcoin is causing waves. The promising project Remittix ( RTX ), which combines blockchain technology with local payment networks, is addressing ongoing cross-border problems like sluggish processing times and excessive costs.But should Cardano (ADA) exhibit indications of a possible recovery, could this fresh rival challenge other top crypto coins and flip ADA's position? Remittix might be the crypto initiative that changes our perspective on cross-border transactions this year. Read on to find out why RTX has the potential to surpass ADA.Rising momentum makes Cardano (ADA) among the top altcoins to keep an eye on this year. Though there were occasional swings, the Cardano price increased more than 16% during the past week, showing a bullish momentum.

But a brief bearish breakout saw the altcoin drop to $0.98 before rebounding with great positive momentum, moving it to the $1.09 resistance zone.The Cardano price has been steadily rising over the previous month, rising by more than 16% and keeping a good view among the crypto community. Though it still stands over 65% behind its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10, hope regarding a possible ATH retest in 2025 keeps rising. Reflecting a good blend of stability and growth, Cardano (ADA) noted green days in 53% of the last 30 days.Cardano (ADA) is still among the promising altcoins to watch given its strong fundamentals and bullish investor sentiment. Reiterating the positive sentiment shown on the Cardano price chart, indicators including the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages flash buy signals However, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) currently shows sale signals, indicating a possible pullback. Looking forward, analysts are bullish on Cardano (ADA) in 2025. A recent 2025 Cardano price prediction forecasts that the altcoin could trade in a price channel between $1 and $5 on average this year.Remittix is emerging as a promising project at a time when cross-border transactions are sometimes hampered by hefty fees and delayed processing periods. Moreover, Remittix provides a more affordable, efficient means for individuals and companies to transmit money all around the world by merging local payment systems with blockchain technology, therefore bridging cryptocurrencies and traditional banks.The desire for creative ideas like Remittix has never been stronger since the worldwide remittance market exceeds $750 billion yearly.

Remittix has addressed one of the most enduring issues in global payments by supporting more than forty cryptocurrencies and giving users the option to convert them to fiat and forward them to any bank account anywhere in the world.Remittix is well suited to profit from the rising need for quick, safe, competitively cost cross-border payment solutions. Investors are quite interested in the platform since its presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 252 million RTX tokens in a few weeks. Early buyers have a unique chance to join the presale at a shockingly low price of just $0.0256 per RTX token before the expected launch on tier-1 exchanges in the coming weeks.Remittix (RTX) is fast establishing itself as a game-changer in cross-border payments as the competition for dominance in the crypto arena gets more intense. Moreover, Remittix promises faster, less expensive, and more transparent solutions than conventional banking systems.Additionally, Remittix is a project worth investing in given an increasing presale success and a great chance to take a sizable portion of the $750 billion remittance market. Even though Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting indications of recovery, it is evident that the massive investor demand for the limited RTX token supply is poised to result in exponential gains shortly.Join the Remittix (RTX) presale and community:","Remittix (RTX) is transforming cross-border transactions.

Trump threatens Brics nations with 100% tariffs if they try replacing US dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-threatens-brics-nations-with-100-tariffs-if-they-try-replacing-us-dollar/articleshow/117425991.cms,"US President Donald Trump has once again threatened Brics nations, including India, of imposing 100% tariffs on trade in case the bloc moves forward with plans to replace the US dollar.In his speech after assuming office as the 47th US president on Monday, Trump made it clear that any attempt by Brics nations to move away from the dollar would not be tolerated.""If the Brics nations want to do that, that's okay, but we're going to put at least a 100% tariff on the business they do with the United States,"" Trump said, emphasising that any such actions would result in severe penalties.He further asserted that the countries would have to face hefty tariffs even if they even considered reducing the dollar’s role in global trade.Brics, an intergovernmental organisation consisting of ten countries: Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates, has been at the centre of global economic discussions.Trump had warned the group previously in December too, against attempts to replace the dollar with a new currency.""We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new Brics currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar or, they will face 100 per cent tariffs and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy,"" Trump said at the time.Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar further affirmed India’s stance regarding the replacement of dollar, stating that the country has never supported de-dollarisation and there were no plans for a Brics currency.On a different note, Trump also addressed questions on immigration. He expressed his support for legal immigration, stating that the country would need more workers to support manufacturing growth due to his tariff policies.""I'm fine with legal immigration.

Time to speak openly and plainly

Global Shapers

and decisions about the future

Looking for solutions and social accountability

The protest is small but loud. As limousines drive past, a few hundred young people have gathered on the Postplatz square in Davos, Switzerland.The high-altitude resort in the Alps that usually belongs to skiers looks different this week. Bakeries, cafes, and boutiques have been converted to host banks, companies, or whole countries for the next few days.A pub is now called ""Belgium House."" The old furniture has been cleared out and chic designer furniture and large advertising posters have been put in their place.The demonstrators outside shout ""Eat the rich"" and ""Tax the rich."" Some of them block the street. Their protest is directed at the participants of the World Economic Forum (WEF). They see the meeting, which runs from January 20-24, as a complete waste of money and time.""We are protesting against the lobby meeting of the rich and powerful in Davos. It is clear that they are the ones responsible for the current crises,"" says Mirjam Hostetmann from the youth organization Young Socialists Switzerland, which is connected to the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. The group is helping organize the demonstration under the motto ""Strike WEF.""Ines Yabar has a slightly different view of the event.The young Peruvian was invited as a guest to the World Economic Forum this year. In Lima, she works with others to protect the environment, addresses social problems, and is active as a Global Shaper. This global network of young, committed people between the ages of 20 and 30 is supported by the WEF but organizes itself independently.In Davos, Yabar wants to discuss things with those in power and build bridges, but she also plans to speak plainly. At the same time, she can understand why there are demonstrations outside.""I feel that this shows that young people care and wherever we can we will be protesting because it is important to raise our voice about issues we are passionate about,"" says Yabar. ""But we will also be in rooms where we can talk with people deliberately and intentionally that are making decisions that affect our future.""This year, 50 Global Shapers from around the world will take part in the discussions in Davos.They will discuss social justice , climate change, artificial intelligence (AI) and many other important topics.Being present in Davos is an opportunity for many, especially since many young people are dissatisfied. The current situation cannot continue, says Olajumoke Adekeye.The Nigerian member of the Global Shapers Community is appalled because only 2.8% of the world's parliamentarians are under the age of 30, she says.

Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses due to heightened rivalry from Amazon and Temu.Wesfarmers , which acquired the online retailer for $230million in 2019, issued a closure announcement on Tuesday.According to a Daily Mail report, the company expects an operational deficit reaching $40million in the initial half of 2024-25.“While Catch's financial performance has been challenging, we have gained valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the group's digital transformation and supported the development of the OnePass membership program,” Daily Mail quoted Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott as saying.The company cited intense rivalry from international online retailers such as Temu, Shein, and Amazon.“The recent increase in competitive intensity in the Australian e-commerce sector has affected Catch's financial performance and growth prospects,” according to the announcement.Whilst 100 positions will be preserved and transferred to other Wesfarmers subsidiaries like Kmart, 190 positions will be eliminated.The logistics centres will transition to Kmart's control during the final quarter of 2024-25.Kmart Group Managing Director Ian Bailey indicated the arrangement would enhance customer service through access to Catch's Moorebank warehouse in Sydney's south-west.“Kmart Group can better utilise Catch's fulfilment centres, which are currently less than 50 per cent utilised. The transition will result in faster deliveries to customers at a lower unit cost, while relieving pressure on our busy stores,” he explained.Established by Gabby and Hezi Leibovich as Catch of the Day in 2006, the business gained popularity amongst value-conscious Australian shoppers but ultimately struggled against competitors who faced fewer operational costs and taxes.","Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses.

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900.

Hindenburg's Nate Anderson could face securities fraud charges: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hindenburgs-nate-anderson-could-face-securities-fraud-charges-report/articleshow/117376044.cms,"Nate Anderson , who recently announced the closure of his research firm Hindenburg, faces scrutiny over alleged connections with hedge funds in preparing reports to target companies, reports a Canadian portal citing documents submitted to an Ontario court.Court filings at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice reveal that Moez Kassam, who heads Canada's Anson hedge fund, accepted that his firm has shared research ""with a wide variety of sources"", including Hindenburg's Anderson.According to Market Frauds portal, court documents suggest collaboration between Hindenburg and Anson during report preparation. Such bearish report preparation without proper disclosure of participation could potentially lead to securities fraud charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).""We know for a fact, from the email conversations between Anderson and Anson Funds, that he was indeed working for Anson and published whatever they told him to, from the price target to what should and shouldn't be in the report. He asked them multiple times if they needed 'more'. From what we can see in the dozens of exchanges, at no time did he have editorial control. He was being told what to publish,"" the website claimed.Market Frauds also shared alleged email exchange screenshots between Hindenburg and Anson, which it claims to have obtained from Ontario court documents, to substantiate its allegations.""There are multiple counts of securities fraud for both Anson Funds and Nate Anderson, and we have only gone through 5 per cent of what's in there as of the time of writing. From what we have read so far, it is almost a certainty that when the whole exchange between Hindenburg and Anson reaches the SEC, Nate Anderson will be charged with securities fraud in 2025,"" it said.Short sellers typically borrow securities, sell them in the open market, and aim to repurchase at lower prices following their negative reports. The involvement of hedge funds raises concerns as they might place parallel bets, potentially increasing downward pressure on share prices. Hindenburg Research issued a report in 2020 about Facedrive, a Canadian enterprise that became public via reverse merger, marketing itself as an environmentally conscious ride-sharing service. The report criticised its excessive valuation and generous payments to promoters. Court records indicate Anson communicated with Anderson regarding the report and knew its publication timeline.These legal documents follow a distinct long-term investigation by the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In June, Anson Funds Management and Anson Advisors Inc settled SEC allegations by paying USD 2.25 million, without accepting or denying wrongdoing, for failing to disclose payments to external publishers of negative research.When established, Hindenburg announced receiving ""hundreds of leads each year from diverse sources,"" including sector specialists, informants and fellow investors. ""We rigorously vet each lead and have always maintained full editorial independence over our work.""Anderson announced the closure of Hindenburg Research last week. He gave no specific explanation for his decision but expressed wishes to dedicate more time to personal relationships.""Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking,"" he said in his closure announcement.","Court documents suggest collaboration between Hindenburg and Anson during report preparation.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

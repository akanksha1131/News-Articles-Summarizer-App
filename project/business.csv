US Federal Reserve keeps benchmark rate unchanged in 4.25-4.5% target range at Jerome Powell-led FOMC meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-fomc-meet-jerome-powell-donald-trump-monetary-policy-america-central-bank-rate-inflation-tariffs/articleshow/120972001.cms,"US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell (AP Photo)

The US Federal Reserve , led by chair Jerome Powell , kept benchmark rate unchanged in 4.25-4.5% target range at the FOMC meet on Wednesday. ""The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,"" the FOMC statement read.""Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated,"" the release read.""In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities.The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the central bank added.The Federal Reserve was confronted with a challenging decision regarding its response to President Donald Trump 's tariff implementation: Should it maintain high interest rates to address inflation, remain inactive, or reduce rates to boost growth and employment?Market observers and financial experts had largely anticipated that the Fed will maintain current rates, adopting a wait-and-see approach to evaluate the economic impact of the new tariffs before implementing any changes.The US central bank operates independently under a Congressional mandate to ensure price stability and optimal employment levels, primarily through adjustments to its key short-term lending rate.""It's an unfavorable mix for the Federal Reserve,"" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic had told AFP.""They're going to see upward price pressures at the same time when economic growth is slowing,"" she said. ""And then they'll have to put a weight on what do they believe?""Last month, Trump implemented substantial tariffs on Chinese imports and reduced ""baseline"" duties of 10 percent on products from most nations, leading to several weeks of market volatility.The administration imposed increased duties on numerous trading associates, subsequently halting them until July to allow the United States sufficient time to revise current trade agreements.Recent economic indicators suggest a decline in the first quarter, with both consumers and companies increasing their import purchases before the implementation of new regulations.Simultaneously, employment figures remained near record-low levels, whilst inflation rates moved towards, but stayed marginally higher than, the Federal Reserve's established two percent objective.","US Federal Reserve kept benchmark rate unchanged in 4.25-4.5% target range at the FOMC meet on Wednesday.

After completing its 24k target and reclaiming above the 200 DMA, this is the third consecutive day wherein the index has closed above the same after a 10% flash rally. Given the geopolitical developments and a stretched rally looking tired on charts, we shift our stance to sideways from buy on dip with a short term support seen at 23900 below which weakening momentum could pick up. Despite a strong handover from global front this morning, charts do not warrant for an immediate upside after a flash rally seen in the past 10 trading days.Bank Nifty continued to lead the charge amongst the widely tracked indices with staging a 1800 odd point rally for this week at yesterday’s high. An additional 2000 points targets had opened up on charts after its strong closing on Thursday. Yesterday was the first instance since the panic lows of 7th April that Bank Nifty underperformed Nifty marking an end to its upper hand in this leg.Any closing below 55240 is likely to drag the index on a negative momentum from here on. We shall further the case after Bank Nifty’s reaction near the 56200 levels, as it looks extremely overbought daily and hourly charts.Stock has found strong support from its 5 year trendline earlier this month and this is its 6th touch base on this trendline in the past 5 years , making it all the more stronger.

Bank of England may cut interest rates by 0.25% amid tariff tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bank-of-england-may-cut-interest-rates-by-0-25-amid-tariff-tensions/articleshow/120981811.cms,"AP File Photo

The Bank of England is expected to lower its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point on Thursday, bringing it down to 4.25%, amid fears of US President Donald Trump’s planned tariffs hitting global economic growth, including Britain’s.The decision is due at 11:02 GMT, two minutes later than usual to honour a moment of silence for the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. The US Federal Reserve, on Wednesday, opted to hold borrowing costs steady, while the European Central Bank cut rates last month to stimulate the eurozone economy.Markets are already anticipating the rate cut, however, will be closely looking out for any changes in the language used by the central bank’s monetary policy committee, which could indicate further rate reductions later in the year.Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, chief economist at global financial services group Ebury, said, “While the Bank of England is universally expected to cut (on Thursday)... the key to the reaction in the pound will be the bank's accompanying communications.”He also said the bank would likely lower its forecasts for both inflation and economic growth in 2025, and may warn that US tariffs could slow down the UK economy and reduce inflation.Britain is currently bracing for 10% tariffs on most of its goods exported to the US, its second-largest trading partner after the EU. The new levies are part of a broader wave of trade tensions that have already pushed oil prices down, further easing inflation expectations.BoE governor Andrew Bailey has warned that the tariffs could still be a blow to the UK economy even if Britain escapes the harshest duties. London is engaged in talks with Washington over a post-Brexit trade deal that could see tariffs softened in exchange for adjustments to the UK's digital services tax on US tech giants.The Bank of England last altered interest rates in March, when it held steady at 4.5% after three cuts in the previous seven months, as the UK economy continued to wrestle with a weak growth","The Bank of England is expected to lower its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point on Thursday.

Mumbai: RBI has eased investment restrictions for foreign portfolio investors in the corporate debt market . This move is likely to deepen market liquidity and align India more closely with global capital flows. RBI announced it will remove both the short-term investment cap and the concentration limit that previously applied to FPIs investing through the general route .Under the earlier framework, FPIs could only invest in corporate bonds with a residual maturity of more than one year. Their holdings were also capped at 50% of any single issuance, with tighter limits based on investor type. These constraints, designed to mitigate concentration risk and discourage speculative flows, did not apply to the voluntary retention route, a separate channel with lock-in conditions.The removal of these restrictions grants foreign investors greater freedom to deploy capital tactically.

The company will also cancel 2.1 crore esops that were granted to Vijay and another 2.2 lakh esops to Ajay.Under the settlement terms, Vijay will also not be eligible to receive any esop from any listed company for three years.

The company also allotted esops to Vijay's brother, who under the regulator's rules was categorised under the promoter's family.Sebi's show cause notice said that Vijay, as the CMD of Paytm, had substantial influence over ""decision making of (the) nomination and remuneration committee while approving grant of esops to himself and his brother"".In addition, there were allegations of non-disclosures by Paytm and Vijay Shekhar Sharma.

MUMBAI: The rupee closed at 85.71 against the dollar, down from 84.83 on Wednesday - its worst day since Feb 2023. The currency hit a low of 85.76 during the day, falling more than a rupee from the day's high.The rupee rose at the start of the session and remained steady until early afternoon. However, around 2:30pm, sentiment changed following govt's announcement that Pakistan targeted several military locations in the northern and western regions, which were neutralised by India. Dealers said this was seen as an escalation of the conflict. Equity markets, which were in the green until then, also saw a sharp fall after the statement.Some dealers are forecasting that the rupee could breach the 86 level if tensions continue.""Importers delayed buying dollars, anticipating the rupee would strengthen further. However, after govt confirmed that multiple locations were targeted by Pakistan and that India responded, the situation was seen as an escalation, prompting importers and corporates with ECB obligations to hedge their positions. This led to increased demand for dollars, putting pressure on the rupee,"" said K N Dey, a forex consultant who advises corporates.Dollar-rupee forward premiums also jumped, with the one-year implied yield rising 16 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) to a near one-month high of 2.34%. ""Historically, the rupee weakened during periods of geopolitical tension, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, when India faced indirect economic impacts. Now, with India directly involved in the current conflict, the rupee faces heightened risk, and further escalation could significantly increase pressure on the currency,"" said Dey.Dealers said the escalation of conflict could hurt capital flows if foreign investors turn cautious. The resulting weakening of the rupee would also affect other flows waiting for the currency to stabilise. Part of the dollar's gains on Thursday were also due to a rebound in the greenback. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.46% higher at 100.07. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose 1% to $61.76 per barrel in futures trade.However, given that similar conflicts in the past have not escalated, dealers believe the impact may be temporary. Internationally, the dollar declined sharply in March and April 2025, reflecting reduced investor confidence due to economic policy uncertainty and the impact of new tariffs.","The rupee closed at 85.71 against the dollar, down from 84.83 on Wednesday.

Gates told the New York Times that Musk's severe cuts to the US Agency for International Development were linked to a missed social engagement, appearing to criticise Musk's conduct.""People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them,"" Gates wrote, sharing a chart predicting his net worth will drop by 99% over the next two decades, reflecting a doubling of his philanthropic pace.Citing inspiration from 19th-century philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, Gates clarified he does not want to create a foundation that lasts forever. Gates expressed preference for swift distribution of billions rather than establishing a permanent foundation, citing emerging technologies' potential.Whilst acknowledging private foundations' impact, Gates stressed governmental roles' importance, lamenting significant budget reductions by various wealthy nations.""It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people. But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty,"" he wrote.These changes included Musk's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" severely cutting USAID during Trump's presidency.Gates described these reductions as ""stunning"" and more extensive than anticipated.

The reading came in below economists’ expectations of 230,000, based on a Reuters poll, and reversed some of the prior week’s spike attributed to school spring breaks in New York state.While the weekly drop reflects a still-sturdy job market, economists are increasingly wary of a potential slowdown ahead.President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff hikes—including a 145% duty on Chinese imports—have rattled both business and consumer sentiment, adding pressure to an economy already navigating inflation concerns and slower hiring momentum.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking after the central bank kept interest rates steady at 4.25–4.50% on Wednesday, warned that the scale of tariff increases has been ""significantly larger than anticipated.""He added, “If sustained, they’re likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment.”Despite those concerns, employers appear hesitant to shed workers. Many firms, having struggled to hire during and after the pandemic, remain reluctant to let go of existing employees. However, businesses directly exposed to trade risks have begun modest layoffs, hinting at deeper challenges.A recent ISM manufacturing survey highlighted that employment in the sector remained weak in April, with layoffs noted as the primary adjustment tool—an indication that job cuts are becoming more deliberate.The number of people receiving benefits after their initial claim—a proxy for ongoing hiring—fell by 29,000 to 1.879 million in the week ending April 26. However, other labour indicators flashed concern: while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% in April, the median duration of unemployment rose to 10.4 weeks, up from 9.8 weeks in March.The economy added 177,000 jobs in April, showing moderate job creation but suggesting that hiring momentum may be slowing as businesses grow more cautious amid global trade tensions and monetary policy uncertainty.","Initial jobless claims dropped by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ending May 3.

"What Warren Buffett, world’s 5th richest person, has to say about choosing the right life partner to succeed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-warren-buffett-worlds-5th-richest-person-has-to-say-about-choosing-the-right-life-partner-to-succeed/articleshow/121001274.cms,"Warren Buffett

Famous investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett announced that he will step down as CEO by the end of this year, with Vice Chairman Greg Abel set to succeed him. Buffett, 94, made the announcement during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, adding that he will not sell a single share of Berkshire stock.Buffett's decision comes amid a lifetime of leadership at Berkshire Hathaway, where he transformed a struggling textile mill into one of the world’s most valuable conglomerates. He is widely regarded not only for his investment acumen but also for his personal integrity and long-term thinking.In reflecting on his journey, Buffett has often credited his late wife, Susan Buffett , as the most important influence in his life and success, according to an ET report.“What happened with me would not have happened without her,” Buffett said in HBO’s 2017 documentary Becoming Warren Buffett. The couple married in 1952 and had three children—Susie, Howard, and Peter—before Susan’s death in 2004 from a cerebral haemorrhage.Buffett has repeatedly emphasized the importance of choosing the right life partner. “Marry the right person. I’m serious about that,” he said during a 2009 Berkshire annual meeting.“It will make more difference in your life. It will change your aspirations, all kinds of things.”In a 2017 conversation with Bill Gates, Buffett echoed that sentiment: “You want to associate with people who are the kind of person you’d like to be. You’ll move in that direction. And the most important person by far in that respect is your spouse.”Buffett’s unique personal life has drawn attention over the years. Despite being married to Susan until her death, he fell in love with Astrid Menks, whom Susan had befriended and later introduced to Warren. Despite their physical separation, with Susan residing on the West Coast, they maintained their marriage and remained deeply connected to one another. After Susan moved to San Francisco, she asked Astrid, then working at a local restaurant, to help look after Warren. Astrid later became Buffett’s long-time companion and second wife.“She is a very helping, giving person,” Susan told Charlie Rose in a 2004 interview, explaining how Astrid came to care for Buffett. “She’s really a good soul.”Buffett's legacy as one of the most influential investors in history is tightly interwoven with both his professional brilliance and deeply personal relationships—especially with Susan, whom he often described as the second of only two major turning points in his life. The first, he says, was being born.As Buffett prepares to hand over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway to Greg Abel, his advice to future generations remains grounded in humility: choose the right people, both in life and business.","Buffett, 94, made the announcement during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting.

Bitcoin soared past $101,000, crude oil prices advanced, and gold fell as investors moved away from traditional safe havens.President Donald Trump described the agreement as a “maxed-out trade deal,” noting it would maintain a 10% tariff on British goods but reduce taxes on U.K.luxury automobiles like Rolls-Royce. In return, Britain would provide greater access for American exports including beef and ethanol. Trump said the deal's final details could take weeks but called it a major step forward.Markets also reacted to potentially promising developments in trade negotiations with China. Ahead of weekend talks in Switzerland, Trump said tariff reductions on Chinese goods “could be” considered depending on the outcome.“Right now, you can’t get any higher. It’s at 145. So we know it’s coming down,” he added, referring to the current tariff rate.Investor enthusiasm was further boosted by strong corporate earnings. Shares of Axon Enterprise jumped 14.4% after raising its full-year forecast, and Tapestry rose 4.1% on better-than-expected earnings and growth among younger North American consumers.However, not all companies shared the upbeat tone.

Krispy Kreme plunged 23.3% after withdrawing its full-year outlook due to economic softness and delays in expanding McDonald’s distribution.While the Federal Reserve maintained that the economy remains solid, concerns linger.

Bank of England cuts interest rate by 25 bps amid global trade uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rate-by-25-bps-amid-global-trade-uncertainty/articleshow/120998941.cms,"AI generated image

The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25%, citing concerns over the potential global economic slowdown driven by the trade policies of the Trump administration.The decision announced on Thursday, comes just hours before a widely anticipated US-UK trade deal is expected to be unveiled. President Donald Trump described the upcoming agreement on his Truth Social platform as a “full and comprehensive” deal that will “cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.”The move by the UK's central bank underscores growing fears that escalating tariffs—particularly between the US and key trading partners like China and the UK—could derail global growth.Economists believe that despite current inflationary pressures in Britain, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) opted for a pre-emptive rate cut to cushion against a potential external demand shock.“This rate cut reflects early signs that the MPC is willing to adopt a more proactive approach to loosening policy in light of US trade policy shocks,” Edward Allenby, UK economist at Oxford Economics told news agency AP.The MPC’s decision was revealed at 12:02 p.m., two minutes later than usual in observance of the Victory in Europe Day silence. It marks the latest in a series of quarterly rate cuts since August 2024, when the Bank began reducing borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 5.25%.Markets and analysts were closely watching the Bank’s updated economic forecasts, which are the first since Trump’s early April tariff announcement. While many tariffs were paused for a 90-day period following market volatility, the economic outlook remains clouded by uncertainty.Although UK inflation currently sits at 2.6% and could temporarily rise further due to a raft of price increases in April—particularly in energy and water bills—analysts believe the Bank prioritized shielding the economy from the broader impact of trade tensions and falling demand.In contrast, the US Federal Reserve held rates steady on Wednesday, choosing to wait for more clarity on how US tariffs will influence domestic economic conditions. The European Central Bank also cut rates last month, aligning with the Bank of England’s more dovish stance.Central banks globally have shifted gears as inflation retreats from multidecade highs seen in recent years, a period marked by aggressive rate hikes to combat pandemic-related supply shocks and energy price spikes following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.While further cuts are expected, economists largely agree that interest rates are unlikely to return to the ultra-low levels that characterized the post-2008 financial crisis and the pandemic era.",The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25%.

Details of deal?





US President Donald Trump announced Thursday an agreement with Britain on trade, which would be the first such deal since he launched his global tariffs blitz.Trump provided no details about the scope of the agreement, which comes a month after he imposed sweeping tariffs on US trading partners on his April 2 ""Liberation Day"".""The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,"" the president posted on his Truth Social platform.""Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!""Trump is set to speak further about the agreement at a news conference in the White House scheduled for 10:00 am (1400 GMT).The Wall Street Journal described it as a ""framework"" agreement, suggesting it was far from a comprehensive free trade deal sought by the UK following its departure from the European Union.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is also set to give an update on the matter Thursday.""Talks with the US have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,"" he told a London conference on defence.""But make no mistake, I will always act in our national interest, for workers, businesses and families, to deliver security and renewal for our country,"" the PM added.The Labour leader, who like Trump won power last year, had pushed for a trade deal before the president unleashed his tariffs blitz on Britain and countries worldwide.The president slapped 10 percent tariffs on imports from around the world, including Britain, but he temporarily froze higher duties on dozens of nations to allow for negotiations.Trump described Starmer as a tough negotiator following the latter's visit to Washington in February.Reaching a post-Brexit agreement with the United States has been the Holy Grail for Britain since it exited the European Union at the start of the decade.London is keen to achieve some type of accord with Washington ahead of a EU-UK summit on May 19 due to reset ties with the 27-nation bloc.A US-UK deal could prove problematic for the EU, which is struggling to reach an acceptable trade deal of its own with the United States.Britain this week struck a free-trade agreement with India, its biggest such deal since leaving the EU, after negotiations relaunched in February following US tariff threats.The EU remains Britain's biggest trading partner, while the United States is the UK's single largest country trading partner.Trump has for weeks claimed that countries are lining up to strike trade agreements with the US.Reports have suggested that Washington may reduce certain tariffs on British products in exchange for relief from the UK's digital services tax paid by US tech giants.London did not retaliate against the Trump's 10-percent tariff imposed on UK imports, nor to the higher 25-percent levies for steel, aluminium and the automotive sector.""Any deal with the US is likely to be damage limitation rather than an economic boost,"" Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King's College London, told AFP.""It is likely to limit the Trump tariffs, but ... exporters will probably still be facing higher tariffs overall than they were last year.""Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid said ""given that full trade deals take years to negotiate, this will likely be a framework and it will be interesting to see whether the 10-percent baseline tariff stays as that will provide an important template for negotiations with other countries"".Sky News reported that London has agreed concessions on food and agriculture imports with Washington in exchange for easing export tariffs on the automotive industry.The Financial Times added that London has sought to avert possible future US tariffs on major industries including pharmaceuticals and aerospace.The film industry, a key UK export for the services sector is also in Trump's sights.The Bank of England cut its interest rate by a quarter point to 4.25 percent on Thursday as the tariffs threaten to weaken global economic growth.","US President Donald Trump announces trade agreement with UK.

User Development Fee revised for business & economy class international fliers, domestic passengers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/aera-sets-new-tariff-structure-at-mumbai-airport-introduces-differential-udf-for-international-flyers/articleshow/120994562.cms,"Photo - ANI

The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA) has announced revised tariffs for Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International (CSMI) Airport, including a differential User Development Fee (UDF) for international economy and business class passengers, and a fixed UDF for domestic flyers. These changes will be effective from May 16, 2025, to March 31, 2029.In an official release on Thursday, AERA said the UDF for domestic passengers departing from Mumbai will be set at Rs 175 per person, a rate that will remain unchanged throughout the fourth control period, news agency PTI reported. This marks an increase from the earlier charge of Rs 120, which was levied as a development fee until August 2024.For international travellers, the UDF has been rationalised based on class of travel. Departing economy class passengers will pay Rs 615, while business class passengers will be charged Rs 695.“The adjustment aligns with the 'User Pays' principle and reflects the enhanced passenger experience and expanded facilities available and used by international travellers,” AERA said.In addition to the UDF changes, AERA has also rationalised landing and parking charges for airlines, keeping them at competitive and reasonable levels to avoid burdening airline operations and to maintain operational efficiency.According to the regulator, domestic passengers account for around 75% of total passenger traffic at Mumbai airport. The nominal UDF of Rs 175 aims to protect passenger interests, ensure affordability, and promote growth in the domestic aviation sector.AERA stated that the revised tariff structure — including the new UDF rates and adjusted aeronautical charges — is designed to support infrastructure development at CSMI Airport while ensuring the financial viability of the airport operator.The airport is managed by Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), a consortium led by the Adani Group.“AERA remains committed to fostering a transparent, fair, and balanced regulatory environment for the aviation sector, promoting economic growth, and enhancing the passenger experience across India’s major airports,” the release added.","The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA) has announced revised tariffs for Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International (CSMI) Airport.

The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal on Thursday aimed at reducing the impact of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, potentially delivering a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.Trump stated on Wednesday that he would announce a “major trade deal” with a “big, highly respected country,” without naming the nation. A US official later confirmed that the country in question was Britain, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks before the official announcement, news agency AP reported.Starmer’s office indicated that the prime minister would provide an “update” on the US trade talks later in the day. “As you know, talks with the US have been ongoing and you’ll hear more from me about that later today,” Starmer said at a defence conference in London.Under Trump, the US imposed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, along with 25% tariffs on UK cars, steel, and aluminum, aimed at increasing domestic factory jobs. A key goal for British negotiators has been to reduce or remove the US import tax on British cars and steel.While a trade deal with the UK would be symbolically significant and offer relief for British exporters, it would not address Trump’s main concern of reducing the trade deficits that led him to impose tariffs on various countries.The US ran an $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the UK last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods imported from the UK accounted for only 2% of all US imports.Trump has been eager to strike a deal with the UK since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. As recently as Tuesday, however, Trump seemed unaware of the potential terms of the deal when asked about it.“They’re offering us concessions?” Trump asked reporters. “I hope so... They do want to make a deal very badly.”Trump has previously suggested that his leverage in the talks comes from US consumers, but also hinted that the UK would start purchasing more American-made goods.“I think that the United Kingdom, like every other country, they want to, they want to be, go shopping in the United States of America,” he said.",US and Britain expected to announce a trade deal aimed at reducing the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.

Asian and European markets mostly rose Thursday ahead of weekend tariff talks between China and the United States, with London boosted by reports that a ""major trade deal "" flagged by Donald Trump was with Britain.After the fireworks sparked by the US president's ""Liberation Day"" on April 2, markets have enjoyed a period of calm in recent weeks on optimism that countries will reach agreements with Washington to avoid his potentially damaging tariffs.That sentiment was given a boost this week when Chinese and US officials said top negotiators would meet on Saturday and Sunday for their first talks since Trump unveiled his bombshell levies. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will attend the meeting in Switzerland with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng.The gathering has fuelled hopes for a dialling down of tensions between the world's economic superpowers , which has seen Washington impose levies of 145 percent on China and Beijing retaliate with 125 percent tolls of its own.Meanwhile, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would announce ""a major trade deal with representatives of a big and highly respected country"" at 10:00 am (1400 GMT) Thursday.He did not say which country he was talking about but the New York Times and Politico cited multiple sources as saying it was Britain.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he would give an ""update"" later in the day.The pound extended gains to spike at $1.3377 but later eased back to sit barely moved from the day before.London was on the front foot in the morning, tracking gains in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, and Mumbai.Paris and Frankfurt also enjoyed gains, while US futures were up.Singapore, Wellington, Manila, Bangkok, and Jakarta fell, while Taipei was flat.The White House's hardball approach to trade continues to cause anxiety, and Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell warned Wednesday that there was ""a great deal of uncertainty"" about where the administration's policies will end up.Trump's moves have sent shivers through world markets, and fuelled fears of a global recession and speculation of a reordering of the decades-old trading norms.In a news conference after the Fed stood pat on interest rates, Powell said: ""If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained they're likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.""""The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level,"" he added, but also warned it was ""possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent.""The Fed, in its post-meeting statement, said that ""uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further"" and that the chances of higher unemployment and inflation had also risen.Trump has in recent weeks hit out at Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough, and last month markets were roiled by fears he could try to oust him.Analysts do not expect the central bank to move until July at the earliest.""Recent job data, including last Friday's non-farm payroll, indicate solid momentum, allowing the Fed to maintain its current stance,"" said Tai Hui of JP Morgan Asset Management.""With only one more set of job data expected before the June 17-18 meetings, the likelihood of a rate cut in June is low.""The Fed aims to assert its independence amidst pressure from President Trump to reduce rates, requiring significant deterioration in hard data to justify a cut.""","Asian and European markets mostly rose Thursday ahead of weekend tariff talks between China and the United States.

Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on several trading partners last month, pausing some temporarily to allow room for negotiations.Britain, meanwhile, has been actively seeking new trade partnerships since leaving the European Union. Just this week, it secured a free-trade agreement with India, the largest such pact it has signed since Brexit.UK Prime minister Keir Starmer visited Washington in February to discuss trade and tariffs, and sources say he returned optimistic about the possibility of striking a deal with the US.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

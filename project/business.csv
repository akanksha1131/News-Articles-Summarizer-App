"From golf to crypto: Trump declares over $600 million income, $1.6 billion in total assets, claims report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-golf-to-crypto-trump-declares-over-600-million-income-1-6-billion-in-total-assets-claims-report/articleshow/121843615.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

In a financial disclosure report released on Friday, Donald Trump declared over $600 million in earnings from various ventures including cryptocurrency , golf establishments, licensing agreements and other business interests, reported Reuters.The financial report, apparently covering the 2024 calendar year, indicates that the president's cryptocurrency investments significantly enhanced his wealth, alongside substantial development fees and revenue from other enterprises. The president's total declared assets amount to at least $1.6 billion, according to Reuters calculations.Despite Trump's assertion that his business interests are managed by a trust under his children's supervision, the disclosures reveal that income from these sources ultimately benefits the president, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.Certain business ventures, particularly in cryptocurrency, have benefited from policy changes under his administration, drawing criticism.The financial disclosure, reportedly signed on June 13, did not specify its coverage period. However, the cryptocurrency details and other information suggest coverage through December 2024, excluding most earnings from the family's recent cryptocurrency ventures.The document represents a specific moment in time, capturing the family's initial foray into cryptocurrency while maintaining their traditional interests in property development and golf establishments.The president's meme coin, $TRUMP, launched this year, has generated approximately $320 million in fees, though the distribution between Trump-controlled entities and partners remains unclear.Beyond meme coin earnings, the Trump family has accumulated over $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralised finance organisation. Their portfolio also includes bitcoin mining operations and digital asset exchange-traded funds.The disclosures show Trump received $57.35 million from World Liberty token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture.The Republican president's wealth spans cryptocurrency to real estate, with a significant portion linked to his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social.Beyond business venture assets and revenues, the president reported minimum earnings of $12 million from passive investments totalling at least $211 million, including interest and dividends, according to Reuters calculations.His primary investments were in Blue Owl Capital Corp and government bond funds managed by Charles Schwab and Invesco.The disclosure provided value ranges for assets and income; Reuters used minimum values, suggesting higher actual totals.The report also detailed income from various Florida properties. His three golf resorts - Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach - plus Mar-a-Lago members' club generated minimum earnings of $217.7 million.Trump National Doral, featuring the Blue Monster course, proved the family's highest income source at $110.4 million. These figures represent revenue rather than net profit.The disclosure highlighted international business interests, including $5 million in Vietnamese development licence fees, $10 million from an Indian project, and nearly $16 million in Dubai licensing fees.Additional royalties came from various sources: $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (""the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump""); $2.8 million from Trump Watches; and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances.Trump earned $1.16 million from NFT digital trading cards, while First Lady Melania Trump received approximately $216,700 from her NFT collection licensing fees.","Donald Trump declared over $600 million in earnings from various ventures including cryptocurrency, golf establishments, licensing agreements and other business interests.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: The ongoing Iran-Israel conflict has brought gold back into focus as a safe haven investment and gold rate has been rising for some days now.On June 16, spot gold surged to $3,451 in the overnight trade as Iran and Israel stepped up their attacks on each other in the weekend. Gold prices eased as the day progressed on the notion that the ongoing military conflict would be confined.The Wall Street Journal reporting that Tehran has signalled its willingness to deescalate the conflict and resume nuclear talks with the US provided the US does not join the Israeli attacks further boosted the downside pressure on the yellow metal. Reuters also reported the willingness of Iran to de-escalate as conveyed through Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman.Spot gold traded between $3383 and $3451 on Monday. At the time of writing this article, the metal was changing hands at $3398, down nearly 1% on the day. The MCX August gold contract was trading at Rs 99,280, down roughly 1% on the day.Although, reportedly Iran is willing to defuse the conflict, Reuters has cited Iranian State media saying that Iran is preparing for the largest and most intense missile attack in history on Israeli soil.Israeli's PM Netanyahu, in his direct address to the Iranian people, called for overthrowing the clerical regime. Earlier he said that for three decades, the central threat to Israel's existence has been Iran's nuclear programs.Casualties have been reported by both nations as Israel dealt the worst military blow to the Islamic Republic since it was invaded by Iraq in 1980.Spot gold surged 3.68% in the week ending June 13 as the metal rose sharply in the last two trading days of the week on geopolitical concerns emanating from the Middle East due to the Iran-Israel conflict.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 88.85 as of June 13 as ETFs recorded net inflows for the third straight week. Holdings are up 7.25% YTD.As per CFTC data, money managers decreased their bullish gold bets by 657 net-long positions to 129,851 in the week ending June 10 as long-only positions fell 772 lots to 164,315 lots. The short-only total at 34,664 was the lowest in 11 weeks.China's data released on Monday morning were mixed as retail sales (May) came in at 6.4% Vs the estimate of 4.90%, while industrial production (May) at 5.8% lagged the estimate of 6%. Meanwhile, property market data continued to reflect weakness, though jobless rate edged lower from 5.1% to 5% Vs the forecast of 5.1%.At the time of writing, the US Dollar Index, at 98, was hovering near a four-year low. Ten-year and thirty-year US yields were up by around 0.65% on inflation concerns due to rising oil prices.Today's major US data on cards include retail sales advance (May), industrial production (May) and import and export price indices (May).The Bank of Japan will announce its monetary policy decision on June 17 wherein it is expected to keep the target rate unchanged at 0.5% amid trade uncertainty.The US Federal Reserve will deliver its monetary policy decision on June 18.Although the FOMC is expected to keep the overnight Fed Fund rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.50%, traders will look forward to clues to possible rate cuts as CPI and PPI data of May have been somewhat comforting.The Bank of England is set to announce its monetary policy on June 19. Traders expect the Bank to keep the Bank rate unchanged at 4.25%; however, the Bank's hint at possible easing going forward would be the major attraction for traders.In the very short term, gold moves will depend on the Iran-Israel conflict.US President Trump has confirmed Iran’s inclination to talk about de-escalating the ongoing military conflict. However, Israel also needs to reciprocate. Positive ETF inflows and weakness in the US Dollar also support the yellow metal. Overall, if both Israel and Iran agree to sort out their differences through dialogues and Iran agrees to hold a nuclear deal talk, gold will fall further. In that case, gold can fall to as low as $3228. However, if the situation remains uncertain and the conflict continues, gold will have a good buying support.Overall, as the things stand presently, gold is likely to trade with a slight bearish tilt, though there are multiple factors like fiscal concerns, weaker Dollar, central banks’ buying gold, geopolitical concerns due to wars and conflicts elsewhere, and investors looking for alternatives to the US assets, etc., that are supporting the gold rally.Considering Israel-Iran conflict de-escalation, traders may take a light sell position in the metal for very short-term trading. It is to be noted that US retail sales data and upcoming FOMC meeting will also be on traders’ radar.","Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for.

NEW DELHI: Generative AI, while being used by cyber criminals to further their activities, will also help create stronger and swifter counter-measures, making the internet safer to use, according to Heather Adkins, global VP of engineering for Google Security. Adkins, who spent over two decades at Google, also believes that rise in geopolitical tensions may fuel state-backed cyberattacks, making the world more vulnerable.However, she added that Indian govt has been at forefront of taking measures to counter cyber threats effectively, ahead of many other countries. This will also see Google Security set up an engineering centre in India.Talking to TOI on the sidelines of the 'Safer with Google India Summit', Adkins said while companies create tools to tackle cyber threats, it is equally important to sensitise users about measures to identify malicious and fraudulent content. ""Unlike the physical world where you have instincts and senses to identify something dangerous, the online world does not have a parallel. We have to build that.""Speaking about state-sponsored cyber threats, she said they can sometimes be more focused and successful with capabilities to deploy large teams towards such activities. ""It's a question of who has more time. And, if you think about a well-funded nation state, may be they'll create a project, put 100 people on it, and they just work on that project throughout the day...So, they often know more because they have more time, not because they're smarter. I would say they're more likely to be successful.""On Gen AI and whether it aids cyber criminals too, Adkins said, ""There's no doubt that we're seeing an increase in tempo and sophistication of attacks... But I also feel that today, more than ever before, enterprises have better tools. If I think about starting a company 23 years ago, cybersecurity looked primitive then. Today, most of the solutions you're going to buy have security built into them. So, you're in a much better place than you were, say, 20-30 years ago. ""She said that Gen AI will give ""defenders"" a ""leg up"" over the threat actors. ""We will be able to leverage Gen AI to protect infrastructure in new ways that we've never thought of before and also at a speed that we've never been able to achieve before.""On India, she said govt here is ""very engaged"" on cyber safety. ""... it's a hot topic. They've done a very good job in getting involved quickly and partnering with companies. The workforce here and education levels in India are pretty high. There are parts of the world I go where they're just now starting to think about cyber security and they're much further behind India.""",Google Security's Heather Adkins highlights the dual role of generative AI in cybersecurity.

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has clarified that Ratan Tata’s holdings in listed and unlisted companies will go to his two foundations and not to his half-sisters and former confidant Mohini Dutta.The clarification comes after executors of Tata’s estate sought guidance from the High Court on who would inherit the late industrialist’s equity portfolio. The June 16 order now paves the way for the probate of Tata’s will, which is expected in a month.While there was no dispute among the executors, some of them are also beneficiaries, and other heirs of Tata’s estate, originating summons were filed to address questions stemming from the effect of the fourth or final codicil on Tata’s will, the HC said in its June 16 order.The question at hand was whether Tata’s share portfolio will stand bequeathed according to clauses 4 to 8 of his will to half-sisters Shireen and Deanna Jejeebhoy, and Dutta, or whether it will be part of his residue asset and go to his two foundations, Ratan Tata Endowment Foundation (RTEF) and Ratan Tata Endowment Trust (RTET), as outlined in clause 13 of his will as substituted by the fourth codicil.The Jejeebhoy sisters are both among the executors and beneficiaries of Tata’s estate.The order pointed out that a testator can introduce alterations to his will through codicils and past Supreme Court judgments have established that codicils will prevail over the will. Therefore, Tata’s will has to be considered with alterations/additions made in the codicils.Justice Manish Pitale said Tata’s holdings in listed and unlisted shares, not specifically covered in his will, form part of his residue asset and stand bequeathed to his two foundations in equal shares.To be sure, his Tata Sons shares, valued at Rs 1,684 crore, have been explicitly mentioned in his will as being bequeathed to RTEF and RTET in a 70:30 ratio. The clarification is on his non-Tata Sons shares, worth over Rs 1,547 crore, which will now go to the two foundations in a 50:50 ratio.His non-Tata Sons shares include TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Investment Corporation, RNT Associates, Pritish Nandy Communications, as well as startups like Curefit, Avanti Finance and Electrodrive Powertrain Solutions (Electra EV). Additionally, he held foreign shares in Howmet Aerospace and Alcoa Corp, both listed on the NYSE.Some of his investments have seen significant growth over the years. For example, his Rs 16.9 crore investment in Avanti Finance, a company he co-founded with economist Vijay Kelkar and Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani in 2016, has grown to Rs 53.5 crore as of September 2024.","The Bombay high court has clarified that Ratan Tata’s holdings in listed and unlisted companies will go to his two foundations.

CHENNAI: Coins are going for a toss, literally. Thanks to a substantial jump in UPI transactions, the value and volume of coins in circulation is witnessing a dip YoY.An analysis by TOI based on data in RBI’s annual reports over the past one decade reveals that the volume of coins in circulation increased by just 3.6% in 202425 over 2023-24 when compared with 8.5% growth during 2016-17 (when UPI came into being) vs 2015-16. Its value of increase also reduced by about 5% from 14.7% (201617 vs 2015-16) to 9.6% (2024-25 vs 2023-24).The volume of coins in circulation in multiple denominations such as 50 paise, Re 1, Rs 2, Rs 5, Rs 10 and Rs 20 stood at 13.7 lakh pieces valuing Rs 36,589 crore as on March 31, 2025. Coins of Re 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5 together constituted 81.6% of the total volume of coins in circulation, while in value terms, these denominations accounted for 64.2%.Subsequently, the number of UPI transactions spiralled from 6.4 million with a value of Rs 2,425 crore by the end of March 2017 to a whopping 18.3 billion UPI transactions with a value of Rs 24,77,221 crore in March 2025, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) data states.

Gov Walz CONFIRMS Vance Boelter's ARREST After NFL Star Blames Him For 'Chaos' In State | WATCH

Suspect has been identified as Vance Boelter

Poll Should lawmakers receive increased security measures after such incidents? Yes, absolutely. No, they should manage without.





Minnesota authorities have arrested Vance Boelter, 57, the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, ending an intense two-day manhunt that left the state on edge.The suspect is also accused of wounding State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife Yvette in a separate attack at their Minneapolis suburban home. During both incidents, the assailant reportedly wore a rubber mask and posed as a law enforcement officer.Investigators discovered the suspect had compiled a notebook containing approximately 70 potential targets, including both lawmakers. Before fleeing one of the crime scenes, he allegedly opened fire on responding officers.The manhunt intensified Saturday night when SWAT teams converged on a residence in Plymouth, Minnesota, roughly 12 miles west of Minneapolis. The search expanded to Sibley County the following day, where authorities recovered the suspect's vehicle and hat, approximately an hour's drive from the attack sites.Prior to the shootings, Boelter exhibited suspicious behavior, including emptying his bank account and prepaying four months' rent – at $220 monthly – for a room he occasionally occupied in Minneapolis. The payment was made to David Carlson, who described himself as one of Boelter's closest friends since elementary school.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Minnesota authorities have arrested Vance Boelter, 57, the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark.

DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: Manoj Sharma doesn't fly by the book in the Kedarnath sector — he flies by sight, by wind, by instinct. ""We are flying in one of the world's most unforgiving regions with very little real-time weather support,"" he said. ""Operations in such large numbers are being conducted on pilot observation and visual reference. The weather is very unpredictable and changes very rapidly.""That reality, long known to those in the cockpit, now has the country's attention. In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents — two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage — all on the Kedar route. In one case, a Kestrel Aviation helicopter crash-landed near a road after a mechanical failure, injuring the pilot and damaging a vehicle.This is not an outlier year. In 2022, an Aryan Aviation chopper crashed near Kedarnath, killing seven. In 2023, Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) finance controller Amit Saini died after being struck by a tail rotor. And in 2013, a military rescue helicopter went down during flood relief, killing 20.The terrain is tough — but it is not the only challenge. The system built to manage it is, in many ways, still catching up to the traffic it supports.Pilgrimage flights have surged over the past decade, but the region lacks a dedicated air traffic control network.""There is no ATC control nor any weather station in these areas,"" said a veteran pilot. ""Flying in the narrow valley from Gaurikund to Kedarnath needs a lot of experience and safety awareness, as there are no landing sites on this stretch that can be used in an emergency or bad weather."" Another pilot added, ""There is no information provided on routes where major helicopter operations take place. Till such time these issues can't be addressed, these operations should immediately be stopped. ""This month, the civil aviation ministry suspended Aryan Aviation from Char Dham operations and grounded two TransBharat pilots who flew in unsuitable weather, suspending their licences for six months.UCADA — established by the state in 2013 to oversee civil aviation development and safety, including helipad infrastructure and coordination with private operators — has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review with all operators and setting up a command-and-control room to monitor real-time risks. DGCA has deployed officers to oversee safety, airworthiness and the functioning of the control centre.But many in the sector say these moves fall short. ""It seems there are no checks and balances in place,"" said one chopper operator. ""There is someone who replaced one inoperative part on a chopper with another inoperative part from another chopper to show that the part has been changed. Because of unscrupulous operators, conscientious operators and passengers are suffering.""Others point to a deeper culture of pressure and compromise. ""There have been five chopper crashes in the country within the last 1.5 months, which is the worst we have ever seen in helicopter operations in our country,"" said a senior pilot. ""Char Dham operations are one of the toughest... yet we still fly as if nothing needs fixing.""Another pilot was more direct: ""We need a complete stop on chopper operations for this yatra season. All stakeholders — owners, pilots, commercial, engineers, DGCA and UCADA — need to look within and change."" One added, simply, ""It's greed. That's what's driving this. Not safety.""","In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents. Two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage.

The US federal reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged Wednesday after concluding its latest policy meeting, as officials weigh the impact of tariffs on inflation and assess broader economic signals.The central bank has maintained the benchmark lending rate at 4.25–4.50 per cent throughout the year. Analysts believe policymakers will continue with this cautious stance until inflation shows clear signs of cooling.While US President Donald Trump has imposed 10 per cent tariffs on most US trading partners and higher levies on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, these moves have yet to push up consumer prices significantly. This limited impact is partly due to delayed implementation of some tariffs and businesses relying on existing inventory to avoid immediate price hikes.In May, the consumer price index rose to 2.4 per cent year-on-year, slightly higher than April’s 2.3 per cent, suggesting that tariff effects have not fully materialised.Economists warn that it may take months for the full impact of tariffs to be reflected in consumer prices.As a result, the Fed is taking a ""wait-and-see"" approach to interest rate decisions.""The Fed would no doubt be cutting again by now if not for the uncertainty regarding tariffs and a recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East,"" said KPMG senior economist Benjamin Shoesmith.Policymakers are also focused on keeping inflation expectations “anchored”. If consumers and businesses begin to anticipate higher prices, inflation could become self-reinforcing through increased wage demands and higher costs.On Wednesday, the Fed will also release updated economic projections covering GDP growth , unemployment, and inflation. Analysts are watching to see whether the Fed still expects two rate cuts this year.Despite repeated calls from Trump for lower interest rates, including public criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell, officials have reiterated the Fed’s independence and commitment to data-driven decision-making.Trump has argued that rate cuts would help reduce interest payments on government debt, but economists point out that lower rates typically increase consumer prices.Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, said Powell is unlikely to be swayed by political pressure, citing continued consumer spending and job creation. ""Certainly, the health of the economy doesn't beg for the Fed to cut rates,"" he said, ""so we think they're on hold till the end of the year.""",The US federal reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged Wednesday after concluding its latest policy meeting.

About Regencell Bioscience Holdings: The Stock That Rose 46,000%

Imagine a stock rising a whopping 46,000%, when the company makes no revenue! As unbelievable as it sounds, that’s the case for a herbal medicine biotech company. The shares of Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited have jumped by a mind-boggling 46,000% in 2025, despite having no revenue generation since its establishment!The Hong Kong-based organisation, which began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market in 2021, has witnessed an inexplicable 460-fold increase in 2025, despite minimal corporate announcements. According to its latest annual SEC filing, the company remains in its research and development phase, having generated no revenue since its inception.According to a Bloomberg report, Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited has transformed from a penny stock in April to achieve a market value of approximately $30 billion. The company's market capitalisation stood at merely $53 million a year ago. The firm reported a net loss of $4.4 million for the fiscal year ending June 2024, which is a 28% reduction compared to the previous period.The company's board sanctioned a 38-for-1 stock split in early 2025. Following the split's implementation on Monday, the share price rose by 283%, marking its highest single-day increase in nearly a year and triggering multiple trading halts due to volatility.The company has primarily sustained its operations through shareholder loans and IPO proceeds, as per the SEC documentation. The IPO generated gross proceeds of $21.85 million, whilst additional net proceeds of $2.85 million were obtained from over allotment shares and the exercise of 325,000 shares.Based in the Cayman Islands, the organisation specialises in developing natural herb-based medicines for treating neurological conditions such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder, according to its website.Their product candidates are derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations, which they emphasise contain exclusively natural components without synthetic additives.""We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable,"" the company stated in an October filing.In 2022, the organisation expanded into Covid-19 treatments, conducting clinical trials for their experimental comprehensive treatment approach. Regencell reported that their 2022 trial data demonstrated the treatment's effectiveness in alleviating and eliminating Covid symptoms within six days, though these findings await peer review validation.The significant fluctuations in Regencell shares can be attributed to its limited float, the Bloomberg report said. Of the company's approximately 500 million outstanding shares, merely 30 million are tradeable, representing about 6% of total shares.This stands in stark contrast to Apple Inc., with 98% tradeable shares, and Tesla Inc., with 87%. The remaining Regencell shares are held by insiders, with Chief Executive Officer Yat-Gai Au controlling 86%, according to Bloomberg's compiled holding data.","Shares of Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited have jumped by a mind-boggling 46,000% in 2025, despite having no revenue generation since its establishment.

Analysts attributed part of the slowdown to consumers front-loading purchases in April ahead of impending tariffs on automobiles.“Today’s data suggests consumers are downshifting, but they haven’t yet slammed the brakes,” said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, as quoted AP.Adding to the unease, President Donald Trump left the G7 summit early and urged immediate evacuation of Tehran, just hours after calling a nuclear deal with Iran “achievable.” The shift in tone added to market anxiety over the Israel-Iran conflict, which threatens to disrupt global oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz.In response, oil prices surged. Benchmark US crude rose 2.7% to $73.71, while Brent crude gained 2.8% to $75.25 per barrel, extending Friday’s 7% rally before easing slightly on Monday.Despite usually benefiting from high oil prices, solar stocks tumbled on fears that US Congress may roll back clean energy tax credits. Enphase Energy plunged 24.4% and First Solar fell 18%.On the upside, Jabil jumped 11.6% after posting better-than-expected earnings, with CEO Mike Dastoor citing strong AI-related demand.Verve Therapeutics soared 79% after Eli Lilly announced it would acquire the genetic medicine firm in a deal worth up to $1.3 billion, including milestone payments. Shares of Lilly dipped 1.3%.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting with markets widely expecting rates to remain unchanged. The Fed has held off on further cuts after easing once late last year, as it monitors the impact of Trump’s tariffs and watches inflation trends.While inflation has remained near the Fed’s 2% target, the central bank’s updated economic and interest rate projections — due Wednesday — are expected to provide clearer cues for the second half of the year.Bond yields fell slightly after the retail report. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.41% (from 4.46% Monday), while the 2-year yield — more sensitive to Fed expectations — slipped to 3.95% from 3.97%.Globally, European stock indexes fell, while Asia saw mixed trade.

China, the top crude importer, is expected to follow suit with a decline beginning in 2028.Middle East demand will peak in 2027, then begin falling in 2028, with Saudi Arabia forecast to post the ""single largest decline in oil demand for any country"" in absolute terms. The drop comes as the kingdom accelerates efforts to replace oil-fired power generation with gas and renewables.Meanwhile, the IEA noted that recent oil price spikes — triggered by conflict between Israel and Iran — are not backed by market fundamentals.“We have a lot of supply in the market. Demand is much weaker than the supply,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said, adding that the agency does not expect elevated prices to persist. The IEA, he said, is prepared to act if supply disruptions occur.Despite short-term risks, supply growth is expected to outpace demand through 2030.

Israel-Iran conflict to cause spike in global gasoline prices?

Not the only concern for investors

(With AP inputs)

Oil prices resumed their upward climb and US futures were lower early Tuesday after Israel's military issued an ""evacuation warning"" for Iran's capital Tehran amid continuing military hostilities between the two Asian rivals.The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.3 per cent.In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.6 per cent to 38,547.56 as the Japanese central bank opted to keep its key interest rate unchanged at 0.5 per cent.Chinese shares edged lower, as the Shanghai Composite index declined 0.2 per cent to 3,382.14. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng slipped 0.1 per cent to 24,038.56, while South Korea's Kospi gained 0.4 per cent to 2,956.88.Taiwan's Taiex also gained, rising 0.6 per cent, and in Bangkok the SET was little changed.Meanwhile, in Australia, the S&P/ASX 500 gave up 0.1 per cent to 8,543.60.As Israel and Iran attack each other, the fear remains that a wider war could limit the flow of Iran's oil to its customers. That in turn could raise gasoline prices worldwide and keep them high, though spikes in prices from previous conflicts have been brief.Crude jumped 7 per cent late last week after Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets. Early Tuesday, US benchmark crude oil gained 31 cents to $72.08 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, was up 33 cents at $73.56 per barrel.Israel's latest evacuation warning was for a part of Tehran, a city of 9.5 million which houses the Islamic Republic's state TV, city police headquarters and three large hospitals, including one owned by the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. US President Donald Trump announced he was returning from the G7 summit in Canada a day early due to the intensifying conflict.However, investors have other concerns as well, key among them Trump's tariffs, which still threaten to slow the American economy and raise inflation if Washington doesn't win trade deals with other countries.The spectre of tariffs was looming over the meeting of the Group of Seven meeting of major economies in Canada.Additionally, on Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve is set to discuss whether to lower or raise interest rates.","Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.3 per cent.

From cars to couture: Kering appoints Renault’s Luca De Meo to lead Gucci; French high-fashion brand hopes for revival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-cars-to-couture-kering-appoints-renaults-luca-de-meo-to-lead-gucci-french-high-fashion-brand-hopes-for-revival/articleshow/121890420.cms,"French high end fashion group Kering appointed Luca de Meo, the man behind rescuing carmaker Renault from crisis, as its new chief executive to steer the company’s struggling flagship brand Gucci back on course.De Meo, 58, will officially take over in September, after shareholders approve of a new governance structure that separates the roles of chairman and CEO. Francois-Henri Pinault, whose family controls Kering’s largest shareholder, will stay on as board chairman.Kering, which owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, described the appointment as “a decisive step in the evolution of Kering’s governance and strengthens the Group’s leadership as it enters a new phase of its development.”Kering’s shares surged nearly 12% on reports of de Meo’s imminent arrival, although the company only confirmed the news after the Paris exchange closed. In contrast, Renault shares dropped 8.7% on Sunday following the announcement that de Meo would step down on 15 July to ""take on new challenges outside the automobile sector.""Luca de Meo is known for turning struggling companies around. He joined Renault in 2020 after the Carlos Ghosn scandal and helped steady the business.He pushed for electric vehicles and focused on more premium models. As a result, Renault avoided the slump that affected rivals and is now aiming for an operating margin of over 7% this year.Kering is counting on de Meo to deliver a similar turnaround at Gucci, which has lost its edge in recent years. Once the group’s main driver of growth, the brand’s slump played a major role in Kering’s 12% drop in revenue to 17.2 billion euros in 2023, while net profit plunged by 64% to 1.1 billion euros. Over the year, Gucci’s own sales fell 23%.In February, Gucci parted ways with creative director Sabato De Sarno after a lacklustre two-year stint. In March, the group named Balenciaga's Demna Gvasalia as chief designer for Gucci, part of a wider leadership reshuffle that also included appointments at Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.Analysts are cautiously optimistic about de Meo’s appointment. Bernstein noted that “Kering shares have lost 28 percent since the beginning of the year and 78 percent since its peak in mid-2021, a drop largely due to the drop in its leading brand Gucci.”","Luca de Meo, 58, will officially take over in September.

These inflows to these countries made up just 2.3% of their GDP in 2023, roughly half of what they were at their peak in 2008.“What we're seeing is a result of public policy,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist. He further noted that public debt is reaching new highs while investment continues to fall.“In recent years governments have been busy erecting barriers to investment and trade when they should be deliberately taking them down.”The report also flagged a significant drop in new investment treaties, which were once a major driver of global capital flows. Only 380 new investment agreements came into force between 2010 and 2024, less than half the number signed between 2000 and 2009.World Bank deputy chief economist Ayhan Kose said turning this slowdown around “essential for job creation, sustained growth, and achieving broader development goals.”The bank also highlighted that FDI could boost economic growth significantly. Global economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk have soared to the highest level since the turn of the century,"" the report said, quoted by AFP.Moreover, FDI remains highly concentrated. Between 2012 and 2023, nearly two-thirds of flows went to just 10 countries: with China, India, and Brazil alone attracting almost half of all investment in emerging and developing markets.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.87% or 51.80 points, reaching 6,028.77 in early trading, recovering some ground after last week’s drop.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also followed a similar suit, soaring to 42,564.12, gaining 0.87% or 366.33 points at 7:20 pm IST.US stocks rose in early trade, and oil prices pulled back from Friday’s sharp spike, helping calm global market nerves after a volatile end to last week.The moves come after Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites late last week, prompting a surge of over 7% in oil prices on Friday. Iran, a key oil producer under Western sanctions, responded with a new wave of missile attacks on Israel early Monday. Despite the continued hostilities, markets were cautiously optimistic that the conflict might not spill over further, allowing oil prices to stabilise.US benchmark crude slipped 73 cents to $72.25 per barrel, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, also dropped 73 cents to trade at $73.50. Both remain at their highest levels this year, underscoring ongoing concerns over supply disruption if tensions worsen.Last week’s turmoil weighed heavily on sectors sensitive to fuel costs and consumer confidence. Carnival shares tumbled 4.9%, United Airlines lost 4.4%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings fell 5% on Friday. These losses were among the steepest as fears over high oil prices and dampened travel demand rattled sentiment.Gold also found favour among nervous investors, with the precious metal rising 1.4% on Friday and holding steady on Monday. Treasury bond prices, however, fell, pushing yields higher—driven partly by fears that oil-driven inflation could gather pace.Although inflation has recently hovered near the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, some traders remain wary.

US tariff effect: British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover trims FY26 margin forecast; Tata Motors shares fall 5%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariff-effect-british-carmaker-jaguar-land-rover-trims-fy26-margin-forecast-tata-motors-shares-fall-5/articleshow/121886676.cms,"British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) sharply lowered its earnings outlook for the next financial year, citing growing uncertainty in the global automotive market and new US tariffs that threaten to disrupt international sales.On Monday, JLR revised its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin forecast for fiscal 2026 to between 5% and 7%, down from its earlier target of 10%. The forecast is also below the 8.5% margin it reported for the year ended March 31.In another blow, the company also expected the free cash flow to hover near zero in the same period.The announcement sent shares of its parent company, Tata Motors, tumbling by as much as 5.2% in early trade, which ended the day at 3.56% on the BSE.Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has been hit by a downgrade as it deals with the impact of a new 25% tariff imposed by the US administration on all foreign-made vehicles. The United States, which makes up over a quarter of JLR’s global sales, is a key market for the company. In response, JLR has temporarily halted shipments to the US and is now diverting its stock to other international markets in a bid to safeguard profit margins.The maker of the 'Defender' SUV said it is redirecting available units to ""more accessible markets"" in an effort to maximise profitability.JLR said it remains in dialogue with both the British and American governments over a bilateral trade agreement signed in May, which allows the UK to export up to 100,000 cars annually to the US at a lower 10% tariff.While JLR’s Range Rover line is produced in the UK and eligible under this deal, its best-selling Defender SUV is made in Slovakia, part of the European Union, which does not yet benefit from the agreement.To soften the blow of the higher import costs, the company is also evaluating pricing strategies in the US market.Analysts noted that while Jaguar Land Rover’s high-end clientele might be less sensitive to price increases, the lack of US-based manufacturing makes Tata Motors one of the most vulnerable Indian automakers in the face of rising American import duties.In contrast, several of JLR’s key competitors, including Mercedes-Benz and BMW, have well-established manufacturing bases in the United States, giving them a significant cost advantage under the new tariff regime.","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has been hit by a downgrade as it deals with the impact of a new 25% tariff imposed by the US administration on all foreign-made vehicles.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

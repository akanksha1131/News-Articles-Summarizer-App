1) Effective Date:

2) Structure and Presentation:

3) Tax Year Concept:

4) Introduction of Taxpayer's Charter :

5) Simplified TDS /TCS Sections:

Conclusion



(Gaurav Mehndiratta is Partner and National Head, Corporate and International Tax, KPMG in India and Siddharth Kaul is Partner Corporate and International Tax, KPMG in India)

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : After the third term re-election of the Indian Government, in the Budget speech, the finance minister (FM) announced a comprehensive review of the Income Tax (IT) Act, focusing on four primary pillars: simplification of language, litigation reduction, compliance reduction, and elimination of redundant provisions. This promise was fulfilled when the IT Bill, 2025 (Bill) was presented in the Lok Sabha yesterday to replace the existing law which is more than 6 decades old.The Bill will take effect on April 1, 2026, allowing time for necessary consultations with stakeholders before its enactment which is a welcome move. The bill will first go to the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance for detailed examination before being enacted following the parliamentary approval process.The Bill's total word count is approximately 55% of that of the existing law. This reduction was achieved by eliminating obsolete sections, such as those related to the dividend distribution tax, fringe benefit tax, lapsed tax holidays, etc. Additionally, lengthy sentences have been broken down into clauses, tables to improve readability. Furthermore, provisions previously scattered across the existing law, such as those related to non-profit organizations, start-ups, etc are sought to be grouped more logically.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: 10 key takeaways for taxpayers - top points you should know The concept of an ""assessment year"" has been removed, with the term ""previous year"" now referred to as ""tax year."" This is intended to align with commonly used terminology in tax legislation in other countries.The Bill includes a taxpayer's charter to ensure transparency and fairness in tax administration. It is expected that CBDT will issue guidelines from time to time to the field formations for administration of the charter.The Bill merges all TDS/TCS related provisions in one place and provides simplified tables for category wise rates, thresholds etc. as against current complex and lengthy provisions.Recent beneficial changes introduced in budgets, such as streamlining TDS/TCS provisions, reducing income tax slab rates under the new regime, introducing three-year block assessment for transfer pricing matters, and providing additional timelines for filing updated returns, etc have all been included in the bill. Additionally, there are no changes in the tax rates. Further no new taxes are introduced or reinstated like equalization levy for non-resident e-commerce operators, etc.However, some wording changes provided in the Bill require detailed evaluation such as new methodology for interpretation of undefined terms in the treaties, interpretation of the term ‘information’ for reassessment of past years, certain simplified definitions, etc.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025: Read full text of proposed new I-T Act Although India's diverse economy rarely has a one-size-fits-all solution, the government's efforts to simplify the tax system and improve the ease of doing business are commendable. While no substantial amendments have been proposed, the overall simplification should benefit taxpayers in terms of ease of compliance and certainty of positions and to that extent, it should not be seen as a zero-sum game.However, a lot depends on administration once it becomes law. Detailed rules will be required for the smooth operation of the new law and additionally, it will be interesting to see how current judicial precedents, guidance, circulars and notifications, will apply in interpretation of the new law.","The Bill will take effect on April 1, 2026, allowing time for necessary consultations with stakeholders before its enactment. The Bill's total word count is approximately 55% of that of the existing law. No new taxes are introduced or reinstated like equalization levy for non-resident e-commerce operators, etc.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118245228,imgsize-71434,width-400,resizemode-4/118245228.jpg"

Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, Vedanta and International Gemmological Institute are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for February 14, 2025:The Index on Thursday’s session traded with high volatility and closed marginally lower. In the process extended decline for the seventh session in a row. In the daily chart it has formed a second consecutive doji candle highlighting indecision and higher volatility. On Wednesday, it has formed a long-legged doji candle, indicating that support is emerging from the previous major low.Going ahead, we expect the index to enter a base formation within the 23,600-22,800 range. A breakdown below the support level of 22,800 could trigger a further decline towards the 22,500-22,600 levels.We believe Nifty after 13% correction in the last five months is approaching both pricewise and time-wise maturity. Hence the current decline should be used to accumulate quality stocks backed by strong earnings from medium to long term prospective.Bouts of volatility cannot be dismissed due to concerns surrounding US tariff-related developments. Additionally, Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US will be an important event to watch.On the global macro front, amid concerns over tariffs, the US Dollar Index attempted but failed to break above the 110 mark and is currently trading near 107.5. Meanwhile, Brent crude has posted losses for the third straight week, trading around $75. A declining US Dollar Index and falling Brent crude prices are favorable for risk-on sentiment in emerging markets.Bank Nifty has relatively outperformed during the recent decline as it rebounded on Wednesday from the 61.8% retracement of the preceding up move 47844-50641.Going ahead, we expect the index to extend the last five weeks consolidation in the broad range of 50,500-48,000.The Bank Nifty in the last 5 weeks has been forming base around the lower band of 2 years rising channel indicating base formation. Thus, making us believe, that the index will continue to resolve higher and move towards the mark of 51600 in the short term being 61.8% retracement of previous fall (53888 -47844). In the process, 48700-38300 shall provide immediate support.Volatility is expected to remain at an elevated levels due to concerns surrounding US tariff-related developments.The stock is witnessing buying demand after forming base at the key support area of 410-400 thus offers fresh entry opportunity with a favorable risk-reward set up. The key support of 410-400 is the confluence of the 52 weeks EMA and the previous multiple lows of the last 7 months as can be seen in the chart.Among the oscillators, the weekly stochastic is in positive trend and has recently generated a buy signal thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 473 in the coming weeks being 61.8% retracement of previous major decline (526-410).The share price is rebounding after taking support at the falling trendline joining the lows of 27th December and 27th January thus offers fresh entry opportunity with favorable risk reward set up.The stock on Thursday session has generated a breakout above a falling channel of last 7 sessions signaling reversal of corrective trend. We expect the stock to head higher towards 525 levels in the coming weeks being the 80% retracement of the previous decline (542-439).",Bajaj Broking Research says Vedanta and International Gemmological Institute are the top stock picks for today. The index on Thursday’s session traded with high volatility and closed marginally lower. We believe Nifty after 13% correction in the last five months is approaching both pricewise and time-wise maturity.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118219053,imgsize-204026,width-400,resizemode-4/118219053.jpg"
Gaming industry will shut down if cos need to pay Rs 1.1 lakh crore in past GST demands: Dream11’s Jain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gaming-industry-will-shut-down-if-centre-continues-to-insist-on-rs-1-1-lakh-crore-in-gst-dream11s-jain/articleshow/118274245.cms,"NEW DELHI: Seeking an independent statutory regulator like Sebi to manage the affairs of the online gaming industry , Harsh Jain, the co-founder and CEO of the country’s most valuable gaming company Dream11, has said “the majority of companies will shut down” in case the Centre continues to insist on its notice to recover over Rs 1.1 lakh crore in GST demands, including those slapped retrospectively (stayed by Supreme Court on Jan 10).Dream11, which itself faces a Rs 28,000 crore GST demand, has said the over 400 gaming companies involved in the GST notices do not have more than Rs 10,000 crore with them to make up for the tax demand. “All the big financial numbers that you see for us are in terms of our valuations (at the time of fund raises). But valuations can’t pay taxes. The full industry will shut down if forced to pay the tax demand,” Jain told TOI.The GST Council had on October 1, 2023, imposed a 28% tax on the full face-value of player collections on online real-money gaming platforms instead of the previous 18% on the revenue of companies. In what made matters worse for the industry, the govt said that the tax will apply retrospectively, covering transactions from August 2017 to October 1, 2023.Jain, who had co-founded Dream11 in 2008 with Bhavit Sheth, says this demand is unviable and untenable.Dream11 had become a unicorn in April 2019, and was last valued at $8 billion when it raised funds in 2021. However, its financial numbers are a shade of the valuations. In fiscal FY23, Dream11’s parent Dream Sports had a consolidated revenue of Rs 6,581 crore (up 62% over Rs 4,065 crore), and profits of Rs 188 crore (up 32% over Rs 142 crore). However, its auditors had said then that the GST demand towards the company leads to a “material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern.”Jain said while the new GST rates are leading to a windfall for the govt, the industry is in a shambles. Moreover, the revenue and profitability of even the larger companies has been hit very badly, with not many avenues to gain from. “Govt’s collections went up from around Rs 3,000 crore (before the GST rate changes) to Rs 16,000-17,000 crore under the new GST rates and TDS. However, the industry’s revenue went down by 30-40%, and profits slipped by 60-70%.”He said even the venture capital funds dried up. “The VC money went away. Many companies have shut shop, and many lost jobs. While the Top 10 larger players are still profitable, their earnings are now down by 60-70%, and they accounted for around 90% of GST payments.”Jain said just like the creation of Sebi had led to a clean-up of the stock markets, there is a need for a similar independent body for gaming companies. “In any market, you’ll have people doing wrong things until regulators step in. We really hope that regulations come in gaming. We need a Sebi-like body for gaming. We’ve been waiting for regulations for almost two years. Hope the IT ministry starts working on this.”He said that rather than seeking higher GST collections from companies, the GST council should look at lowering rates for the platforms with the tax being charged on gross gaming revenue (GGR) and not on the full value of collections from players.Jain also spoke about offshore gaming companies, many of whom -- he claimed -- were operating illegally in the country, dodging govt taxes, and engaging in promoting betting rather than engaging in skill-based challenges.","Harsh Jain, co-founder and CEO of Dream11, said “the majority of companies will shut down” in case the Centre continues to insist on its notice to recover over Rs 1.1 lakh crore in GST demands.

NEW DELHI: Foreign investors have been offloading Indian equities at a rapid pace since the start of 2025, with total outflows now heading for the Rs 1 lakh crore mark.According to data by the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sold equities worth Rs 99,299 crore in just six weeks.The intense selling pressure continued in February, with FPIs withdrawing Rs 13,930.48 crore in the week from February 10 to 14 alone, bringing the net outflows for February to Rs 21,272 crore so far, following a massive Rs 78,027 crore sell-off in January.The shift in foreign investor sentiment is drastic as compared to December 2024, when they were net buyers, investing Rs 15,446 crore in the equity market. However, the net buying for the entire year reduced sharply to just Rs 427 crore.The relentless selling by foreign investors has sparked concerns among market participants. Analysts attribute this trend to a combination of global uncertainties, rising US bond yields, and geopolitical tensions.An important factor driving outflows is the US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, which has strengthened investor confidence in the American economy.Optimism around Trump's leadership and his pro-business stance have also made the US a more attractive investment destination.As a result, capital is flowing out of emerging markets, including India, as investors seek safer assets.The country saw a dramatic plunge in FPI inflows in 2024, with net investments collapsing by 99 per cent compared to the previous year.","Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sold equities worth Rs 99,299 crore in just six weeks.

Given the scale of the fraud, the case was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for further investigation.Mehta was earlier brought to the EOW office in south Mumbai for questioning.The complaint alleged that the head of accounts, Mehta conspired with his associates to deviate funds from the bank’s Prabhadevi and Goregaon branches.Police filed a case under Sections 316(5) (criminal breach of trust by bankers and public servants) and 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.The decision comes after the apex bank dissolved the cooperative bank's board for a year and appointed an administrator to oversee its operations on Friday.The RBI also imposed restrictions on withdrawals, citing serious concerns over the lender’s financial health and the need to protect depositors.New India Cooperative Bank operates 28 branches, majorly in Mumbai, with two in Surat and one in Pune.

New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained : The proposed Income Tax Bill, 2025 (‘new bill’) expected to come into effect on 01 April 2026, which will replace the existing Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘Act’), was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 13 February. Taxpayers are quite keen to understand how these changes will impact their tax matters and responsibilities.The new bill aims to simplify the current tax system by reducing the section count from 819 to 536 and reducing the word count by 40% to 50%. A significant number of explanations and conditions (provisos) have been removed.The new bill proposes the adoption of ‘tax year’ to eliminate confusion between terms like previous year (i.e., financial year) and assessment year. This will help provide clarity regarding tax payments, filing dates, and other compliance requirements. The tax year will generally run from 01 April to 31 March of the following year.Legal jargon and complex terms like ‘notwithstanding anything contained’ will be replaced with simpler language like ‘irrespective of anything contained.’ Formulas and tables have been added to clearly present key provisions, especially for salary perquisites, presumptive taxation and TDS/TCS rates. This move is designed to make the tax laws more understandable for taxpayers.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025: Read full text of proposed new I-T Act The residency laws continue to remain the same. The new bill keeps the current residency provisions intact, which classify individuals into three categories of residents: Ordinarily resident, Not-ordinarily resident and Non-resident, which is determined basis physical presence in India.The new Bill has proposed no change in heads of income compared to the existing Act. A welcome move in the new bill is the removal of many existing redundant provisions which have become obsolete over time.The new bill adds two new schedules, enhancing the total number of schedules to sixteen, to improve the organization of the new bill. Detailed sections from the current law have been moved to separate schedules for better clarity. However, the structure of twenty-three chapters, will remain unchanged for stability.Salary-related provisions are now consolidated in one section for easier understanding, eliminating the need for multiple references. Deductions like gratuity and leave encashment are now part of the salary chapter. Allowances like Leave Travel concession and House Rent allowance are included in Schedule II and III of the new bill. The goal is improved readability through tables and formulas.Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime Existing provisions for exempt income, previously detailed in Section 10, are now moved to separate schedules. This restructuring ensures that the tax laws are clearly defined and organized.Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) regulations will be simplified under the new bill making it more transparent and easier for taxpayers to understand and comply with TDS obligations. While this will require updates to forms and reporting tools after the new Income Tax Act is implemented, it will ultimately simplify the process for taxpayers. The new bill allows taxpayers to apply for lower or nil withholding tax certificates across all TDS/TCS provisions, rather than a select few, thereby reducing compliance burdens for taxpayersThe changes proposed in Budget 2025, such as the new rates for the concessional tax regime have also been incorporated in the new Bill.The Income Tax Bill, 2025 is a great start to simplify the existing Income Tax Act, 1961, which is more than six decades old and is expected to carry forward the spirit of ‘Nyaya’ as mentioned by the Finance Minister in her Budget 2025 speech. The new bill demonstrates the government's dedication to fostering a tax ecosystem that is both transparent and efficient.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay?

Why Print is the eternal muscle of advertising,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-print-is-the-eternal-muscle-of-advertising/articleshow/118265497.cms,"The Alchemy of print: Awakening desire

Brand experiences, like mornings, must feel fresh

Nostalgia, aspiration, and the power of print

Advertising without print is a body without a core

Let truth prevail.

The writer is CEO, The Times of India

Over the last few weeks, three major advertising agencies released their Advertising Industry Forecasts for 2025. Across all reports, one thing remains clear: while business decisions bow before data and analytics, very well presented across all three much awaited industry reports, advertisement is more of an art than a science driven by cold numbers. Human behaviour is driven by emotions, desires, and aspirations, which drives the art of advertising. The essence of advertising, therefore, is not in mere product placement, but in the alchemy of desire, the art of turning an offering into a myth that consumers long to be part of.But where do these desires begin? Not on the fleeting glow of a screen, not in the ephemeral swirl of social media, but in the tactile, immersive world of Print. The only medium one wakes up to, the only medium that awakens desire before the first sip of morning coffee.On a digital screen, rather than as an aspiration. But advertising is not about features; it is about longing, seduction, and storytelling.Consider the moment one unfolds a newspaper in the quiet of the morning. Unlike the frantic, ceaseless scrolling of digital, where headlines evaporate as quickly as they appear, print lingers, whispers, immerses. Its experience is not an accident — it is by design.Print possesses the two primal forces of aesthetic experience: sight and touch. The grand canvas of a broadsheet allows for narrative elegance — each advertisement is a story, unmarred by pop-ups, unhurried by the tyranny of the next notification. A well-crafted print ad does not beg for attention — it commands it. Unlike digital banners, which scream for a second’s worth of engagement, a print ad is a visual embrace, an invitation to linger. And therein lies its power: it builds desire not in a flash, but in a slow-burning flame that remains.Advertising thrives on freshness — the currency of memory. Infinite repetition in digital breeds indifference. The endless scroll of ads may create awareness, but it does not build longing. Print does not repeat — it reinvents. Every morning, it reintroduces the brand with a different story, a new aesthetic, a renewed call to desire. It nurtures the consumer’s relationship with the brand like a morning ritual — familiar, yet always full of possibility.To ignore this is to misunderstand the rhythm of consumer longing. A brand, like an enduring romance, must not demand attention — it must seduce, intrigue, and unfold itself in layers.Every consumer, whether they admit it or not, wants to do things history could only dream of. Every great brand taps into this primal longing for legacy, for transcendence, for a connection between past and future. And this is where Print wields its ultimate advantage.Unlike digital, ephemeral by nature, Print creates permanence. A beautifully designed newspaper spread does not vanish; it lingers on the table, it’s folded into memory, it’s clipped and saved. It invites nostalgia, but it also speaks to futures yet to be written.This is why advertising cannot simply sell a product; it must sell a desire. It must turn an object into a story, an experience into a destiny. The brands that live forever — high end phones, luxury watches, automobiles, premium real estate or that premium travel destination — do not sell transactions. They sell tradition, elegance, and the idea that to own their product is to belong to something greater.Only Print—with its immersive, unhurried storytelling—can give this myth the status it deserves.Advertising is an exercise of power, and power must be built on a strong core. While digital may flash its brilliance, while social media may spark momentary curiosity, Print remains the foundation. It is the core muscle of advertising — unseen, yet essential; silent, yet the very thing that holds everything together. Building awareness is simple; building longing is an art.Digital awareness is instantaneous, like quick commerce — integral to modern society but fleeting. It is the surface, the introduction, the passing wave. But desire — true, deep, soul-stirring desire — is cultivated slowly, rhythmically, until it becomes inseparable from the brand itself.This is the role of Print. It does not demand attention — it earns it. It does not fight for relevance — it possesses it. It does not fade — it becomes part of the morning, part of the ritual of being alive.Let other mediums chase the moment. Print creates eternity.All three major advertising agencies predict Print to have an 18% market share in 2025, with Auto, Real Estate, FMCG, Retail and Education being major spenders. But beyond predictions, our conviction is that new-age brands seeking to build longing, longevity and legacy will still turn to Print—because in branding, the core must always be strong.And in the end, the myth of the brand and the truth of the brand must become one.","Advertising is not about features; it is about longing, seduction, and storytelling. Unlike digital banners, which scream for a second’s worth of engagement, a print ad is a visual embrace, an invitation to linger. A well- crafted print ad does not beg for attention — it commands it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118265547,imgsize-97238,width-400,resizemode-4/118265547.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Wholesale price inflation eased marginally in Jan on the back of moderating food prices , indicating softening of price pressures as supplies improved.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Friday showed inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) rose an annual 2.3% in Jan, softening slightly from the 2.4% in December.Positive rate of inflation in Jan 2025 is primarily due to increase in prices of manufacture of food products, food articles, other manufacturing, non-food articles and manufacture of textiles, said an official statement from the ministry. Earlier data released by the NSO showed retail inflation , as measured by the consumer price index (CI), slowed to a five-month low in Jan, aided by a softening in food prices.The data showed inflation in food articles slowed to 5.9% in Jan from 6% in the previous month. Vegetable prices , which have been stubborn, softened to 8.4%, moderating from 28.7% in the previous month. Inflation in potatoes eased a tad, rising 74.3% from 93.2% in Dec, but onion prices strengthened 28.3% in Jan from 16.8% in the previous month.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut rates by 25 basis points earlier this month - the first cut in nearly five years. The decision was largely led by a softening in price pressures.","Inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) rose an annual 2.3% in Jan.

Bitter chocolate: High prices pinch pockets on Valentine's Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bitter-chocolate-high-prices-pinch-pockets-on-valentines-day/articleshow/118263021.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: For consumers, love may have come at a cost this Valentine's Day. Chocolates, the go-to gifting choice for the season have become more expensive on the back of soaring global cocoa prices, nudging several companies to take price hikes. This essentially means that the price increases which have been taken over the past few months have now hit the markets and consumers are paying more to buy the same pack of their favourite chocolate. Amul, for instance, took a price hike of about 20%-30% for its chocolates around August 2024. ""Global cocoa prices are trending at $10,000 per metric ton. We haven't seen such price rise in the last 50 years. The situation doesn't look good but we have to live with it,"" Jayen Mehta, MD at Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which owns the brand Amul, told TOI. The company remains watchful of the situation, Mehta said, not ruling out further price hikes if the situation warrants. Global cocoa prices which have been on the boil for quite some time due to scarce supply reached nearly $13,000 per metric ton in December last year, hitting a record high.Chocolate prices have surged by nearly 50% compared to Valentine's Day last year, said Ashwin Rathi, chief financial officer at Smoor Chocolates. The company said that it has recorded a 100% increase in raw material costs over the past year. ""While cocoa costs have nearly doubled, we have limited the price adjustment to only 30%-40% of the total increase. We have absorbed a significant portion (of the cost increase) to ensure our products remain accessible to our customers,"" said Rathi.For Indians who love to snack on chocolates, the rise in prices comes at a time when they have already been tightening their household budgets due to inflation.Global chocolate makers like Mondelez, Hershey's and Nestle have been grappling with rising prices of cocoa. In its recent earnings, Mondelez International, the maker of Cadbury chocolates termed the cocoa cost inflation as ""unprecedented."" The company said that if cocoa prices remain elevated, more price increases may be required in the second half of 2025 and in 2026, although the attempt will be to hold on to the price points of low unit pricing (low unit packs) in ""emerging markets"" (like India).","Chocolate prices have surged by nearly 50% compared to Valentine's Day last year.

Trump's tariff threats a negotiating tool: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-threats-a-negotiating-tool-experts/articleshow/118263079.cms,"Donald Trump (AP photo)

What are reciprocal tariffs?

Are

Indian tariffs

actually high?

How will reciprocal tariffs work?

So, what next?

What's the implication for the US?

US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose what he calls reciprocal tariffs on countries, such as China, Brazil, France, the European Union, India and others, to ""restore the fairness in US trade relationships and countering non-reciprocal trading arrangements"". The ""Fair and Reciprocal Plan"" ostensibly seeks to ""correct long-standing imbalances"" in global trade and ensure fairness across the board and make US industry competitive.There is nothing like reciprocal tariffs in global trade rules. It's a term coined by US president Donald Trump during his election campaign seeking to hit out at trade partners, such as India, which he asserts have high tariffs on products such as automobiles and alcohol. The idea is to match duties. In simple terms, if Country A sees that Country B places a 20% tariff on goods imported from A, then Country A might decide to match that same 20% tariff on goods it imports from B.A White House Fact Sheet says the average applied US tariff is 5%, compared to 39% in India. It also says that India charges 100% duty on motorcycles compared with 2.4% in the US. The numbers do not factor in the lower tariffs announced for motorcycles in the budget - 40% in completely built form. Besides, Trump is also being selective with facts. Some footwear items attract close to 40% import duty in the US, certain varieties of peanuts are taxed at over 54%, while a few textiles products, such as some of men's and boy's trousers, breeches and shorts face tariffs of 28%. And, the import duty on certain types of tobacco is 350%. While the US cries foul over high duties on alcohol in India, which faces upwards of 100% duty, this is because govt treats it as a sin good, just like tobacco.As for complexity, which India is often criticised for, here is a sample from the US tariff schedule: Certain wrist watches have a specific duty, up to $2.3 each, in addition to 6.25% tariff on the case and strap and 5.3% on the battery. In any case, govt officials and trade experts pointed out that India's duties are in line with commitments undertaken by it at the WTO, which provides developing countries the flexibility to levy higher duties to allow nascent industries to develop. In contrast the caps on tariffs for developed countries are much lower.Trump's statement early Friday only suggests a tit-for-tat action, although it is open to interpretation. The US commerce department will produce the list by April 1. It could mean that the U S authorities prepare item-wise import duty based on what each country levies on American products. The White House Fact Sheet talks about Brazil levying 18% duty on ethanol compared with 2.5% by the US. Or EU imposing 10% duty on imported cars against 2.5% in the US. Some experts also suggested that it could mean product category-wise duties. But all of this is speculation since no details have been spelt out.Trump's statements have in fact added more complexities. He wants to budget for subsidies, other trade barriers and VAT. Now, WTO agreement deals with subsidies separately and is subject to safeguard action. As for VAT, global trade rules allow countries to impose the same level of VAT or GST on a product, that is applicable to a domestically produced item. And, it is over and above customs duty.Most trade experts see Trump's threats as a negotiating tool to get countries on the table. Countries are waiting for more clarity to emerge and some are expecting a trade war with American trade partners responding through other action and challenging the decisions at WTO's dispute settlement body. But successive US presidents, starting with Barack Obama, have made the WTO's dispute mechanism defunct and there is not much hope there.Higher tariffs on imports means that prices in the US will go up, something that Trump admits is a possibility in the short-term. But for the medium-term, he is selling the great American resurgence story, ignoring that wages in the US are so high that it is tough for it to compete with countries where they are lower.","US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose what he calls reciprocal tariffs on countries.

Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, said that his team is working to finalize the details, with tariffs expected to be ready by April 2.

The measure is likely to reshape America's trade relationships and has already sparked reactions from major economies, including India.

Trump’s move follows his campaign promise to crack down on what he sees as unfair trade practices by other countries. He has long accused nations—including allies like India, Japan, and the European Union—of imposing higher tariffs on American products while benefiting from lower US duties.

Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security. A White House factsheet on Trump's “fair and reciprocal plan” on trade

How would reciprocal tariffs work?

Tariff imbalances: If a country imposes high tariffs on US imports, the US will match those levies on goods from that nation.

Non-tariff barriers: These include government subsidies, stringent regulations that disadvantage foreign companies, VATs, and exchange rate policies that artificially lower the cost of exports.

Sector-Specific Adjustments: Tariffs may apply to individual products, industries, or as an overall rate on imports from a particular country.

For instance, Brazil currently imposes an 18% tariff on US ethanol imports, whereas the US allows Brazilian ethanol in largely duty-free. Under the new policy, Washington could either raise its own tariffs on Brazilian ethanol or pressure Brazil to lower its duties. Similarly, the European Union charges a 10% tariff on vehicle imports compared to the US’s 2.5%, prompting Trump to label the EU’s trade policies as “absolutely brutal.”

Why it matters

The reciprocal tariffs policy is expected to have a widespread impact on global trade, particularly on emerging economies with high tariff rates, such as India. While the intention is to level the playing field, it could also lead to higher inflation in the US and economic slowdowns in affected countries.

For India, which enjoys a trade surplus with the US, the new policy could mean: Higher costs for Indian exporters, particularly in industries like pharmaceuticals, textiles, and information technology, which are heavily reliant on the US market.

Potential retaliatory tariffs from India, leading to a tit-for-tat trade war that could hurt both economies.

Increased pressure on India to lower its trade barriers, which could lead to long-term shifts in economic policy.

Trump’s order also considers non-tariff barriers, such as value-added taxes (VATs), regulatory policies, and currency exchange rates, which could complicate trade negotiations further.

India has been just about the highest tariff nation in the world...hard to sell to India because of very strong tariffs...whatever India charges, we charge them. US President Donald Trump

The big picture

The US-India trade relationship is currently valued at over $190 billion annually, with a $50 billion surplus in India’s favor.

India’s average tariff rate is around 17%, one of the highest among major US trading partners, compared to the US’s 3.3% average rate.

Under the new policy, tariffs could be adjusted country by country and product by product, meaning Indian goods could face increased duties based on existing disparities.

The US government's decision to impose reciprocal tariffs in response to higher duties from its trading partners is unlikely to have a significant impact on India due to differences in their export profiles, according to economic think tank GTRI on Friday.

The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) provided an example, stating that if the US imposes a 50 percent reciprocal tariff on Indian pistachios because India does the same, it would have little effect since India does not export pistachios.

Furthermore, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava noted that for 75 percent of US exports to India, the average tariff remains below 5 percent.

On the other hand, India faces steep US tariffs on many labor-intensive goods such as textiles, garments, and footwear, with rates ranging from 15 to 35 percent on several products, he added.

""Given the differences in the export profiles of the two countries, reciprocal tariffs may not have a significant impact...In the new Trump era, India may wait to see the US decision in April on reciprocal tariffs and then respond in equal measures as we did in June 2019,"" Srivastava said.

The US average applied Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff on agricultural goods is 5%. But India’s average applied MFN tariff is 39%. India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles. A White House factsheet on Trump's “fair and reciprocal plan” on trade

How it may impact India

1. Indian industries at risk

Pharmaceuticals: India is a leading exporter of generic drugs to the US, and higher tariffs could make Indian medicines less competitive in the American market.

Textiles: The US is one of the largest buyers of Indian textiles and garments. Increased duties could disrupt supply chains and affect Indian manufacturers.

Information technology: India’s IT sector depends on the US for business contracts, and while services are not directly affected by tariffs, trade tensions could spill over into tech policy.

Steel industry: According to a Reuters report, India's smaller steelmakers could be forced out of business by a further surge in imports resulting from sharp tariff increases imposed by Trump, industry executives warned.

""The increased tariffs may divert Chinese and other Asian exports to India while heightening competition, creating a downward pressure on domestic prices, and affecting small Indian producers with low-cost Chinese dumping,"" said Anubhav Kathuria, managing director of stainless steel producer Synergy Steels.

""We need to protect ourselves from other countries diverting steel to India because we do not have any safeguards,"" said one senior steel company executive, who did not wish to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

2. Trade deficit and tariff battles

Reducing tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a longstanding Trump grievance.

Dropping retaliatory tariffs on US almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils, and walnuts in 2023.

However, these moves may not be enough. Trump’s new policy could force India to make deeper concessions or risk losing access to the US market.

3. Potential retaliation from India

US agricultural products, such as soybeans and corn.

Energy exports, including oil and gas. India is a major buyer of US energy, and trade disputes could disrupt agreements.

Aerospace and defense deals, including purchases of Boeing aircraft and military equipment.

India has historically been cautious about trade wars, preferring to negotiate rather than escalate. However, if Trump's policies disproportionately hurt Indian businesses, pressure could mount on the Modi government to respond.

The leaders welcomed early steps to demonstrate mutual commitment to address bilateral trade barriers. The United States welcomed India’s recent measures to lower tariffs on US products of interest in the areas of bourbon, motorcycles, ICT products and metals, as well as measures to enhance market access for US agricultural products, like alfalfa hay and duck meat, and medical devices. India also expressed appreciation for US measures taken to enhance exports of Indian mangoes and pomegranates to the United States. Both sides also pledged to collaborate to enhance bilateral trade by increasing US exports of industrial goods to India and Indian exports of labor-intensive manufactured products to the United States. The two sides will also work together to increase trade in agricultural goods. India - US joint statement

Between the lines

Trump’s tariff move is as much about domestic politics as it is about trade. By pushing for tougher tariffs, he appeals to American manufacturing and agriculture sectors, which he sees as crucial for his re-election strategy.

India’s global trade strategy could shift as a result. With growing ties to the European Union, Middle East, and Southeast Asia, New Delhi may seek new trade agreements to offset US pressure.

The China factor: Trump’s tariffs have historically focused on China, but expanding them to other countries signals a broader protectionist agenda. India must navigate this carefully, balancing its own trade policies while maintaining strong US ties.

What’s next?

Trump’s tariff strategy could go in several directions:

Negotiation and compromise: India and the US could engage in talks to lower tariffs on both sides, preventing a full-scale trade war.

Gradual escalation: If the US raises duties, India might respond selectively, targeting politically sensitive sectors to push for a better deal.

Broader trade realignment: If tensions persist, India could explore alternative markets to reduce reliance on US trade.

India’s diplomatic approach will be key—whether it chooses to push back, negotiate, or make strategic concessions.

President Donald Trump signed an order on February 13 directing his administration to propose “reciprocal tariffs” on US trading partners, a move that could significantly impact global trade. The tariffs, expected by April, aim to match or offset tariffs and other trade barriers imposed on US goods by foreign nations.In trade terminology, “reciprocal” tariffs typically refer to policies ensuring that countries impose similar levies on each other’s goods, aiming for fairness in trade relations. Historically, reciprocity in trade often meant the mutual reduction of trade barriers to facilitate economic growth and global integration. The US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, for instance, marked a shift away from American protectionism, enabling the US and its trading partners to negotiate lower tariffs on each other’s products.However, the Trump administration sees the current global trade landscape differently. It argues that many US trading partners have maintained policies that disadvantage American businesses, whether through high tariffs, non-tariff barriers, or other regulatory practices. The administration asserts that these policies unfairly benefit foreign exporters while putting American manufacturers at a disadvantage.During Trump’s first term, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross floated the idea of raising US tariffs to match those of its trading partners. Under this “ideal” trade system, the US would lower its tariffs only if other nations did the same. The newly proposed reciprocal tariffs are expected to operate along these lines but with a broader scope, factoring in non-tariff barriers such as value-added taxes (VATs), exchange rate manipulations, and industrial subsidies.Unlike the blanket tariffs Trump previously considered, reciprocal tariffs would be tailored on a country-by-country basis. According to a White House memo distributed to trade officials, the policy will account for several elements beyond simple tariff comparisons. It aims to counterbalance:The impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India will be determined by how far the US goes in adjusting duties and how India responds.India has a trade surplus of around $50 billion with the US, meaning it exports more to America than it imports. Trump has repeatedly criticized this imbalance, arguing that it reflects unfair trade practices.India has already taken steps to ease tensions, such as:If the US imposes higher duties on Indian goods, India could retaliate with counter-tariffs on American exports. This could affect:(With inputs from agencies)","The measure is likely to reshape America's trade relationships and has already sparked reactions from major economies, including India. Trump’s move follows his campaign promise to crack down on what he sees as unfair trade practices by other countries. While the intention is to level the playing field, it could also lead to higher inflation in the US and economic slowdowns in affected countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118254628,imgsize-51032,width-400,resizemode-4/118254628.jpg"

It also imposed significant financial penalties on app store operators and internet hosting providers that continued to distribute or support TikTok.According to The New York Times, TikTok executives expressed optimism during a briefing call on Tuesday that Apple and Google would soon reinstate the app. H. Lee Justine, a TikTok creator and author who participated in the call, confirmed the statement.""They said that the administration had given them a lot of information that they wouldn't be penalized and that they were really hopeful that any day now they would put it back in the app stores,"" she said in an interview.""It makes me very hopeful that they felt that they could do this because hopefully this means that long term there's not going to be issues and this will work out,"" she added.Despite Apple and Google preventing new TikTok downloads, previously installed versions continued functioning normally on American devices.TikTok's reinstatement on app stores is a promising development, granting the company until early April to secure a buyer. This marks a dramatic turnaround—just a month ago, it faced a ban with strong bipartisan support in Congress.

US inflation picked up broadly at the start of the year, further undercutting chances of multiple Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year at the same time the Trump administration presses forward with tariffs. The monthly consumer price index rose in January by the most since August 2023, led by a range of household expenses like groceries and gas, as well as housing costs. Excluding often-volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core CPI climbed 0.4%, more than forecast, fueled by car insurance, airfares and a record monthly increase in the cost of prescription drugs.Inflation tends to come in higher in January, because many companies choose the start of the year to hike prices and fees. That pattern has been been exacerbated in the post-pandemic era, and several forecasters suggested that the jump in price growth last month won't be repeated going forward.Still, Wednesday's report serves as further evidence that inflation progress has at least stalled - if not in danger of being reversed. Combined with a solid labour market, it will likely keep the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future.","Consumer price index rose in January by the most since August 2023.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US central bank will be keeping its interest rates unchanged for now, citing inflation levels which fall above Fed’s 2 per cent target and a solid job market.Speaking before the Senate Banking Committee on the first of a two-day testimony, Powell hinted that the central bank would maintain its current policy stance, having already cut rates by a full percentage point in late 2024.“With the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,” he said.His comments come at a time when the Trump administration is introducing sweeping policy changes, including tariffs on steel and aluminium and significant reductions in government spending.The Fed is also conducting a second review of its policy strategies and communication tools, though Powell insisted this would not include changing the bank’s inflation target , despite calls from some economists to raise it.After the Fed’s last review in 2019, it shifted to an average inflation target of 2 per cent, which analysts argue resulted in its slow response to rising prices in 2021 and 2022. The central bank only began raising rates in March 2022 to curb inflation by making borrowing more expensive.At its December meeting, the Fed projected two rate cuts in 2025, thought the market analysts are now less confident. Morgan Stanley revised their forecast to just one rate cut next year, while futures markets suggested a single cut in July.Fewer reductions would mean continued high borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and auto loans, though mortgage rates are also influenced by movements in US Treasury yields.Fed Governor Adriana Kugler had earlier said that the labour market was “stable,” allowing policymakers more time to assess their next move.She also acknowledged that Trump’s proposed economic policies, including tariffs and immigration restrictions, could result in new inflationary pressures. Some economists warn of mass deportations that could shrink the labour force and drive wages higher, fuelling inflation.Others argue that Trump’s deregulation agenda might boost supply and lower prices.“The cautious and the prudent step is to hold the (Fed's key) rate where it is for some time,” Kugler said.Strong job growth suggested less urgency for the Fed to cut rates, a stark contrast to last September, when weak hiring prompted a steep half-point rate reduction amid recession fears.“The latest data bolsters our confidence that the Fed cutting cycle is over,” economists at Bank of America wrote in a note on Friday.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the US central bank will be keeping its interest rates unchanged.

"Amazon reports strong earnings for Q4, but stocks dip due to outlook for the 1st quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-strong-earnings-for-q4-but-stocks-dip-due-to-outlook-for-the-1st-quarter/articleshow/117998797.cms,"Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.

Trump’s crypto policies



Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Bitcoin dropped from around $105,000 on Saturday to about $92,000 on Sunday night. However, it later recovered to over $100,000 on Monday after Trump paused tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods.While bitcoin showed some recovery, other cryptocurrencies saw larger losses. Ethereum , dogecoin, and other digital assets declined sharply. Trump’s own meme coin traded at around $19 on Monday, about 75 per cent below its peak when he launched it before his second inauguration.“These are riskier cryptos than bitcoin,” Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency analyst was quoted as saying by news agency Associated. “But it’s a little surprising how big the gap is.”Financial markets also saw major shifts before the tariffs were set to take effect. Trump warned that Americans might feel “some pain” from the tariffs but said the move was necessary. He also suggested that tariffs on the European Union and possibly the United Kingdom could follow.Bitcoin was created in 2009 as digital cash outside government control. Over the years, it has become more mainstream, with its price movements now closely tied to tech stocks.Meme coins, a more volatile part of the crypto market, have also seen sharp declines. First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin, launched before Trump took office, is down nearly 90% from its highest value.Trump, who was once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now embraced digital assets. He has promised to make the US a leader in crypto and has appointed officials supportive of the industry.Despite recent declines, cryptocurrencies have gained value since Trump’s election. Bitcoin remains close to its record high of $109,000.","Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

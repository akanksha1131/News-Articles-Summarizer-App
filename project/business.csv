Platform metrics show strong traction

SoftBank-backed e-commerce firm Meesho will open its initial public offering on December 3, featuring a Rs 4,250-crore fresh issue of shares, according to the red herring prospectus filed on Thursday. The issue will close on December 5, while anchor investors will be allotted shares on December 2, PTI reported.Alongside the fresh issue, the IPO will include an offer-for-sale of 10.55 crore shares by existing investors. Early backers such as Elevation, Peak XV, Venture Highway and Y Combinator will offload part of their holdings through the OFS.Meesho said the funds raised will be deployed for cloud infrastructure investments, marketing and brand-building initiatives, inorganic expansion through acquisitions and other strategic plans, and general corporate purposes. The size of the issue and the company’s valuation will depend on the price band, which will be released on Friday.In FY25, Meesho connected more than 500,000 transacting sellers with 199 million annual transacting users, enabling 1.8 billion placed orders. The company’s Net Merchandise Value (NMV) rose 29 per cent year-on-year to Rs 29,988 crore in FY25, after growing 21 per cent in FY24.Meesho defines NMV as the cumulative checkout value of successfully delivered orders, including taxes. The metric is a key gauge of platform health as it reflects user adoption and repeat engagement, making it central to revenue, margin and cash-flow trends.On the financial front, Meesho reported a net loss of Rs 3,942 crore in FY25, driven largely by one-time exceptional items, including reverse flip tax and perquisite tax linked to its transition to a public structure.","SoftBank-backed e-commerce firm Meesho will open its initial public offering on December 3.

Implementation of the new labour codes is expected to deliver a Rs 75,000-crore consumption boost and raise the share of the formal workforce by at least 15 per cent, according to a research note by economists at SBI on Tuesday.The four codes, enforced from November 21, will also expand social security coverage to up to 85 per cent within the next three years and help reduce the unemployment rate by 1.3 per cent over the medium term, the note said, PTI reported.“With a saving rate of approx 30 per cent, the implementation will result in a consumption boost Rs 66 per person per day post-implementation. This could lead to an approx consumption boost of Rs 75,000 crore,” the SBI economists said.They added that the new framework will empower both workers and enterprises, creating a labour market that is “protected, productive and aligned with the evolving world of work.”SBI economists said India has around 44 crore unorganised workers, of whom 31 crore are registered on the e-Shram portal.Assuming 20 per cent of these workers transition into the formal payroll system, nearly 10 crore people would benefit — pushing social security coverage to 80–85 per cent in the next two to three years.Citing the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the note said 60.4 per cent of India’s workforce is currently formal. The bank expects formalisation to rise by 15.1 per cent under the new regime.The impact on unemployment will depend on “reform implementation, firm-level adjustment costs, and complementary state-level rules,” the report said.","The four codes, enforced from November 21, will expand social security coverage to up to 85 per cent within the next three years.

Benchmark indices advanced for the third straight week, with the Nifty hitting a new all-time high of 26,310 during Thursday’s session. The rally was fueled by positive global cues and rising expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Market sentiment further improved as crude oil prices eased on renewed optimism about a potential Ukraine–Russia peace agreement. Additionally, a lower India CPI inflation print boosted hopes of an RBI rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy review.A key point to note is that the index showed a much faster recovery this week, erasing the entire three-day decline in just one session and reinforcing the bullish momentum. Strong buying interest in heavyweight large-cap stocks fueled a sharp rebound, with market leadership clearly shifting toward major heavyweights.Going ahead we expect the index to maintain overall positive bias and gradually head towards 26,500 and then towards 26,800 levels in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the recent range breakout (26,100-25,400). The two-month uptrend has remained well within a rising channel, indicating sustained demand even at higher levels and reinforcing the positive bias for the index.The channel’s upper band also aligns near the 26,800 marks.Short-term support is positioned in the 25,800–25,700 zone, which aligns with the confluence of the 20- and 50-day EMAs, the lower band of the two-month rising channel, and the recent two-week lows. This makes it an important level to monitor from a short-term perspective, sustaining above the same will keep the bias positive.While the Nifty and Nifty Midcap indices have already touched new all-time highs, the Small Cap index remains about 9% below its peak. We expect a gradual catch-up in the small-cap segment in the coming weeks, supported by emerging buying interest near the 52-week EMA in the Nifty small cap index.Key Monitorables for the short term:Bank Nifty extended its rally for the fourth week in a row as it rallied to a fresh all time high of 59866 levels in Thursday session.The index rebounded in Wednesday session from the upper band of the recent range breakout area and closed firmly above the 59,500 levels. The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels.We expect the index to retain its positive momentum and move towards the 60,400 level in the coming sessions, based on the measuring implication of the recent range breakout. A move above that will open further upside towards 61,000 levels in the coming weeks Meanwhile, the 58,500 is likely to act as a crucial support area, with the previous resistance now expected to serve as support.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a bullish crossover above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias.The stock is witnessing buying demand after a base at the 100 days EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the previous up move (1022-1223) signaling strength.We expect the stock to move higher and head towards 1240 levels in the coming month being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline (1223-1104).The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias in the stock.The stock is rebounding from the support area of 480-470 being the confluence of the previous major lows and the trendline support joining the lows of October 2024 and February 2025,We expect the stock to resume up move and head towards 535 levels in the coming month being the 80% retracement of the recent breather (557-474)The daily stochastic has rebounded from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal thus supporting the positive bias in the stock.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 28, 2025 are JSW Steel, and JSW Energy.

Banking Connect: NPCI Bharat BillPay launches new system for online payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/net-banking-upgrade-rbi-gets-real-time-view-via-new-platform-tighter-oversight-on-risky-sectors/articleshow/125615997.cms,"Big push to expand digital bill-payments

Banking Connect- the newly launched net-banking platform built by NPCI Bharat BillPay (NBBL) - will enable the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to monitor fund transfers in shorter-lag, a senior official said on Thursday.NBBL is aiming for a fourfold jump in monthly bill-payment volumes to 1 billion transactions in four years, up from the current 260 million, managing director and CEO Noopur Chaturvedi told reporters, according to PTI.Chaturvedi said a live, instantaneous view of transfers routed through Banking Connect will significantly strengthen regulatory oversight. “A shoter-lag view of transactions will help the RBI monitor fund flows to sectors such as cryptocurrency and gaming,” she said.At present, banks send net-banking transaction data to the RBI with a lag — typically a week, and in some cases up to a year, she said. The regulator has consistently flagged concerns around private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and the government has tightened rules around money gaming.The new platform is also designed to minimise fraud by flagging suspect transactions faster. However, social-engineering scams - where customers are tricked into sharing sensitive information - remain difficult to contain, she added.Banking Connect aims to fix gaps in existing payment systems, especially since net banking is still used predominantly for merchant payments. The platform supports interoperability and follows a mobile-first design.Six banks and several payment aggregators have already joined, with efforts underway to onboard the top five banks by net-banking volumes within a month.Created by NBBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of NPCI, the platform went live last month. Currently, around 80 million customers use net banking, executing nearly 300 transactions a month, with monthly value exceeding Rs 6 lakh crore.While UPI continues to grow at a rapid clip, net-banking usage has been expanding at single-digit rates, Chaturvedi said.NBBL now wants to lift household adoption of digital bill-payments significantly. “About 70 million households are using the facility today. We are targeting over 135 million - roughly half of all Indian households,” she said.","NBBL is aiming for a fourfold jump in monthly bill-payment volumes to 1 billion transactions in four years.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold futures on MCX traded steady near ₹1,25,540, consolidating within a tight range after recent sessions of sideways movement. Despite low volatility, the underlying technical structure continues to suggest a bullish bias, as short-term momentum remains supported by the moving averages. The setup indicates a buy-on-dips opportunity near ₹1,25,500, with the bias staying positive above ₹1,25,350.The 8 EMA continues to hover slightly above the 21 EMA, maintaining a mildly bullish crossover that supports buying on declines. A sustained move above ₹1,25,850 could trigger fresh upside momentum toward higher resistance levels.Gold prices are trading close to the mid-Bollinger band, suggesting a consolidation phase. The lower band, placed near ₹1,25,400–₹1,25,500, serves as strong intraday support where fresh buying interest is likely to emerge.The RSI is currently around 47, reflecting neutral momentum but with scope for recovery. A move above 50 on the RSI scale would reinforce a bullish continuation.The MACD line remains close to the signal line, showing a potential for upward crossover as consolidation continues. This suggests that momentum could build once price sustains above ₹1,25,850.Gold’s intraday technical setup reflects a steady bullish bias, supported by short-term moving averages and a potential MACD crossover. With the RSI stabilizing near mid-range and Bollinger Band support intact, traders are advised to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy around ₹1,25,500, keeping a stop-loss below ₹1,25,250 and targeting ₹1,25,850–₹1,26,200. Sustained trade above the upper band may further extend gains toward ₹1,26,450 in the near term.","Gold prices are exhibiting a bullish bias, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 was above 26,200, BSE Sensex was near 85,750. At 9:27 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,219.45, up 4 points or 0.015%. BSE Sensex was at 85,750.14, up 30 points or 0.035%.Technical analysts indicate 26,300 as crucial resistance and breakout point. A definitive close above this threshold could potentially lead to new peaks in the 26,350–26,450 range.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The important takeaway from the new records set by Nifty and Sensex yesterday is that these are new records driven by a narrow rally in a limited number of performing largecaps. Despite the market at new highs, majority of retail investors, particularly the newbies who rushed into the market after the Covid crash in March 2020, are holding portfolios which show losses. This paradox is due to the retail investors’ obsession with smallcaps and their belief that smallcaps will outperform irrespective of their valuation. If retail investors have to participate in the rally expected in 2026, to be driven primarily by higher earnings growth, they will have to invest in largecaps and quality midcaps with growth potential.“Even though Sensex and Nifty touched new highs yesterday, the Nifty Smallcap Index is around 9 % below its peak. This huge underperformance is primarily due to the poor earnings growth and high valuations of this segment. Smallcaps, in general, are likely to continue underperforming, in the short- to medium-term.”Brent crude remained steady on Friday whilst market participants observed Russia-Ukraine peace talks developments and anticipated Sunday's OPEC+ meeting results regarding future supply adjustments that have been affecting market conditions.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 1,255 crore net on Wednesday.

Cyber security rules: DoT withdraws duplicate notification; original telecom security amendments stay in force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cybersecurity/cyber-rules-dot-withdraws-duplicate-notification-original-telecom-security-amendments-stay-in-force/articleshow/125616390.cms,"Cyber fraud crackdown at core of amended rules

Stronger data-sharing norms to track telecom-linked fraud

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on Thursday withdrew a duplicate Gazette notification issued last month, clarifying that the amended Telecommunication Cyber Security (TCS) Rules, 2025 - notified on October 22 - remain fully in force.The clarification came after the same TCS amendment notification was inadvertently republished on October 29 in place of a different rule meant for public consultation. The error was rescinded through notification GSR 863(E) on November 25, PTI reported.“This error now stands rectified… and this rescindment in no way invalidates the original amendment to TCS Rule that brought it into effect in the first place,” the DoT said in a statement.The amended TCS framework targets rising cyber vulnerabilities stemming from the deep integration of telecom identifiers — mobile numbers, devices, and other telecom resources — into digital services such as banking, e-commerce and e-governance.A key measure is the creation of a Mobile Number Validation (MNV) platform aimed at curbing the surge in mule accounts and identity fraud. The decentralised, privacy-compliant mechanism will allow service providers to verify whether a mobile number genuinely belongs to the person whose credentials are on record, strengthening trust in digital transactions.The updated rules also tighten scrutiny of the booming second-hand device market. Entities dealing in resale or refurbished devices must scrub every handset’s IMEI against a centralised blacklist before resale — a move intended to counter the circulation of cloned, stolen or blacklisted phones and protect consumers from legal exposure.Under the amended TCS rules, banks, e-commerce platforms and other telecom identifier user entities may be required to share relevant telecom-identifier data with the government under regulated conditions. The DoT said this is aimed at improving traceability, accountability and coordination in combating telecom-enabled cyber fraud, while maintaining compliance with data protection norms.According to the department, the amendments collectively seek to “safeguard India’s digital ecosystem against telecom-enabled frauds, strengthen device traceability, and ensure responsible use of telecom identifiers.” The TCS Amendment Rules, 2025, it added, mark a “decisive step” toward a more resilient and future-ready telecom cyber security framework.","The amended Telecommunication Cyber Security (TCS) Rules, 2025 - notified on October 22 - remain fully in force.

Gold-backed lending glows in banks' retail books: RBI data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-backed-lending-glows-in-banks-retail-books-rbi-data/articleshow/125649618.cms,"(AI image)

MUMBAI: Loans against gold jewellery have become the unlikely star of retail credit with outstanding balances in this category surging 128.5% year-on-year to Rs 3.38 lakh crore in Oct 2025 and 63.6% since March 2025. Gold loans now account for nearly a fourth of the addition to the bank's personal loan book in the last 12 months.Personal loans, already the engine of credit growth, rose 14% over the year to Rs 64.56 lakh crore in end Oct. RBI, which published the latest sectoral deployment data on Friday, said that part of the jump in gold loans was because of a reclassification by banks in May 2024 that shifted agricultural loans secured by jewellery into the retail gold-loan bucket in line with regulations.The boom in personal loans continues to rest on secured borrowing. Housing loans increased 11% year-on-year to Rs 31.87 lakh crore, vehicle loans 12.5% to Rs 6.77 lakh crore and education loans 14.7% to Rs 1.49 lakh crore. The unsecured end of the retail market grew slower in single digits. Consumer-durable loans inched up 1% to Rs 23,646 crore, credit-card outstandings grew 7.7% to Rs 3.03 lakh crore and other personal loans rose 9.9% to Rs 16.17 lakh crore.Retail demand continues to prop up bank credit, which grew 11.3% year-on-year to Rs 193.9 lakh crore in Oct 2025 and 6.3% in the seven months since March. Non-food credit, which represents almost all lending, increased at a similar 11.1% to Rs 193.2 lakh crore.Among non-retail sectors, services remain the driver. Lending to the sector climbed 13% year-on-year to Rs 53.45 lakh crore, powered by sharp gains in computer software (29.4%), shipping (28%) and commercial real estate (14.1%). NBFCs continue to attract banks: exposure rose 10.9% to Rs 17.04 lakh crore, with public financial institutions expanding faster than housing finance companies.Industry credit grew 10% year-on-year to Rs 41.93 lakh crore largely powered by micro and small firms which saw lending jump 25.9% to Rs 9.54 lakh crore, credit to medium enterprises rose 17.6% to Rs 3.98 lakh crore and large companies only 4.6% to Rs 28.41 lakh crore. Credit appetite remains restricted in the lower rungs of the corporate pyramid, with top corporates raising funds from bonds, equities and external commercial borrowings which are not reflected in bank numbers. Lending to agriculture and allied activities was steadier, up 8.9% to Rs 24.03 lakh crore.In priority-sector renewable energy, lending rose 52.1%, priority housing 32.7% and micro and small enterprises 25.8%. Social-infrastructure lending shrank and export credit contracted.","Gold loans account for nearly a fourth of the addition to the bank's personal loan book in the last 12 months.

Now we can state comfortably that the full year growth will be either 7% or to the north of that, rather than to the south of that,"" Nageswaran said after the numbers were released by the National Statistics Office.Sharing his assessment of the economy, Nageswaran said that the momentum is expected to continue across sectors - agriculture, manufacturing and services - on the back of healthy harvest, strong rural and urban demand, low inflation and the boost provided by tax cuts, both direct and indirect taxes.""Improving price dynamics and tax reforms are expected to boost household disposable incomes, strengthening the near-term consumption outlook.

The confluence of stable inflation, sustained public capex, and reform momentum positions the economy to navigate risks, as reflected in upward revisions to FY26 GDP growth projections by various agencies,"" Nageswaran said in a presentation.The third quarter (Oct-Dec) of the current fiscal year has commenced on a sound footing, CEA said while pointing to indicators such as e-way bills generated, a pick-up in non-food credit, growth in energy consumption and freight movement.Rural consumption continued to strengthen, driven by favourable agricultural incomes on the back of healthy crop output, he said.In Oct 2025, tractor sales reached the highest level for any month in the past eleven years, supported by favourable monsoon conditions, improved rural sentiment, festive demand and the recent GST rate reduction, he said, adding retail sales of two and three-wheeler vehicles recorded the highest growth in Oct.On the price situation, Nageswaran said, core inflation remains stable, while timely rabi sowing and healthy reservoir levels reinforce a benign food supply outlook. He also said that the recently-notified new labour codes will help build a future-ready workforce and resilient industries.","The growth estimates are higher than the 6.3-6.8% projected in the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament ahead of the Budget. The momentum is expected to continue across sectors - agriculture, manufacturing and services - on the back of healthy harvest, strong rural and urban demand.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125649656,imgsize-829351,width-400,resizemode-4/v-anantha-nageswaran.jpg"

‘Pvt consumption main driver of higher growth’

NEW DELHI: The Indian economy grew 8.2% in the July-Sept quarter as a strong comeback by the manufacturing sector and robust services activity helped it clock the fastest pace of expansion in six quarters.Strong domestic demand, which drove factories to produce more ahead of the festival season, helped India remain the fastest growing major economy and shrug off the impact of US tariffs.“The 8.2% GDP growth in Q2 of 2025-26 is very encouraging. It reflects the impact of our pro-growth policies and reforms. It also reflects the hard work and enterprise of our people. Our govt will continue to advance reforms and strengthen Ease of Living for every citizen,” PM Narendra Modi posted on X.Combined with 7.8% growth during April-June, the economy expanded at 8% during the first half of the year, with economists and policymakers expecting a good third quarter on the back of strong sales post GST rationalisation.“Now we can comfortably say full year growth will be 7% or north of 7%,” chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said after the data was released. Govt had budgeted for 6.5-6.8% GDP growth during the financial year.Apart from GST, the govt is also banking on reform measures such as the new labour codes to boost sentiment and further spur economic activity in the months ahead, with low inflation and falling interest rates adding to the positive sentiment.Manufacturing posted a sharp turnaround, clocking 9.1% growth in the second quarter of the current financial year, with service sectors seeing faster expansion. Construction too grew 7.2%, although a tad slower than July-Sept 2024. Agriculture too reported a 3.5% increase on the back of a 4.1% expansion in Q2 of the last fiscal year.Crisil chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi said, “Private consumption was the main driver of higher real growth. From the supply side, manufacturing and services saw a significant rise. There was a prop from statistical low-base effect as well, as the economy grew at a below-average 5.6% in the same quarter last fiscal. A low deflator also lent some buoy. Inflation based on both the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index were lower in the second quarter compared with the first. Lower food inflation stoked discretionary spending.”The higher-than-expected estimates prompted economists to revise their forecasts for the full year. State Bank of India is projecting 7.6% growth this year, while Crisil upped its projection by half-a-percentage point to 7%, while cautioning against the impact of US tariffs in the second half.“Impact of tariff has started reflecting in exports growth, which grew 5.6% in Q2 on a weak base of 3% growth in 2QFY25. On the other hand imports grew 12.8% in 2QFY26,” said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research.“Going forward the headwind will be the tariff impact which will get starker in Oct-Nov. The tailwind is the GST push which can negate and go beyond. This needs to be monitored going ahead,” added Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.Now, all eyes are on the monetary policy committee led by RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra, which meets next week, to decide on interest rates amid low inflation and strong economic growth.","Manufacturing posted a sharp turnaround, clocking 9.1% growth in the second quarter of the current financial year.

A public listing will give the company more credibility, allow it to attract better talent and get more sellers on its platform which competes with Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart even though an IPO will also bring forth new responsibilities, said Aatrey.The company's Rs 5,421 crore IPO opens for bidding on Dec 3. Meesho is raising up to Rs 4,250 crore through a fresh issue of shares while a clutch of investors including Peak XV Partners, Elevation Capital and Y Combinator are collectively selling 10.5 crore shares.At the upper end of the IPO price band set at Rs 111 per share, the implied valuation of Meesho is $5.6 billion (Rs 50,096 crore), lower than its initial targets pegged at close to $10 billion and only marginally higher than its peak valuation of $5 billion.""It's much easier for a listed company to go, offer esops to employees to come on board compared to a private company.

"What do new labour codes mean for employees & employers? From minimum wages, gratuity benefits to appointment letters & layoff rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-do-new-labour-codes-mean-for-employees-employers-from-minimum-wages-gratuity-benefits-to-appointment-letters-layoff-rules-top-things-to-know/articleshow/125545231.cms,"The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensure worker safety, extend social security benefits to gig workers. (AI image)



Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

These new labour codes will replace 29 existing labour laws. These codes are:

The Code on Wages, 2019

The Code on Social Security, 2020

The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020

The Industrial Relations Code, 2020

Result of Rationalizing Labour Laws

What should employees know about the new labour codes?

There will now be separate classifications for 'employee' and 'worker', with different benefits allocated to each category.

A 'worker' means someone who belongs to the 'workman' category from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, including individuals who perform manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical, or supervisory duties.

It excludes those in 'supervisory', 'managerial', or 'administrative' positions. Whilst the earlier legislation primarily addressed industrial disputes and retrenchment, the current definition has expanded considerably.

Workers will receive specific entitlements, including overtime compensation and leave encashment, as per the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020. Regulations regarding working hours, annual leave, and standing orders apply specifically to 'workers'.

The codes bring in a unified 'wages' definition across all four sections. Earlier, multiple interpretations of 'wages' and 'salary' created difficulties in benefit calculations, which then resulted in inconsistencies and even legal disputes.

This 'wages' definition now applies to calculations for Gratuity, Employees' State Insurance, Leave Encashment, Overtime, Statutory Bonus, and other benefits. This standardisation aims to improve compliance through greater clarity.

Fixed term employees will get all benefits equal to permanent workers. This includes leave, medical, and social security. They will be eligible for gratuity after just one year, instead of the current five. Additionally, they will get equal wages as permanent staff, increasing income and protection.

To put it simply, gig workers and the unorganized sector will finally see social security benefits.

The new labour laws allow for companies that employ fewer than 300 workers to do layoffs and retrenchments without seeking prior governmental approval.

What are the key provisions of the new labour codes?

What do the new labour codes mean for employers?

Evaluate employment roles: Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work.

Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work. Assess the impact of the definition of ‘wages’ on employees’ salary structure: Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’

Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’ Analyze cost implications: Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization.

Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization. Reassess hiring models: Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment.

Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment. Align HR and Payroll policies: Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations.

Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations. Establish a robust compliance framework: Implement strong internal controls, conduct periodic diagnostic reviews, and ensure effective governance

New labour codes 2025: The Narendra Modi government has introduced what experts are calling a significant reform in labour laws with the implementation of four comprehensive labour codes. These new labour codes are effective November 21, 2025. The new labour codes impact both employers and employees. The new laws mean some big benefits for workers - universal minimum wages, gratuity benefits, social security coverage, provisions for women to do night shifts, recognition of gig economy workers, formal appointment letter requirement etc. However, some provisions also raise employment security issues.The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensuring worker safety, extending social security benefits to gig workers, and guaranteeing timely wage payments, while establishing minimum wage standards.At the same time, the new codes provide businesses increased operational flexibility whilst maintaining regulatory certainty, particularly important given current global economic challenges. Outdated labour laws have in the past deterred foreign investment in India's manufacturing sector, with companies often favouring countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh for their production facilities.Government officials indicated that rules for the four codes - covering wages, industrial relations, social security, and occupational safety and health - would be implemented within 45 days.Following their notification by 2020, the actual implementation had remained pending. The government has now officially announced the implementation. Whilst the final implementation rules from central and state governments are awaited, they are anticipated to be released soon.As Arvind Panagariya, Chairman of 16th Finance Commission wrote in TOI, “The importance of the four codes lies in breaking the ice. For the first time since the launch of reforms, they have removed the first set of hurdles in the way of creating high productivity jobs in large numbers.”These consolidated labour codes aim to streamline the existing laws, enhance digital compliance, improve workforce management systems, and strengthen worker protection along with facilitating business operations.EY is of the view that the implementation of the labour codes is a significant and long-awaited initiative by the government. “These codes are poised to impact nearly every function within organizations, given the extensive changes they introduce,” it says.“However, it may also result in increased costs for organizations due to wider scope of the definition of wages. There are still ambiguities regarding coverage of different components of salary within the definition of wages (such as coverage of performance bonuses / one-off payments, etc.),” notes EY in a note on the new Labour codes.The new labour laws restrict contract labour usage in organisations' 'core activities', barring specific exceptions. Core activity includes the main purpose of establishment creation and includes essential operations necessary for such activities.Additionally, fixed-term employment has received formal recognition as a legitimate employment arrangement, but it is contingent upon some conditions and regulatory requirements.The regulations also authorise states to implement adaptable work arrangements. Certain states, including Haryana and Odisha, have incorporated flexible working provisions in their draft regulations, permitting organisations to implement four-day work schedules, notes EY.EY notes that the labour codes significantly affect various aspects of HR and payroll policies. “Certain provisions overlap with existing state-specific Shops and Establishments laws, which are not superseded by the labour codes, potentially leading to conflicts, especially concerning working hours, leave, and related issues,” it says.Organizations operating in multiple states may have to ensure compliance with both sets of laws in each jurisdiction. Additionally, since specific provisions apply only to 'workers,' organizations may need to implement different policies for various employee categories, it adds.The new labour legislation also authorises both the central and state governments to create and execute welfare programmes for platform workers, gig economy participants, and unorganised sector employees.This can include life insurance, disability protection, healthcare provisions, maternity support, retirement security and any associated benefits.For gig worker social security arrangements, platform aggregators are required to contribute between 1-2% of their yearly turnover to the social security fund. This is subject to 5% of the amount paid or payable by an aggregator to gig workers, to the social security fund.This is a change from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which had set this limit at 100 workers. According to EY, the move offers businesses greater workforce management flexibility to adapt to market conditions.Additionally, the regulations also introduce a 're-skilling' fund to support any laid off workers in acquiring new skills. “For every retrenched worker, the employer is required to contribute 15 days’ last drawn wages (or any other amount notified by the central government) to a fund to be called the worker re-skilling fund,” explains EY.According to EY, It is essential for organizations to thoroughly assess the implications of these changes and prepare for a smooth transition to ensure compliance and operational efficiency. It suggests the following for organizations:The effectiveness of the new labour laws will substantially be dependent on state-level implementation, workforce education, and robust compliance monitoring.","The Narendra Modi government has introduced what experts are calling a significant reform in labour laws.

Holiday rush: US retailers eye Black Friday lift; shoppers hunt deals despite weak sentiment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/holiday-rush-us-retailers-eye-black-friday-lift-shoppers-hunt-deals-despite-weak-sentiment/articleshow/125642803.cms,"Black Friday no longer pulls Americans from Thanksgiving dinners for midnight mall queues, but it still draws more in-store traffic than any other day of the year — and remains the unofficial start of the US holiday shopping season.This year’s kickoff came as US consumer confidence slipped following the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to The Conference Board, AP reported. Retailers say shoppers have grown more selective and deal-focused, even as they continue to spend on big seasonal moments, creating what executives describe as a “halo effect”.“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said ahead of Black Friday.At Macy’s Herald Square in New York City, early-morning crowds searched for steep discounts on shoes, clothing, linens and cosmetics after doors opened at 6 a.m. Footwear — marked down by 40–50% — was among the busiest sections. But unlike in past years, the atmosphere was calm.Veronica Nam, 68, picked up Nike sneakers for her husband and spent $256 on Lacoste bedding she estimated was half-price. She said she would wait until after Christmas to buy gifts for other relatives amid fluctuating tariffs under President Donald Trump and several years of elevated prices.“Food is very expensive,” she said.Nearby, 19-year-old Nicholas Menasche was shopping with his mother before heading to Best Buy for video games. The banking intern plans to spend around $1,200 this holiday season — roughly the same as last year. “I’m here to buy stuff. Shoes and clothes,” he said. “It’s a great tradition. The stores are open really early.”Retailers spent spring and summer navigating tariff unpredictability, shifting shipments ahead of import taxes and absorbing some costs to avoid raising prices. Circana data showed 40% of general merchandise in September saw price hikes of at least 5% versus early 2025. Toys, housewares, baby products and sports gear were especially affected; 83% of toys saw at least a 5% price rise. Nearly 80% of US toy sales involve items made in China — a sector hit with steep Trump-era tariffs.Still, malls and analysts reported strong momentum heading into Black Friday. At Minnesota’s Mall of America, foot traffic has exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels in recent weeks, said Jill Renslow, the mall’s chief business development and marketing officer. “We’re seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” she said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”Online spending is also growing briskly. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 23, consumers spent $79.7 billion, Adobe Analytics said — up 7.5% from a year earlier and ahead of its 5.3% forecast.Mastercard SpendingPulse projects holiday sales from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 will rise 3.6%, compared with last year’s 4.1%.“Clearly, there’s uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn’t seem like it’s changing how they are showing up for this season.”","Black Friday draws more in-store traffic than any other day of the year.

Growth rebound: Canada posts 2.6% Q3 GDP surge; stronger trade and govt spending drive recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/growth-rebound-canada-posts-2-6-q3-gdp-surge-stronger-trade-and-govt-spending-drive-recovery/articleshow/125640734.cms,"India, Canada Restart Trade Talks, Aim For $50-Bn Trade By 2030 As Pm Modi Meets Mark Carney

Canada’s economy staged a stronger-than-expected recovery in the third quarter of 2025, expanding 2.6 per cent year-on-year after a contraction in the previous quarter, according to new data from Statistics Canada, AFP reported.The rebound was fuelled by an improved trade balance and higher government spending, offsetting the drag from US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has weighed on Canadian growth and clouded the country’s trade outlook.CIBC economist Katherine Judge said the print “was well above the consensus forecast,” noting that analysts had broadly expected growth of around 0.5 per cent.Statistics Canada said the improvement was led by declines in imports alongside a slight uptick in exports. “Imports dropped and exports edged up. Increased capital investment was driven by government capital spending, as business investment was flat,” the agency said.The drop in imports was the largest since 2022, the agency added.A sharp rise in federal outlays also contributed to the growth momentum, with government spending on weapons systems surging 82 per cent. Since taking office in March, Prime Minister Mark Carney has prioritised upgrading Canada’s ageing military hardware, arguing that significant investments are essential for meeting NATO spending targets and safeguarding sovereignty amid rising threats, including from Russia in the Arctic.","Canada's economy staged a stronger-than-expected recovery in the third quarter of 2025, expanding 2.6 per cent year-on-year.

German chemical major Wacker Chemie on Thursday announced plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce, as the industry faces one of its toughest periods in decades.The company said most of the reductions will take place in Germany, with the process to be completed by the end of 2027, according to AFP.The job cuts form part of a broader plan to save more than 300 million euros ($348 million) annually. Wacker employs around 16,600 people worldwide, most of them based in Germany. Its customer base spans the automotive, construction and semiconductor sectors — all of which have been hit by slowing demand and rising competition.Shares of Wacker Chemie rose nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt after the announcement.Chief executive Christian Hartel said the operating environment for chemical firms in Germany needed urgent improvement. “The excessively high energy prices and bureaucratic obstacles continue to act as a central brake on the successful development of the chemical industry,” he said.The company had reported a net loss of more than 80 million euros in the third quarter, citing weak demand and mounting competition, particularly from China.Earlier this month, Germany’s VCI chemical industry association warned that production in the sector had slipped to a three-decade low, reflecting the broader strain on traditional industries as the country struggles to emerge from two years of recession.","Wacker Chemie announces plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce.

Hong Kong Fire Out Of Control: Over 100 Casualties, Hundreds Missing; 3 Held For Manslaughter

China Taiping's insurance exposure



'Seriously underinsured'

China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project linked to a devastating high-rise fire that has killed at least 44 people and left hundreds missing.The stock slid as much as 8.1% in early trading before trimming losses to about 2% by late morning in Hong Kong. Firefighters continued battling the massive blaze on Thursday, nearly 18 hours after it tore through parts of the densely populated Wang Fuk Court estate in Tai Po.The disaster was the city's worst fire in decades, which erupted suddenly on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed several sections of the 32-storey complex, home to roughly 2,000 units.Authorities have arrested three men, saying flammable materials left behind during maintenance work had allowed the fire “to spread rapidly beyond control.”The buildings had been wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, a traditional but highly flammable material still widely used in Hong Kong.The fire began around 2:50 pm on Wednesday, with the estate under repair and wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, flames spread rapidly through the eight-building complex.The precise cause remains unknown, but officials believe leftover flammable material from maintenance work played a major role in the fire’s fast escalation. Rescue operations and investigations are ongoing.China Taiping underwrote third-party liability and employee compensation for mandatory building and window inspection work at the complex, Bloomberg reported.The HK$316 million (US$41 million) project, which used bamboo scaffolding and protective netting, is now part of an ongoing investigation into the cause of the disaster.The insurer’s policy covers the full contract sum plus an additional HK$50 million (US$6.4 million) for accidents, and provides HK$200 million in employee compensation. Separately, the company holds a general property-all-risk policy worth HK$2 billion.According to Bloomberg, Hong Kong Insurance Professionals Federation chairman Philip Mak said both the general all-risk policy and the construction-specific coverage are “seriously underinsured” given the scale of the multi-tower estate.Mak noted that rebuilding communal areas and replacing elevator steel cables will likely exceed the insured amounts. Individual flat owners may claim death or injury benefits under the HK$50 million accident portion, but he warned the sum is “nowhere near enough” in light of the number of deaths and the hundreds still unaccounted for.",China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project.

The factors influencing turkey prices this Thanksgiving

Grocery stores in the US are absorbing the rising cost of turkeys this Thanksgiving. A spike in bird flu cases has pushed up wholesale prices, according to new data from the US department of agriculture (USDA). But these higher costs are not being passed on to shoppers.USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year. Experts say stores are taking the hit to keep customers coming in, reported NBC News. Even the projected cost of a full Thanksgiving meal has stayed broadly steady.The main reason for the higher costs is a drop in supply. Bird flu has spread again among commercial poultry farms this autumn. By October, more than 2 million turkeys had been culled after exposure. Minnesota, the largest turkey-producing state, reported six confirmed outbreaks that month.David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told NBC, another virus avian metapneumovirus is also affecting production by reducing the number of viable eggs laid by hens. This has slowed farmers’ efforts to rebuild their flocks.Overall, turkey supply is tightening. The USDA expects production to fall to 4.8 million pounds this year, down from 5.1 million pounds in 2024.This shortage has pushed up costs for retailers. USDA data shows the wholesale price of frozen turkeys, the type most families buy for Thanksgiving, has jumped by about 80% since last year, rising from under $1 per pound to more than $1.70.A separate USDA report shows retail prices for frozen turkeys staying flat. Ortega said shops may be absorbing these increases to stop customers from switching stores. Retailers often use turkeys as a “loss leader”, selling them at or below cost to draw in shoppers and make up the difference through other items in their baskets.While turkey prices have stayed stable for shoppers, the overall cost of a Thanksgiving meal varies depending on the data source. Some estimates show prices rising by nearly 10%, while others show a fall of up to 5%.",USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year.

Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta all traded higher. Wellington and Manila lagged.This upswing comes after markets stumbled earlier in the month over fears that the tech-driven surge of recent years had overheated, and returns from heavy AI investments would take time to materialise. For now, those concerns have been overshadowed by the prospect of lower borrowing costs, which are seen as a bigger support for a broader range of companies, including smaller caps.Bitcoin, which had slumped to a seven-month low just above $80,000 during the recent market turmoil, climbed back above $90,000 as risk appetite improved.

AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers

Americans are set for a mix of family meals and early holiday shopping this week, with most big retailers staying shut on Thanksgiving before reopening at dawn for Black Friday, the unofficial start of the Christmas buying rush. The week also marks what AAA says will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record, according to AP report.Most national retailers — including Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Costco — will remain closed on Thursday, returning with early openings from 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Black Friday. CVS will shut early, and Walgreens will close most stores except select 24-hour locations. Grocery chains will open but many will close ahead of schedule, with timings varying by area.Government offices, post offices, courts and schools will be closed. US banks and stock markets will also shut for the day, reopening on Friday for a shortened trading session that ends at 1 p.m. Eastern. Standard FedEx and UPS pickup and delivery services will not operate on Thursday, though limited critical services will be available at certain locations.With schools closed and a long weekend ahead, travel is expected to surge.AAA estimates that 81.8 million people will journey at least 50 miles between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1 — 1.6 million more than last year and a potential new record. Nearly 73 million will travel by car, aided by petrol prices holding near $3 a gallon, slightly below last Thanksgiving’s average.About 6 million Americans are expected to fly domestically, a 2% rise from 2024, though cancellations or delays could shift the final count. Another 2.5 million travellers will rely on buses, trains or cruise ships, marking an 8.5% increase from last year.For many households, Thursday offers a quiet holiday — before the weekend turns into one of the year’s busiest on the roads, at airports and at shop entrances.","AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers.

Zoom in: Burry’s beef isn’t with Nvidia’s books-but its customers’



The big picture: A new bubble with a familiar face



What they're saying: Nvidia responds, Burry doubles down



What’s next



Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in “The Big Short,” is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir-two flagbearers of the AI rally. In a blistering Substack post, Burry dismissed Nvidia’s internal memo rebutting his concerns as “disingenuous on the face, and disappointing. ”He accused the world’s most valuable company of deflecting criticism with “one straw man after another,” charging that Nvidia’s response failed to engage with his actual concerns around depreciation assumptions in the AI ecosystem. The fresh attack comes as investors increasingly debate whether the AI boom has tipped into bubble territory, a Business Insider report said.The criticism comes at a critical moment: Nvidia stock has dropped 14% from its early-November peak, and broader questions are emerging over whether AI’s gold rush has entered speculative territory.Burry’s remarks tap into mounting investor unease-not about innovation, but about how profits are being propped up by accounting choices that may not age well as chip cycles shorten.Burry clarified that he never accused Nvidia of stretching out the depreciation of its own factories or equipment. “No one cares about Nvidia’s own depreciation,” he wrote. “One straw man burnt.”Instead, he zeroed in on cloud giants-Microsoft, Meta, Oracle-who are reportedly extending chip and server depreciation timelines from 3 years to 5 or 6.That, Burry says, lets them spread massive AI hardware costs over longer periods, inflating earnings now while kicking losses down the road.He cited a Microsoft interview in which Satya Nadella said the company slowed data center buildouts to avoid overbuilding for one generation of AI chips-a move Burry sees as confirmation that tech’s depreciation timelines may be out of sync with reality.“The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes,” Burry warned.Burry says today’s AI surge echoes the dot-com bubble-just with faster hardware, loftier assumptions, and bigger accounting risks. He compared Nvidia to Cisco circa 2000, the centerpiece of tech euphoria before the crash.“There is a Cisco at the center of it all,” he wrote. “Its name is Nvidia.”In a particularly stark forecast, Burry predicted tech companies could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, warning that Meta, Oracle and others could overstate earnings by 20–27% if timelines aren't adjusted.Nvidia disputed Burry’s math, especially around its stock buybacks. The company clarified that it has repurchased $91 billion in shares since 2018-not $112.5 billion as Burry implied-and said he mistakenly included RSU-related taxes.Nvidia also defended its GPU longevity, arguing chips like the A100 (released in 2020) are still in full use, justifying longer depreciation periods.Burry remains unmoved. “I stand by my analysis,” he posted on X. “Obviously, the full analysis does not fit in a tweet.”Burry disclosed he still holds put options on both Nvidia and Palantir, despite the market’s growing appetite for all things AI. He claimed they cost about $10 million each-not the $1.1 billion their notional value implied.He’s now using his new paywalled newsletter, “Cassandra Unchained,” to argue that this AI cycle isn’t just about tech-it’s also about the accounting scaffolding propping it up.“I have been drawn into something much bigger than me,” he wrote.If he’s right again, this won’t be the last straw man he sets alight.(With inputs from agencies)","Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in ‘The Big Short,’ is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir.

It is the result of decades of investment across every stage of the chain — from mining and reserves to processing and technology — giving Beijing significant influence in its trade dispute with Washington.These 17 minerals are essential for defence equipment such as fighter jets, radar systems and missile guidance, and are also used in smartphones, medical tools and cars.According to news agency AFP reporters who visited Ganzhou this month, found the heavy rare earths region buzzing with activity despite tight surveillance.The area produces elements like yttrium and terbium, and the agency reporters witnessed trucks moving in and out of mines and busy processing plants.The city is also constructing new headquarters for China Rare Earth Group, one of two major state-owned players formed after years of government-led consolidation.Economics lecturer Heron Lim told AFP that recent disruptions have encouraged more countries to consider expanding their own production, adding that such moves “could pay longer-term dividends.”Trade tensions push rare earths to centre stageChina’s export restrictions announced in early October shook global manufacturers and alarmed Washington, which is locked in a renewed trade war with Beijing under President Donald Trump’s second term.After talks in South Korea, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce that temporarily secures supplies of rare earths and other minerals — a development widely viewed as favourable to Beijing.Lim said rare earths would likely remain central to future negotiations, noting that China has shown it is prepared to use trade tools to keep the US engaged. He added that the uncertainty has created difficulties for industries dependent on these metals.During the Cold War, the United States led the rare earths industry, with the Mountain Pass mine in California supplying much of the world.But as relations with Moscow improved and environmental concerns grew, the US shifted production overseas through the 1980s and 1990s.China now accounts for about two-thirds of global mining and roughly 90% of processing, according to analysis cited by AFP. It also holds the world’s largest reserves and leads in patents, supported by strict export controls on processing technology.Commodities analyst Amelia Haines was quoted by AFP as saying that the heavy reliance on imports poses “significant risks to critical industries,” which could accelerate a broader push for mineral security.The US has been attempting for years to rebuild its rare earths capacity. Defence agencies have invested heavily to establish a full “mine-to-magnet” chain by 2027.Washington has also signed critical minerals agreements with allies including Australia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand.Trump recently announced an $8.5 billion rare earths partnership with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.This urgency is not new. In 2010, China briefly halted rare earth shipments to Japan during a territorial dispute, highlighting the geopolitical stakes.The Obama administration called for strengthening US resilience, yet 15 years on, China remains the dominant force in the sector.",China's control over rare earth elements did not happen overnight.

Budget leak shock: UK's Treasury chief Reeves unveils tax plan in Parliament; Labour braces for political fallout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/budget-leak-shock-uks-treasury-chief-reeves-unveils-tax-plan-in-parliament-labour-braces-for-political-fallout/articleshow/125590941.cms,"Britain’s Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered her tax-raising budget on Wednesday under the shadow of a major leak that exposed her proposals hours before she reached Parliament. The disclosure came from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which Reeves relies on for independent forecasts. According to AP, the leak effectively mapped out the entire fiscal package.The OBR said a “technical error” caused the documents to go live early on its website and apologised for the breach, adding that it would report the lapse to all relevant authorities, including the Treasury. AP reported that the biggest revenue measure is a freeze on tax thresholds that will push more earners into higher bands as wages rise.Other announcements flagged in the leaked papers include a mansion tax on high-value properties, changes to the capital tax regime and a reduction in tax-free allowances for private pensions. The documents estimate that the government will raise 26 billion pounds ($34 billion) in 2029–30.The episode has embarrassed the Labour government, which has already been grappling with weeks of speculation and mixed signals that unsettled financial markets.This is Reeves’ second budget since Labour’s landslide return to power in July 2024.Reeves repeated that her overall message remains unchanged from her first budget, when she said there would be only one major tax-raising exercise this parliamentary term, which runs to 2029. But the UK economy has struggled to match her expectations, with critics pointing to last year’s business tax increases as a drag.Although Britain briefly led the G7 in growth during the first half of the year, momentum faded again. “The chancellor faces a delicate balancing act of conveying fiscal stability while advancing the growth agenda,” said Peter Arnold, chief economist at EY UKBritain’s long struggle to recover from the 2008–09 financial crisis continues to weigh on tax revenues. Those pressures have been compounded by the economic costs of the pandemic, the Russia–Ukraine war and US President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, with Brexit adding additional strain since 2020.Reeves also faces a raft of spending promises aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains elevated. Measures include reversing planned welfare cuts, reviewing the cap on benefits for larger families and offering relief through frozen rail fares or lower green taxes on energy bills.The political stakes are high for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is battling concern within Labour over his poor poll numbers. Surveys consistently place Labour behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. With an election not required until 2029, the government is banking on stronger growth to improve its standing, but analysts warn that a misjudged budget could deepen the sense of crisis around Starmer’s leadership.","Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered her tax-raising budget on Wednesday under the shadow of a major leak.

Inflation? Why Thanksgiving is cheaper this year (and what that says about the economy),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/inflation-why-thanksgiving-is-cheaper-this-year-and-what-that-says-about-the-economy/articleshow/125590223.cms,"The turkey got cheaper, not the world



Retailers are buying your gratitude



The feast is cheaper, the sides are sulking



Farmers were not invited to this celebration



Politics of the poultry index



The Costco shortcut and the new definition of convenience



what dishes count as “standard”,

how many portions they define as “normal”,

what ingredients get included or excluded,

Cheap thanks, expensive future



Retailers are deliberately discounting turkey as a loss leader to attract shoppers.

Wholesale costs have not collapsed, meaning the discount is a financed illusion.

Some key food categories — especially grains — have cooled, reducing the cost of specific items.

Other categories — vegetables, fruits, beverages — remain expensive.

Consumers have traded down to store brands, frozen pies and smaller menus.

Farmers are facing higher costs and lower margins.

Inflation is slowing, not reversing.

Politicians are selling a narrative more than a macroeconomic reality.

For a country that once launched a revolution over the price of tea, America gets remarkably sentimental about the cost of turkey. Every November, economists, politicians and supermarket executives gather around a metaphorical table to debate the national poultry index, as if the fate of the republic depends on whether a 16-pound bird costs twenty dollars or twenty-five.This year, for the first time in a while, that conversation contains a four-letter word that Americans haven’t heard in a long time: down. The Thanksgiving dinner is officially cheaper. But the story of why it is cheaper is far more interesting than the number itself. It’s a tale of retail psychology, farmer misery, supply chain politics, and the great American tradition of pretending a discount is the same thing as prosperity.Let’s begin with the headline. The average cost of the classic Thanksgiving dinner for ten has dipped a few percentage points. The centrepiece of this softened inflation narrative is the turkey. A standard bird is significantly cheaper this year — the sharpest drop in years — and it has lowered the overall cost of the meal.But here’s the real twist: the world around that turkey is still expensive. Food-at-home prices remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.Everyday staples like cereals, fresh vegetables, condiments and beverages are still inching upward. Grocery bills are not collapsing. They are simply not rising as brutally as they did in 2022 and 2023.Think of Thanksgiving as the supermarket’s Bollywood song-and-dance sequence. Eighty per cent of the movie is gritty realism. But for five minutes, everyone forgets their troubles and celebrates because the turkey looks cheap.Why is the turkey cheap if the world is not? Simple. Retailers are taking the hit.In the supermarket playbook, the Thanksgiving turkey is the emotional equivalent of “free delivery”. It’s a loss leader — the product a store sells at or below cost to drag you inside and make sure you buy everything else at full price.Grocery giants know that Americans treat Thanksgiving like a ritual. You must buy the turkey. You must buy the sides. You must buy the extras. The only question is where. And that is where the retail war begins.Several major chains are deliberately discounting turkeys even though their own acquisition costs have gone up. Wholesale prices have risen due to disease outbreaks in turkey flocks and feed costs that haven’t come down nearly enough. But supermarkets are absorbing that pain because the turkey discount is an unbeatable form of customer acquisition.Tech companies give free trials. Supermarkets sacrifice poultry margins.And as every business student learns on day one: customer eyeballs today are worth more than profit margins this week.This “cheaper Thanksgiving” narrative also depends heavily on what you choose to count.Turkey and wheat-based products — bread, buns, pie crusts — have become cheaper thanks to slightly better global crop cycles and softer consumer demand. Frozen items, store brands and bulk packs have also become more popular, forcing retailers to compete on price.But vegetables? Those are having an existential crisis. Weather disruptions in key growing regions have hit sweet potatoes and green beans. Basic vegetable trays have shot up in price in many parts of the country. Fresh fruit is pricier thanks to transportation and import pressures. Canned goods, especially those dependent on metal and packaging costs, are not giving any Thanksgiving discounts.So yes, the meal looks cheaper. But it is the turkey that is doing the heavy lifting while half the sides are quietly sulking in the corner, waiting for someone to notice their suffering.If there is one group that does not feel thankful this year, it is the American farming community.Consumers see the downturn in the cost of the Thanksgiving basket. Farmers see a very different ledger. Crop prices for some staples have declined, but their input costs haven’t. Fertiliser, fuel, machinery and labour remain stubbornly high. Weather shocks — drought, heat waves, erratic rains — continue to disrupt yields unpredictably.Turkey farmers, in particular, have been hammered. Outbreaks of avian flu have led to culling entire flocks after a single infection. One diseased bird means a financial disaster for a farmer who spent months raising hundreds. Retailers can afford to discount a turkey. Farmers cannot afford to lose one.The Thanksgiving discount that consumers are celebrating is made possible partly because someone else is swallowing pain higher up the supply chain.This is not a moral argument. It is a business one. Retailers compress margins aggressively. Farmers have no margins left to compress. Inflation did not leave. It simply dressed up as generosity. This is the part where inflation performs one of its favourite magic tricks: anchoring.After years of high inflation, consumers have adjusted their expectations upwards. So when a $64 Thanksgiving meal becomes a $55 meal, it feels like a relief — even if the same dinner cost far less just a few years ago. This is not victory. It is relief masquerading as recovery.And retailers exploit this psychology brilliantly. A sharply discounted, culturally significant product creates a narrative of “things are finally getting better”. Meanwhile, dozens of other items around the store have quietly gone up by 2 to 10 percent. You notice the cheap turkey. You do not notice the expensive soda, the quietly inflated butter, or the premium packaging costs.In business terms, the turkey is the shiny notification. Everything else is the terms and conditions.Any national holiday with food and numbers will inevitably be hijacked by politics. Thanksgiving is no exception.Cheap turkey prices become evidence of economic competency. Expensive turkey prices become evidence of national collapse. Every White House, regardless of party, loves claiming credit for a “cheaper Thanksgiving”, even when the primary drivers are retail strategy, not government policy.This year, politicians have repeated the line that the Thanksgiving meal is significantly cheaper. They highlight the change from last year. They do not highlight the change from 2018 or 2015, because that comparison is far less flattering.The turkey aisle becomes a political prop. The optics serve everyone. Retailers get attention. Politicians get talking points. Consumers get the illusion of victory.Everyone wins the narrative. No one wins the economics.There’s another emerging trend: the pre-assembled Thanksgiving meal. Big box retailers now offer complete kits that feed families for less than the average DIY cost.On the surface, this looks like efficiency and savings. Underneath, it is something else entirely.When you outsource your Thanksgiving meal to a corporation, the company gains power over:Software companies call this bundling. Economists call it controlling the supply chain. Grandma calls it “not my Thanksgiving”.Think of it as the Netflix-ification of holiday meals. A corporation decides the menu. You just show up and hit play.So why exactly is Thanksgiving cheaper this year?Let’s strip away the marketing and look at the mechanics:This year’s Thanksgiving is not proof that the economy is healed. It is proof that retailers are very good at narrative management. The Thanksgiving basket is a PR campaign wrapped in aluminium foil.It is also a case study in how the American consumer economy works. When inflation rages, retailers raise prices. When inflation softens, retailers lower selective prices and call it generosity. When the economy is jittery, the turkey becomes a bargaining chip in a much larger psychological war for customer loyalty.And here is the final irony.Americans will sit around their tables this November and give thanks for a slightly cheaper meal. But the price cut is not the result of a benevolent market, a miraculous supply chain recovery or a sudden burst of federal competence.It is the result of carefully calibrated retail economics. Someone decided that your gratitude was worth a discounted bird. Someone else — usually a farmer — paid for that gratitude out of their own margins. And the rest of the store quietly made back what the turkey lost.The turkey may be cheaper. The world around it is not. But in a year where everything feels a bit fragile, America will take the small win. Even if it is cooked, seasoned and packaged to perfection by the marketing department.",The average cost of the classic Thanksgiving dinner for ten has dipped a few percentage points. A standard bird is significantly cheaper this year — the sharpest drop in years. But here’s the real twist: the world around that turkey is still expensive.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125590328,imgsize-56612,width-400,resizemode-4/why-your-turkey-is-cheaper-this-year.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"ITR filing deadline: Don’t miss December 31, 2024 deadline for revised, belated tax returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-deadline-dont-miss-december-31-2024-deadline-for-revised-belated-tax-returns-here-are-the-consequences/articleshow/116495382.cms,"If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.

ITR filing: What are the consequences of missing the belated return filing deadline on December 31, 2024?



ITR filing: What if you miss the revised return filing December 31, 2024 deadline?

ITR filing deadline : December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Whilst various taxpayer categories have distinct ITR filing deadlines, the final date for belated and revised returns remains the same. Many individuals remain unaware of the implications of missing the December 31, 2024, submission deadline for FY 2023-24.If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.Under Section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, belated returns incur a Rs 5,000 penalty, regardless of outstanding tax amounts. A reduced penalty of Rs 1,000 applies for lower taxable income. However, individuals with income below the Rs 3 lakh basic exemption limit face no penalties.Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary of Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, told ET, ""Belated return is the last chance for the taxpayer to file the ITR and claim refunds and certain losses. If the belated return is not filed, the person misses those claims and credits for that assessment year. After the expiry of the filing of the belated return, only an updated return can be filed subject to the condition that there is a tax liability payable. Further, if no belated return is filed, the taxpayer shall have to face increased interests and penalties on the tax liabilities if a notice is sent by the income tax department.""A significant limitation of filing belated returns for FY 2023-24 is the inability to select the old tax regime , as the new regime became default from April 1, 2023. Consequently, belated returns must follow the new tax regime .Also Read | Avoid Rs 10 lakh income tax penalty! Why it's important to report foreign income, assets in ITR by December 31, 2024 - check details The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime. These provisions helped reduce taxable income and subsequent tax obligations.The new regime permits only two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) and employer NPS contributions up to 10% of basic salary. Additional benefits like Section 80C, 80D, and HRA exemptions are not applicable under the new structure.When a taxpayer needs to rectify errors in original or belated returns, they must submit a revised return. This allows corrections of various oversights, such as unreported income, unclaimed deductions, or omitted bank account details.Bhuta says, ""If the taxpayer misses the deadline to file a revised return, there is no other mechanism to file a revised return again for that assessment year and to claim refunds or losses. The income tax laws allow the filing of an updated return. However, the updated return cannot be filed in cases where the taxpayer has losses, it results in an increased refund, or the tax return has an effect of reducing the total tax liability as filed in the original or belated return. There are many other criteria as to when an updated return cannot be filed. So, if a taxpayer misses the revised return deadline, the only way in which any additional claim or credit can be requested is during the assessment proceedings. However, that is subject to litigation.""Also Read | PAN 2.0: How to easily apply for PAN Card reprint with QR code - check 6 simple steps online Whilst taxpayers can submit multiple revised returns, tax experts advise against frequent revisions as this could trigger scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.Regarding intimation notices, Bhuta explains, ""As per section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ITR can be revised only before three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of assessment, whichever event happens first. The ITR can be revised even after an intimation has been received under section 143(1). However, once the ITR is processed under a regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3), the same cannot be revised.""For the financial year 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), taxpayers have until December 31, 2024, to submit their revised returns.","December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2016, specific consequences apply.

Sunita William’s return mission to Earth delayed once again till March 2025

Astronauts are the ultimate adventurers, exchanging Earth’s gravity for the weightlessness of space! These daring explorers suit up in advanced spacesuits, board rockets traveling at 17,500 mph, and embark on missions to unravel the mysteries of the universe. But being an astronaut is far more than floating in zero gravity or capturing breathtaking Earth photos—it’s a high-risk role where every decision counts. From avoiding space debris to surviving in the harshest environment known to humanity, they undergo rigorous training and endure extreme conditions.Take Sunita Williams , for instance, who spent an astonishing 322 days in space. Her job demanded courage, resilience, and the ability to tackle immense challenges. What kind of salary would NASA offer for braving the isolation, hazards, and immense responsibilities of life in space? From dodging cosmic dangers to performing critical experiments, this isn’t your average paycheck. Dive in to discover the intriguing details behind their out-of-this-world earnings.Sunita (Suni) L. Williams, a trailblazer in space exploration, has been reaching for the stars since being selected as a NASA astronaut in 1998. A veteran of two missions, Expeditions 14/15 and 32/33, she has spent countless hours living and working among the stars. Most recently, on June 5, 2024, Sunita Williams and astronaut Butch Wilmore launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft for its highly anticipated first crewed flight, arriving at the International Space Station (ISS) a day later. When Starliner’s mission was shifted to uncrewed operations, Suni and Wilmore seamlessly transitioned to life aboard the ISS as key members of Expedition 71/72. Their cosmic journey will conclude in February 2025 when they return to Earth aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, joined by NASA’s Nick Hague and Roscosmos’ Aleksandr Gorbunov, on NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission. Suni’s journey is a testament to human adaptability and the spirit of exploration.NASA, the world’s largest space agency, is a top destination for aspiring astronauts. As per reports, civilian astronaut salaries at NASA are determined by U.S. government pay scales, specifically grades GS-13 to GS-15.These pay scales reflect the level of responsibility and expertise required for NASA’s challenging missions, ensuring astronauts are well-compensated for their extraordinary work.Sunita Williams, a retired US Navy Captain and Indian-origin astronaut, has received many benefits from NASA, including:NASA astronauts are paid based on their experience and qualifications, and are assigned to grades GS-13 to GS-15 on the General Schedule (GS) pay scale. In 2024, the salary range for NASA astronauts is between USD 84,365 to USD 115,079 annually.NASA provides comprehensive health insurance to support astronauts' physical demands.NASA offers advanced training for astronauts.NASA provides psychological support for astronauts and their families before, during, and after each space mission.Astronauts have access to communication with family and friends, and receive care packages.NASA astronauts receive symbolic travel allowances.Astronauts' salaries are influenced by their mission responsibilities, leadership roles, and rank.NASA protects astronauts in case of occupational health issues or mission-related incidents.The return of Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams from the International Space Station (ISS) has been delayed once more, with her mission now extended into 2025. Originally planned for 7 to 10 days, Williams’ stay has been prolonged due to safety concerns surrounding the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. NASA now expects her return to Earth aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon in late March or April 2025. Despite speculation about her health, Williams, a seasoned astronaut, continues to follow a strict training schedule in space. This extended mission has allowed her and her team to contribute to ongoing research and maintenance on the ISS, with plans for a crew handover and upcoming spacewalks.Also Read: NASA delays Sunita Williams’ return to Earth until March 2025; here’s why","Astronauts are paid based on their experience and qualifications, and are assigned to grades GS-13 to GS-15 on the General Schedule (GS) pay scale.

Google proposes fix to solve search monopoly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/google-proposes-fix-to-solve-search-monopoly/articleshow/116551583.cms,"WASHINGTON: Google said Friday what it thought should change to address a ruling that it had illegally maintained a monopoly over online search: not much.It follows the landmark ruling in Aug by judge Amit P Mehta of the US district court for the district of Columbia, who said Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple and Samsung to be the search engine that automatically appears when users open a web browser or a smartphone. The govt then asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular browser, among other remedies.In Google's own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement. But it said those agreements should be less restrictive than in the past.Apple, for example, could select different search engines to come up automatically for iPhone and iPad users, said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's VP of regulatory affairs, in a blog post. Cellphone makers using Google's popular operating system, Android, could also install multiple search engines and could install other Google apps without installing its search tool or its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant product.""We don't propose these changes lightly,"" she said.

Britannica didn't just survive. It's an AI company now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/britannica-didnt-just-survive-its-an-ai-company-now/articleshow/116551465.cms,"For nearly 250 years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a bookshelf-busting series of gilt-lettered tomes, often purchased to show that its owners cared about knowledge. It was the sort of physical media expected to die in the internet era, and indeed, the encyclopedia's publisher announced that it was ending the print edition in 2012. Skeptics wondered how Britannica the company could survive in the age of Wikipedia. The answer was to adapt to the times.Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries. It also sells artificial intelligence agent software that underpins apps like customer service chatbots and data retrieval.Britannica has figured out not only how to survive, but also how to do well financially. Jorge Cauz, its CEO, said in an interview that the publisher enjoyed pro forma profit margins of about 45%.The company is weighing an initial public offering, in which it could seek a valuation of about $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations.That could provide a sizable return for the company's owner, Swiss financier Jacob E Safra, who acquired the publisher in 1995 and, in a lawsuit filed in 2022, cited an investment bank in valuing Britannica at $500 million. The company says its websites draw over 7 billion annual page views a year, with users in more than 150 countries.Britannica has come far from its origins in the 18th century as the publisher of a reference work put together by three Scottish printers. Over the years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica became a heavyweight of the knowledge business, both literally - the 32-volume 2010 edition, the last to run in print, weighed 129 pounds - and figuratively, drawing on contributions from thousands of experts. It also became an aspirational status symbol, with customers paying nearly $1,400 for that edition.By the time the last Encyclopaedia Britannica was printed, the company had already started its suite of websites and educational software. Now it sees even greater opportunity in the growth of generative AI tools , which the company says can help make learning more dynamic - and therefore more desirable.Cauz said Britannica had experimented with the technology over the past few decades. It acquired Melingo, the company that makes its AI agent software, in 2000 because of its strength in natural language processing and machine learning. And it has two technology teams, based in Chicago and in Tel Aviv.The vertiginous popularity of chatbots like ChatGPT convinced executives that they needed to invest more in the space. Britannica now uses AI in creating, fact-checking and translating content for its products, including the online encyclopedia. It also created a Britannica chatbot that draws on its online encyclopedia's stores of information, which Cauz said was more likely to be accurate than the more generalised chatbots that could be prone to ""hallucinations.""The firm has more projects powered by generative AI in the pipeline: an English-language tutoring software that will use the tech to power avatars and customise lessons for each student, a program to help teachers create lesson plans, and a revamped thesaurus for the Merriam-Webster website that can handle phrases, not just words.","Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam- Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries.

Having established support above $0.000025, the Pepe price could flip the ATH of $0.000028 and set a new record in the coming days.According to Rose Premium Signal, a crypto analyst on X, Pepe's price will hit $0.00004251 in the short term. The analyst believes $0.000020 is a good entry point in case of a dip. In a tweet, another analyst, Chandler Bing, thinks the altcoin price is about to break out with a potential target of $0.000031.Lunex Network (LNEX) is rising to become a major force in the DeFi space. As a next-gen web3 DeFi crypto exchange, Lunex Network is built to solve issues of interoperability, scalability, and high gas fees in exchanges. As a non-custodial exchange, the new trading exchange will allow for easy buying, selling and swapping of digital assets without the need for KYC.Designed with advanced trading tools, Lunex Network will allow traders access to over 50,000 trading pairs at the cheapest fees. Its unique portfolio tracker will allow traders to track multiple assets like cryptos, stocks, etc. The DeFi wallet enables traders to seamlessly buy, sell, and swap cryptos from one account.Unlike other exchanges, Lunex Network has several avenues to reward the community. There is a revenue-sharing model aimed at rewarding the LNEX token holders. Also, token holders can access discounts on transaction fees or stake their tokens for maximum APY. As a deflationary token, all listing fees will be paid in LNEX, putting buying pressure.Experts who have reviewed the project think that LNEX will follow the path of BNB, which surged by over 1,000% within a few months of listing. As such, at just $0.0046, investors have the opportunity to accumulate the token. Given the over $5.3 million raised in the cryptocurrency ICO funding and the 283% ROI for early investors, LNEX might hit $1 on listing in a major exchange.This year's crypto rally has been explosive, with altcoins setting new records. With the Dogecoin price showing signs of a resurgence, the top meme coin could set a new ATH soon. The rising interest in Pepe among whales makes it one of the altcoins to watch out for in this bull cycle. Given the huge ROI of LNEX within a short time, the new DeFi coin could hit $1 by the time the trading exchange launches fully.You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:Website: Lunex Network Telegram: Join Our Telegram Community Twitter: Follow Us On X","Just like Pepe Coin, Dogecoin's price has witnessed a slight correction in the past few days. Popular market watchers have projected massive rallies, which could push the DOGE price to a new ATH. Pepe is another top meme coin witnessing massive whale accumulation, a move that could double the Pepe coin price soon.

"Wall Street: US stocks fall sharply, Dow tumbles 1,100 points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-us-stocks-fall-sharply-dow-tumbles-1100-points/articleshow/116454520.cms,"Lingering inflationary pressures and the transition to the Trump administration have introduced additional variables into the Fed’s calculus.

Bond yields climb, stock market feels the squeeze

Winners and losers on Wall Street

Global markets and economic uncertainty

Economic outlook clouds amid inflation and political shifts

US stock markets endured one of their most severe declines of the year on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled a shift in its monetary policy trajectory. The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,123 points, or 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite suffered the worst drop, declining 3.6%.The central bank announced its third rate cut of the year, lowering its main interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, it was the Fed’s updated projections for 2025 that rattled investors: Policymakers now anticipate only two additional cuts next year, down from four projected just three months ago.“We are in a new phase of the process,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, explaining the tempered outlook as a response to robust job market performance, rising inflation readings, and economic uncertainties, including the upcoming Trump administration’s policies.Treasury yields surged following the Fed's announcement, exerting additional pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40%, while the two-year yield, more sensitive to Fed actions, increased to 4.35% from 4.25%.Higher yields typically hurt stock valuations, particularly for companies reliant on borrowing to drive growth. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 4.4%, reflecting the acute impact of rising interest rates on smaller-cap stocks.“We’re seeing the market recalibrate for a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. “The Fed’s announcement caught investors off guard, eroding confidence in the expected pace of rate reductions.”Among individual stocks, General Mills fell 3.1% despite better-than-expected quarterly profits, as its lowered profit forecast for the year spooked investors. Nvidia, a significant driver of this year’s market rally, dropped 1.1%, extending its losses to over 13% since its record high last month.Conversely, Jabil surged 7.3% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raising its full-year revenue forecast.Global markets displayed mixed reactions. In London, the FTSE 100 rose marginally by less than 0.1%, buoyed by data showing UK inflation at an eight-month high. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged when it announces its decision on Thursday.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%, even as Nissan shares jumped 23.7% on reports of potential collaboration with Honda. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors, partly owned by Nissan, saw its shares soar nearly 20%.Powell noted that while rate cuts could stimulate economic growth, they also risk exacerbating inflation. “When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,” he said, likening the Fed’s approach to navigating a foggy night.Lingering inflationary pressures and the transition to the Trump administration have introduced additional variables into the Fed’s calculus. Powell acknowledged that some officials are already weighing the implications of potential fiscal policy changes, including tariffs and spending initiatives.Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack was the lone dissenter in Wednesday’s decision, arguing against the rate cut.As Wall Street digests the Fed’s outlook, concerns grow that the anticipated “Santa Claus rally” may be replaced by further volatility, with analysts suggesting that traders may lock in profits amid uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024.

US Federal Reserve cuts interest rate by 25 basis points in key FOMC meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rate-by-25-basis-points-in-key-fomc-meet/articleshow/116445969.cms,"Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy.

The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, according to an official statement following the key FOMC meeting. This 25 basis points cut has led to the central banks benchmark policy rate being in the 4.25% to 4.50% range. This represents a decrease of one full percentage point from its September level, when the Fed initiated the relaxation of stringent monetary measures implemented to address the inflation spike that commenced in 2021.The US central bank modified a crucial component of its interest rate management system on Wednesday by reducing the reverse repo facility rate more significantly than the federal funds rate reduction. The reverse repo rate has been decreased by 30 basis points to 4.25% from its previous 4.55%.Market specialists suggest this anticipated adjustment represents the Federal Reserve's effort to encourage the movement of funds away from a facility that is commonly regarded as an indicator of surplus liquidity within the financial framework.The overnight reverse repo facility (ONRPP) rate, which the Federal Reserve offers, enables money market funds and other entities to deposit funds with the central bank through what essentially amounts to a secured loan. This ONRPP rate functions to establish a flexible lower boundary for all short-term interest rates.""In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC statement read.""In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments,"" the statement added.Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy marked by strong growth, minimal unemployment, and gradually declining, yet persistently elevated inflation levels.KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk in her pre-meeting analysis said, ""Debate will be heated,"" she said. ""The economy remains stronger than participants at the meeting thought it would be when they started cutting in September, while improvements in inflation appear to have stalled ... The Fed is going to want time to pause to see where we are and how policy may shift after the president-elect is sworn in.""Following Trump's inauguration on January 20, the Fed's subsequent meeting occurs on January 28-29. A Reuters survey indicates that 58 out of 99 economists anticipate the central bank will maintain current rates during this meeting, allowing time to evaluate economic developments.","The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

"Amazon’s cloud unit bets on new models, chips to catch up in AI race",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazons-cloud-unit-bets-on-new-models-chips-to-catch-up-in-ai-race/articleshow/116444528.cms,"(The writer was in Las Vegas at invitation of AWS)

LAS VEGAS: Amazon’s cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT forced tech giants to redraw plans, wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. “When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,” Jassy said at AWS’s annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.“With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it’s chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,” Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS’s answer to AI foundation models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS’s announcements at the cloud conference. The company unveiled AI semiconductor Trainium2 which is expected to chip away at Nvidia ’s stranglehold by reducing customer costs. AWS unveiled Apple as one of its newest chip customers. It also announced an ‘ultracluster’ — which aims to provide supercomputer-like computing power to let customers train their AI models using multiple chips. It will also enable Anthropic, an AI startup into which Amazon has poured $8 billion, to train its Claude models and take on Microsoft-backed OpenAI.According to analysts, rapid tech development means that no company has a moat, and breakthroughs are quickly adopted by other companies. In such a scenario, the key challenge will be to retain customers who may find it increasingly easy to switch vendors amid antitrust scrutiny.“Customers are driven by cost, accuracy & latency (data transfer delay)... (AI) models are becoming more of a commodity. It’s not like two years ago, where you’ll be chasing the new shiny star,” AWS’s Marcus said.AWS is also betting on AI startups in the early stages by offering millions of dollars worth of credits for its cloud services.AWS head of startups (Asia-Pacific & Japan) Tiffany Bloomquist told TOI: “In India, in addition to Mumbai and Bangalore, I went to Coimbatore... Even in tier-2 cities, developers are seeing AI as a critical new enabler to disrupt traditional technologies they operate in.”Analysts say that even as Microsoft has gained AI market share, AWS has brought potential solutions with its new launches.“AWS has the edge with machine learning workloads and customers, which should be easy to move to GenAI,” Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said. “The AI race is a marathon, not a sprint.”",AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications.

Nissan and Honda consider merger to take on world's biggest carmaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nissan-and-honda-consider-merger-to-take-on-worlds-biggest-carmaker/articleshow/116417671.cms,"Honda, Nissan (Agencies)

Taking on Toyota



Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are exploring a potential merger, according to people familiar with the matter, which would create a singular rival to Toyota Motor Corp. in Japan and better position the combined company to face competitive challenges around the world.Honda is considering several options including a merger, capital tie-up or the establishment of a holding company, Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama said on Wednesday, following reports overnight of talks between the carmakers. Nissan shares rose as much as 24% in early trading on Wednesday, while Honda’s stock fell as much as 3.4%.The two have been holding preliminary talks about a combination, said the people, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. One option being considered is the creation of a new holding company under which the combined businesses would operate, one of the people said. The transaction could also be expanded to include Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which already has capital ties with Nissan, the person said.Discussions are early stage and may not lead to an agreement, the people said.A deal would effectively consolidate the Japanese auto industry into two main camps: One controlled by Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi and another consisting of Toyota group companies. It would also provide them with more resources to compete with larger peers globally after downsizing long-held partnerships with other carmakers. Nissan has loosened ties with France’s Renault SA and Honda has backed away from General Motors Co.The move toward a merger would follow a decision by the two companies earlier this year to work together on electric vehicle batteries and software. At that time, Honda Chief Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe floated the possibility of a capital tie-up with Nissan.“If the merger does materialize, it would provide short-term relief for Nissan’s financial struggles,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida.The two Japanese carmakers plan to sign a memorandum of understanding to discuss shared equity stakes in a new holding company, the Nikkei reported earlier in the day. The merger would help the manufacturers compete against rivals in electric vehicles such as Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers, it said.American depositary receipts of Honda and Nissan shares climbed on the report. Nissan ADRs rose 12% and Honda’s gained 0.9% in late New York trading.In some ways, it could be seen as a defensive merger among Japan’s weaker players. Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi combined sold about 4 million vehicles globally in the first six months of the year, well shy of the 5.2 million that Toyota sold on its own. Combining forces would allow the two companies to fend off Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, at home and abroad. Toyota has taken stakes in Subaru Corp., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., creating a powerhouse of brands backed by its top-notch credit rating.“While this would be good news for Nissan due to their weakened state, they would have a lot of overlap and other issues to overcome,” said Julie Boote, a senior analyst at Pelham Smithers Associates. “For the Toyota group though we could see an acceleration there as well as it gathers its flock more tightly under its wing in a show of commitment, with the possibility of raising its stakes in Subaru, Suzuki and Mazda sooner rather than later.”Honda’s valuation stood at ¥6.8 trillion ($44.4 billion) as of the close of trading in Tokyo on Tuesday, well above Nissan’s ¥1.3 trillion market capitalization. But even their combined value is dwarfed by Toyota’s ¥42.2 trillion.Honda has long struggled to keep up with bigger capitalized rivals when it comes to investments in new technologies. It recently has shifted gears to boost hybrid gas-electric vehicles even as it spends billions of dollars on all-electric production. At the same time, Honda’s arms-length partnership with GM has been weakened, most recently earlier this month when their self-driving car partnership ended. GM has strengthened its ties with South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co.Nissan is in need of a partner to put it back on a stronger financial footing as it steps up restructuring efforts to cope with stalled revenue growth and lower profits. It faces pressure from an activist shareholder and a daunting debt load that has led to speculation in credit markets about its investment grade rating.The Yokohama-based company has partially unwound its complex 25-year strategic partnership with Renault, a fixation of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn. Rivalries and mutual suspicion mounted over the years and came to a head when Ghosn openly contemplated a merger, contributing to his downfall.The former chairman and CEO, who has filed a suit against his former company for ousting him in 2018, warned of a “disguised takeover” of Nissan by Honda in an August interview with Automotive News.The merger talks come after the Financial Times said last month that Nissan was looking for an anchor investor to replace part of Renault’s equity holding and that it hadn’t ruled out having Honda buy some of its shares.","Honda is considering several options including a merger, capital tie-up or the establishment of a holding company. Nissan shares rose as much as 24% in early trading on Wednesday, while Honda’s stock fell 3.4%. A deal would effectively consolidate the Japanese auto industry into two main camps.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116417831,imgsize-546344,width-400,resizemode-4/116417831.jpg"

Your views on the IER?

Who can apply for International Entrepreneur Parole?

Have major ownership (at least 10% initially) in a US startup created within the last 5 years.

Play a central and active role in the startup.

Can show that the startup will have a positive public benefit on the U.S. by having:



Received a significant investment from qualified U.S. investors (typically venture capitalists, angel investors, or startup accelerators).



Received significant awards or grants from federal, state, or local government entities.



Partially meeting one or both of the above with added evidence showing potential for rapid growth or job creation.

What are the new threshold amounts for investment/grants?

The qualified investment amount has increased from $264,147 to $311,071.

The awards or grants amount has increased from $105,659 to $124,429.

What are the new criteria for qualified investors?

Why did the amounts change?

For want of a better term, the International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) is often referred to as the ‘start-up’ visa. IER enables ‘qualified’ international entrepreneurs (based on prescribed criteria including funds raised, to obtain immigration ‘parole’ – that is to temporarily enter and stay in the US and nurture their startup, despite not having a work visa or a green card. Commonly, IER is known as the startup visa, but it is actually a permit for eligible foreign entrepreneurs to stay in the US for two and a half years with the possibility of another extension of a similar tenure.Recently, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated the threshold amounts for the IER program and updated the supporting evidence required. Starting October 1, 2024, there are new changes to the investment and revenue requirements.The program has had a contentious history. Originally created at the end of the Obama Administration, IER was targeted for removal by the Trump Administration before it was launched. Due to a successful lawsuit filed by the National Venture Capital Association, it remained in force but was not seen as a viable option as the Trump administration repeatedly tried to end the program.Finally in May 2021, under the Biden administration the US department of homeland security (DHS) announced that it is withdrawing a ‘proposed’ rule introduced by the Trump administration that would have rescinded the IER program. Given this past, till date only 94 IEP applications have been filed, with just 26 approvals. The approval can take anything between a few months to a few years.What happens next? It remains to be seen. Meanwhile, TOI spoke with, immigration attorney, to understand the IER program and the changes.IER is a fantastic initiative that allows certain foreign entrepreneurs to live and work in the US temporarily. While it’s not technically a visa, it provides a pathway for founders to enter the US, build their businesses, create jobs, and boost the economy.Innovation and entrepreneurship are the backbone of the American economy. They fuel job creation, spark new industries, and keep the US at the cutting edge of technological advancement. Immigrant entrepreneurs are a vital part of this, bringing fresh ideas and a relentless drive to succeed.Immigrant entrepreneurs may be eligible for the IEP if they:Remember that it is still possible to apply if you have received less than the above, but we would want to bolster the case with additional evidence of the startup’s potential for growth and job creation.A US investor is considered ‘qualified’ if they have made investments of at least $746,571 (previously $633,952) in other startups. Additionally, at least 2 of those startups must have created at least 5 qualified jobs or generated $622,142 (previously $528,293) in revenue with average annual revenue growth of at least 20%.By regulation, the investment and revenue amounts must be automatically adjusted every 3 years by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).","The International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) is often referred to as the ‘start-up’ visa.

The allegations

Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal

Settlement and mediation

The Australian Information Commissioner announced on Tuesday that it has withdrawn its civil penalty proceedings against Meta Platforms , following a $31.85 million (A$50 million) settlement by the Facebook parent company. The lawsuit, originally filed in 2020, centered on allegations that Meta had shared personal user data with the "" This is Your Digital Life "" personality quiz app, a key element of the wider Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal.The lawsuit accused Meta of violating Australian privacy laws by disclosing the personal information of over 300,000 Australian users to the quiz app between 2014 and 2015. This disclosure was alleged to have occurred without the users' consent, as part of the broader controversy surrounding the misuse of data by the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica .According to the Australian Information Commissioner, Meta breached Australian Privacy Principle 6 by using the data for purposes other than what it was originally collected for, and failed to take reasonable steps to protect user data, violating Privacy Principle 11.1(b).The data misuse controversy first emerged in early 2018, with the Guardian reporting that Cambridge Analytica had harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users. Though 270,000 users consented to data collection via the ""This Is Your Digital Life"" app, the data of approximately 50 million users was ultimately exploited, allegedly to create voter profiles and target political ads.The scandal drew scrutiny globally, leading to fines for Facebook in the United States and the UK in 2019. Australia's privacy regulator launched its legal action against Meta in 2020, claiming that the data of 311,127 Australian Facebook users was exposed to the risk of unauthorized disclosure.Following the legal proceedings, Australia's federal court ordered Meta and the privacy commissioner to enter mediation in June 2023. The settlement reached in the mediation process marks the largest ever payment in Australia dedicated to addressing privacy concerns, according to Australian Information Commissioner Elizabeth Tydd.Meta spokespersons confirmed that the company settled the lawsuit ""on a no admission basis,"" signaling the closure of this chapter on past practices. Despite the settlement, the company’s involvement in the data scandal continues to affect its reputation worldwide.","Facebook settles with Meta Platforms for $31.85 million (A$50 million) The lawsuit centered on allegations that Meta shared personal user data with the ""This is Your Digital Life "" personality quiz app. The lawsuit accused Meta of violating Australian privacy laws by disclosing the personal information of over 300,000 Australian users to the quiz app between 2014 and 2015.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116383780,imgsize-468196,width-400,resizemode-4/116383780.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview.That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

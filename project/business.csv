Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 went below 25,200, BSE Sensex was down over 700 points intraday. Nifty50 closed the day at 25,149.85, down 205 points or 0.81%. BSE Sensex was at 82,500.47, down 690 points or 0.83%.Major stock indices Nifty50 and BSE Sensex fell for the third consecutive session on Friday, declining approximately 1 per cent due to substantial selling in IT, auto and energy sectors. Analysts noted that uncertainties regarding tariffs and mixed global market conditions contributed to the downward pressure.Notable declines were seen in Mahindra & Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Titan, HCL Tech, Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries, Trent, Infosys and HDFC Bank.Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) shares rose 4.61 per cent after announcing Priya Nair as their first woman CEO and MD, effective August 1, 2025. Positive performers included Axis Bank, NTPC, Eternal and State Bank of India.Among Sensex companies, Tata Consultancy Services saw a 3.46 per cent decline following its June quarter results.""The domestic market experienced a negative close due to a sober start to Q1 earnings season and a ramp-up in the tariff threat by the US to impose a 35 per cent tariff on Canada.Investors may continue to be focused on quarterly earnings for a buy-on-dips strategy. However, in the near term, the current premium valuation and the global headwinds like low spending and tariff uncertainties may restrain new inflows. The IT index underperformed due to deferment in orders and new investments, which may impact FY26 earnings estimates,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said.The broader market sentiment weakened following TCS's underwhelming Q1FY26 performance, particularly on the revenue front. The company's shares declined by 2.5% to Rs 3,297 after announcing results. Despite reporting a net profit increase of 6% year-on-year to Rs 12,760 crore, which marginally exceeded expectations, the company registered a 3.1% year-on-year decrease in constant currency revenue.The global economic uncertainty has led clients to postpone non-essential technology investments, prompting financial analysts to reduce their FY26 earnings projections. This negative sentiment affected the entire IT sector, with companies like Infosys, Wipro, LTIMindtree, and Tech Mahindra experiencing declines of 1-3%. Consequently, the Nifty IT index recorded a 2.1% decrease.The US President Donald Trump revealed plans to implement a 35% tariff on Canadian imports in the coming month, alongside potential tariffs of 15%-20% on other significant trading partners. This declaration has triggered concerns about an escalating trade conflict, negatively impacting global market confidence.The markets responded swiftly, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures experiencing a 0.4% decline, matched by a similar drop in EUROSTOXX 50 futures. Trump had earlier in the week delayed certain tariffs until August 1 to facilitate discussions, but subsequently widened the scope of duties affecting key allies, including Japan and South Korea.Oil values increased following Trump's indication of an upcoming announcement regarding Russia, leading to speculation about additional sanctions.Brent crude reached $68.83 per barrel, whilst US WTI crude advanced to $66.81. The prospect of restricted supply drove oil prices upwards, though increases were limited by worries over expanding OPEC+ production and persistent trade-related ambiguity.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex fell for the third consecutive session on Friday, declining approximately 1 per cent due to substantial selling in IT, auto and energy sectors.

Stock market recommendations:Indian equity benchmarks traded within a narrow consolidation band last week, reflecting subdued investor sentiment amid heightened uncertainty surrounding the India-US trade negotiations and the commencement of the Q1 FY26 earnings season. Market activity was largely stock-specific, driven by bottom-up themes, as participants remained cautious, awaiting concrete cues on both macro and micro fronts.Key point to highlight is that index over past 8 sessions has not even retraced 38.20% of preceding 10 sessions up move. Slower pace of retracement approaching indicates robust price structure that bodes well for the next leg of up move. The index is sustaining well above the recent consolidation breakout making higher base and staged a strong rebound indicating inherent strength.We anticipate the index to gradually trend higher and retest the 25,800 zone in the coming weeks, provided it continues to sustain above the crucial support band of 25,000–25,200. Key positional support is placed at 25,200–25,000, which coincides with the 20-day EMA, key retracement area and the upper edge of the prior consolidation zone (25,200–24,500).From a seasonality standpoint, July has historically been a favorable month for the Nifty, delivering positive returns 71% of the time since 1991, with an average gain of 2.5%.Structurally, the index has sustained its upward momentum over the past three months, demonstrating resilience amid a backdrop of geopolitical headwinds and evolving clarity on trade tariff dynamics. Notably, market internals have continued to strengthen during this period. Breadth indicators reflect a broadening of participation, with approximately 63% of Nifty 500 constituents now trading above their 200-day EMA—an improvement from 52% recorded last month—signaling improving market health and supporting the sustainability of the ongoing uptrend.Bank Nifty traded within a narrow consolidation band last week, reflecting subdued investor sentiment amid heightened uncertainty surrounding the India-US trade negotiations and the commencement of the Q1 FY26 earnings season.The index continues to trade above its 20-day EMA—a level it has consistently respected since April—signaling that the underlying bullish trend remains firmly intact. This, combined with improving market breadth, reinforces the higher high–higher low-price structure, suggesting a well-entrenched uptrend. The setup paves the way for a potential move towards the 58,500 zone in the upcoming quarter.On the downside, a strong support base is established at 55,500–56,000, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the 53,483–57,628 rally and aligns with the 50-day EMA. Any pullback towards this zone is likely to be viewed as a buying opportunity within the broader uptrend.Structurally, Bank Nifty is undergoing a phase-wise expansion, characterized by incremental price acceptance at higher levels. Rather than sharp directional spikes, the index is progressing through short consolidations, which are acting as springboards for subsequent upswings. This evolution from high-volatility moves to range-bound accumulation phases signals increasing market maturity. The tightening of correction ranges suggests supply is being absorbed by stronger hands, thereby maintaining trend continuity and enhancing the sustainability of the rally.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Equitas Small Finance Bank, and Medi Assist Healthcare Services are the top stock picks for today.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have an underlying positive bias and experts believe that buying on dips may be the correct strategy for now.Gold prices have shown a decisive recovery from recent lows, with the MCX Gold August Futures (05AUG2025) currently trading around ₹97,247. The underlying tone remains positive, supported by a steady climb above key short-term moving averages. With momentum indicators turning favorable, the intraday bias shifts towards a Buy on Dip strategy near ₹97,000, with downside risk capped around ₹96,450.The 8-period EMA stands at ₹96,900, while the 21-period EMA is at ₹96,700.

A brief consolidation or minor pullback near ₹97,000 can allow the RSI to cool off, offering a renewed entry opportunity.The MACD is inferred to be in a positive crossover state, backed by the recent trend reversal and price closing above key averages. The histogram likely reflects increasing bullish momentum.The latest candle shows a strong bullish body with a narrow upper wick, suggesting firm buying interest at the open. The price closing above the high-volume congestion zone confirms a breakout with strength.Gold intraday bias remains bullish. Traders can adopt a Buy on Dip strategy near the ₹97,000 mark, placing a protective stop-loss at ₹96,450.

UK economy worries: May GDP contracts 0.1% for second straight month; BoE rate cut seen likely amid fiscal strain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-economy-may-gdp-dips-0-1-for-second-straight-month-boe-rate-cut-likely-amid-fiscal-pressure/articleshow/122386231.cms,"Britain’s economy contracted for the second consecutive month in May, dealing a blow to finance minister Rachel Reeves as she navigates a shaky domestic recovery and heightened global uncertainty. Official figures released on Friday showed that gross domestic product (GDP) declined 0.1% in May, following a 0.3% drop in April.The latest reading came as a surprise to economists polled by Reuters, who had expected a 0.1% increase in GDP. While the services sector managed a marginal gain, declines in industrial output and construction dragged overall growth into negative territory, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.The data casts doubt on whether the economy expanded in the second quarter of 2025, and has strengthened expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates next month. “The lack of momentum in the UK economy indicated by these sluggish figures means that an August interest rate cut currently looks inevitable, despite the recent spike in inflation,” said Suren Thiru, economics director at accountancy body ICAEW.Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government, which took office earlier this year, has yet to deliver a meaningful boost to growth. Economists say finance minister Reeves may now be forced to consider tax hikes in her next budget, despite earlier hopes to avoid them.“While today’s figures are disappointing, I am determined to kickstart economic growth and deliver on that promise,” Reeves said in response to the ONS release.Britain had posted a strong performance in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing other G7 economies. In May, the BoE raised its full-year growth forecast to 1%. However, much of the Q1 surge was attributed to temporary factors — including a rush to close home purchases before the expiry of a tax break in April and accelerated exports to beat rising US tariffs.The BoE estimates second-quarter GDP growth at around 0.25%. To meet that target, the ONS said, June would need to show at least flat monthly growth, assuming no revisions to previous months. A contraction of 0.4% or more in June would result in a quarterly decline.“The second straight decline in monthly real GDP in May will increase concerns that the government’s growth plan has been derailed by external and domestic shocks,” said Raj Badiani, economics director for Europe at S&P Global Market Intelligence, quoted Reuters.","Britain's economy contracted for the second consecutive month in May.

Volume Growth Gap

Online Vs Mainstream

Distribution Power

MUMBAI: The grocery bag of urban and rural shoppers is undergoing a divide. Urban Indians are gravitating towards unbranded products in select categories and are also experimenting with new-age brands, while rural consumers are taking to legacy FMCG brands.While there is a big market for unbranded goods in rural, it is losing out to the distribution strength of companies like Nestle, Dabur, and HUL, which are rapidly expanding their rural coverage. For digital-first brands, it will take years, if not decades, to reach this scale.Call it the impact of high inflation seen in the past few quarters or a growing knack for experimentation within urban consumers partly fuelled by online boom, unbranded products are growing faster in cities. A report released by Kantar last month showed that unbranded products recorded an 8.4% volume growth in urban India in FY25 compared to rural's 2.3% growth rate. On the contrary, the volume growth recorded by the 22 listed FMCG companies (only those which contribute to volume growth of the industry meaningfully have been captured) stood at 2.1% in urban regions; in rural areas, the number touched 5.1%.""Currently, about 26% of the FMCG volumes come from the unbranded segment in urban India...they are strong in categories like atta, rice, spices, edible oils, and floor cleaners. Price plays a big role in picking up unbranded products in segments like floor cleaners, and inflation likely nudged more metro shoppers to shift to unbranded goods. However, unbranded doesn't always mean it is cheap. In categories such as coffee, while unbranded is relatively a smaller portion, people go for unbranded for its taste and aroma,"" Manoj Menon, director, commercial at Kantar Worldpanel, South Asia, told TOI.Rural India has been growing faster than its urban counterpart for five consecutive quarters, data released by NielsenIQ for the March quarter showed, as high inflation nudged urban shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending, move to smaller packs, and at times look for cheaper alternatives. A good monsoon last year and govt policies supported rural incomes. There have been some initial signs of recovery, though, with urban volume growth picking up in the June quarter, companies said.For traditional FMCG players, the challenge is on two fronts - getting people to move from unbranded to branded consumption and keeping up pace with an influx of new-age or digital-first brands, many of which are tapping into spaces and trends big players failed to capture. Take Slurrp Farm, for instance, which started building millet-based products much before they became part of mainstream conversations. The brand, which sells both online and offline, gets more reach and revenues from digital, with quick commerce now contributing 35-40% of total sales, said co-founders Meghana Narayan and Shauravi Malik.The rise of online shopping in urban India has given a space to new-age brands in the game. ""More prominently in urban India, consumers are trading up across categories. They are growing out of FMCG brands of the past. Product discovery is happening online, and many of the new-age brands are not yet available in general trade,"" said Mayank Rastogi, markets leader, strategy and transactions practice at EY India.Big companies have built brands to solve for customers across strata; their businesses are not configured to solve for quick innovation. ""D2C new-age brands with their succeed or fail-fast DNA are quick to change product formulations, packaging,"" said Rastogi. The availability of brands (on digital) and the proliferation of advertising into mobile phones are shifting perceptions on branding among urban shoppers who are becoming more ""brand agnostic,"" Kantar said.Companies are building different strategies to win in urban and rural India. Britannia is making digital-first launches in big urban metros to cater to premium and convenience-seeking consumers. In rural areas, the firm is expanding distribution, said Vipin Kataria, chief commercial officer, sales & replenishment at the company. A lot of ITC's new products in urban areas today are quick commerce first, said Sandeep Sule, divisional chief executive, trade marketing & distribution, FMCG at ITC. For rural areas, the strategy is to innovate across product formats and price points.Dabur is expanding its rural basket by way of affordable and rural-specific packs. ""The rural consumers across all income segments are exhibiting a marked propensity towards spending on premium, high-quality products which are backed by strong brand values, even at a high price,"" said CEO Mohit Malhotra. ""While quick commerce is an emerging channel (in urban areas), it currently addresses more impulse and top-up needs,"" said Angshu Mallick, MD & CEO at AWL Agri Business.","Rural India has been growing faster than its urban counterpart for five consecutive quarters. Unbranded products recorded an 8.4% volume growth in urban India in FY25 compared to rural's 2.3% growth rate. For digital-first brands, it will take years, if not decades, to reach this scale.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122397154,imgsize-1569029,width-400,resizemode-4/122397154.jpg"
Tesla's 1st India showroom opens next week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/teslas-1st-india-showroom-opens-next-week/articleshow/122397064.cms,"Representative image

Tesla will open its first showroom in India on Tuesday and begin deliveries as early as next month, people familiar with the matter said, as the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker looks to tap potential demand in the third-largest automobile market to counter slowing sales elsewhere.The opening of the Mumbai showroom will mark the formal entry of Tesla into the market, giving prospective customers access to pricing, available variants, and trim options, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private, as well as documents seen by Bloomberg.Deliveries are expected to start from late Aug, a separate person familiar with the development said. Customers will be able to configure and order their Tesla EVs from next week, the person added.Bloomberg first reported last month that the Mumbai showroom was gearing up for a mid-July opening and the first set of cars - Model Y rear-wheel drive SUVs shipped from Tesla's China factory - had arrived in the country.A second Tesla showroom - this one in New Delhi - is poised to open in late July, the people said.Tesla's long-awaited entry into the Indian market comes at a crucial time for the EV maker, which saw a slump in global sales in the second quarter that ran counter to Musk's claim that business had recovered from blowback over his work in the Trump administration.Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to an email seeking comments on the India rollout plans.The Model Y is the world's top-selling electric car and its popularity in India will offer insight on consumers' acceptance of high import duties. Hefty tariffs had been a major factor weighing on Tesla's decision around when to enter the Indian market, CFO Vaibhav Taneja said during the automaker's first-quarter earnings call.Documents reviewed by Bloomberg last month show five Model Y units were declared at approximately Rs 27.7 lakh ($32,270) each. Taking into account India's 70% import tariff on fully-built imported cars under $40,000, plus additional surcharges, the cars are likely to sell at a substantial premium to the roughly $46,630 they go for in the US.The first week of the Mumbai showroom's operations will focus on VIPs and business partners, with the general public being granted access the following week, said the people familiar with the plans.","Tesla will open its first showroom in India on Tuesday and begin deliveries as early as next month, people familiar with the matter said.

India-US trade deal:

'Closer': Donald Trump's Big Hint On India-US Trade Deal Amid High Tariff Slapped On Other Nations

India, US near trade deal. What happens next if New Delhi joins Trump’s shortlist?



United States is working toward an interim trade agreement with India that could reduce proposed tariffs to below 20%. This would give India a more favourable position compared to other countries in the region.Unlike many nations, India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement, Bloomberg reported, quoting sources.The proposed interim trade deal between the two nations would allow both the sides to continue negotiations, giving India time to address unresolved issues before a broader agreement expected later this year, the source added.The planned agreement is likely to set a baseline tariff of under 20%, down from the 26% initially proposed, with provisions to allow further adjustments as part of a final pact. However, the exact timeline for the interim deal remains uncertain.If finalised, India would likely join a select group of nations that have reached trade arrangements with the Trump administration. In contrast, several other countries were hit with surprise tariff hikes of up to 50% this week, ahead of the August 1 deadline.India is pushing for a more favourable deal than the one signed with Vietnam, which included 20% tariffs. Vietnam, caught off guard by the high rate, is now seeking a revision. So far, only the UK has officially signed trade deals with the Trump administration.Earlier on Thursday, Trump told NBC News that he is considering imposing blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on most trading partners who haven't yet received specific rates.Currently, the baseline tariff for most US trade partners stands at 10%. For Asian countries, announced rates so far include 20% for Vietnam and the Philippines, and as high as 40% for Laos and Myanmar.Despite being among the earliest to initiate trade discussions this year, India-US relations have shown recent tensions.While Trump indicates an imminent agreement, he has also suggested additional tariffs regarding India's BRICS membership.An Indian negotiation team is expected to visit Washington soon to push forward trade talks. India has already made its final offer to the Trump administration and outlined its non-negotiable positions.The key sticking points remain, including the US demand for India to allow genetically modified (GM) crops, something New Delhi has firmly opposed, citing concerns for farmers. Other unresolved issues include non-tariff barriers in agriculture and regulatory challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.","India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement.

SEBI Unveils ‘Valid’ UPI System to Protect Investors from Fraud in Capital Markets Starting Oct 1

NEW DELHI: The rise in UPI payments has helped reduce use of cash in India, a new paper by a team from IMF has said, while using proxies, such as cash withdrawal from ATMs and currency in circulation as a proportion of GDP.""Since its launch in 2016, UPI has grown quickly, while some proxies for cash usage have begun to decline. UPI now processes more than 18 billion transactions per month and dominates other electronic retail payments in India. India now makes faster payments than any other country,"" it said. The paper has strongly backed interoperable payment systems, such as UPI, arguing that these systems allow seamless payments between users of different payment providers.The ecosystem has now grown to reach over 600 banks and 200 apps. When UPI was launched, initially more than half the users flocked to their banks and accessed it through their bank apps as they trusted these entities.

NEW DELHI: Union minister H D Kumaraswamy on Friday launched the first scheme to provide customer facing incentives on purchase of electric trucks of up to Rs 9.6 lakh per vehicle as part of govt's PM E-DRIVE initiative, which has earmarked Rs 500 crore for electric trucks out of its Rs 10,900 crore outlay.Industries including ports, logistics, cement and steel will be the key beneficiaries of the scheme, which envisages support of up to 5,600 electric trucks.""Diesel trucks, though constituting only 3% of the total vehicle population, contribute to 42% of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions and significantly worsen air pollution.

on table

NEW DELHI: The GST Council, which will meet shortly, is expected to comprehensively review the eight-year-old regime focused on reducing tax on several consumer-focused items in the 12% bracket as well as lowering the burden on items such as air conditioners, which are in the top bracket.Besides, with the compensation cess - money released to states to offset any revenue loss because of switch to GST - due to end in March, a plan on imposing a cess on some of the sin goods, such as tobacco, is also expected to be finalised to ensure that states don't have to bear a significant revenue hit.Concern that they will be losing out on revenue has been among the principal factors why states oppose tax cuts, including those which they consider to be desirable.The Centre is keen on a liberal view on pure term insurance plans, which currently attract 18% GST and put it in the nil bracket, although the life insurance companies have lobbied for 12%.Any reduction in GST on insurance will mean big relief, with the Centre keen to protect the interests of middle-class buyers.A call on health insurance too, is yet to be taken, although relief is in the offing.A proposal to do away with the 12% slab is on the table although other options are also being explored while keeping track of the revenue consideration, sources told TOI.Some of the items in the bracket which are used by businesses may see some increase, the sources indicated.A final decision on the overhaul is expected before the start of the monsoon session and the Centre is not averse to some ""revenue loss"" with a section arguing that a pure mathematical exercise does not fully capture the revenue realisation. Increased consumption of some of the items with lower taxes may actually benefit, offsetting some of the expected revenue loss.This may also require some political maneuvering and working out a consensus, which will be taken up once the broad arrangement is worked out.While discussions have been going on for over a year now, a consensus has so far been elusive with the group of ministers on GST rationalisation and changes in insurance not throwing up solutions - suggesting tweaks instead of broad-based changes as is the intent. Sources suggested that the idea is to put in place a framework that does not require frequent tweaks and provides certainty to businesses and consumers.","The GST Council, which will meet shortly, is expected to comprehensively review the eight-year-old regime.

One serious contender is starting to dominate that conversation offering something meme coins simply can’t, which is actual utility and 100x potential.Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) may have started as a feel-good meme coin, but traders are now watching it with mixed emotions. The token slid 7.21% in the last 24 hours to $0.01515, with trading volume also down 21%.Despite this dip, its market cap remains just shy of $1 billion, hinting that interest hasn’t fully faded.

Some analysts say it’s now at a technical crossroads, where either renewed meme momentum kicks in or short-term holders begin to rotate out.With speculation swirling around the next 100x play, some traders are starting to question if tokens like Pudgy can hold ground against more grounded, utility-first projects.Dogecoin is making noise again with a 6.6% jump, lifting it to $0.1743 and pushing daily trading volume past $1.2 billion.

How companies are reacting to tariffs and what it means for consumer prices

President Donald Trump has sharply expanded a barrage of tariffs since returning to office, aiming to overhaul global trade in favour of the United States. The sweeping measures, which target a broad range of foreign goods and industries, have triggered market fluctuations and strained ties with key American allies.In his latest announcement, Trump said Canada would face a 35% tariff on many goods, citing the country’s alleged role in enabling fentanyl trafficking into the US. The move came just a day after he imposed a sweeping 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil.Trump claimed the Brazil tariff was partly a response to the ongoing trial of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who faces charges related to a failed coup attempt. Reacting strongly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vowed retaliation, stating that Brazil ""will not accept being abused by anyone.""Trump also plans to impose a 50% tariff on all copper imports starting August 1, citing national security concerns. The decision could raise costs for US industries reliant on the metal, especially manufacturing and construction.Trump has escalated trade tensions by sending tariff letters to more than 20 countries, warning that higher import duties will take effect from August 1, 2025 if bilateral trade deals are not reached.The move marks a continuation of his aggressive ""reciprocal tariff"" policy first announced in April this year. The letters outline specific tariff rates, some adjusted from earlier levels.Many of the new tariff rates echo those Trump proposed in April, before temporarily suspending them, except for China, to give nations time to negotiate trade deals, according to The New York Times.So far, two countries have managed to reach agreements with the US. A deal with the UK will lower tariffs on cars, steel, and aerospace parts. Another agreement with Vietnam sets a 20% tariff on general imports and a 40% duty on transshipped goods, lower than the initially planned 46%.Meanwhile, representatives from Japan, the EU, Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia, and others have been meeting US officials to avoid the looming hikes.India is also stepping up talks. A commerce ministry team is expected to visit Washington next week for another round of discussions over the proposed bilateral trade agreement.While exact dates are yet to be confirmed, officials say the focus will be on finalising both interim and phase-one parts of the deal ahead of the tariff deadline, according to sources quoted by PTI.In June, the US doubled tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%. Trump said the move was aimed at countering countries that ""undercut the competitiveness"" of American industries.While intended to protect domestic producers, the higher tariffs are likely to increase costs for US companies that depend on these metals, such as automakers, construction firms, and oil drillers. Consumers may also see higher prices on goods like canned foods.All cars assembled outside the US and all imported auto parts now face a 25% duty. Trump claims the tariffs will boost investment and create jobs in the US, but analysts warn they could significantly raise new car prices and repair costs for consumers.In May, Trump closed the “de minimis” rule, which had allowed retailers to ship goods from abroad—especially China—directly to US buyers without paying tariffs (for packages under $800).The rule helped e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu flourish, but made it hard for US producers to compete. The closure is expected to slow down cheap imports but may also lead to higher prices for online shoppers.He has also issued a warning to the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), threatening an additional 10% tariff on ""any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS.""The European Union is also on Trump’s radar. He claimed the EU was ""formed to screw the US"" and threatened a 50% tariff if trade terms aren’t renegotiated.Trump believes the US trade deficit—when America imports more than it exports—is a sign of economic failure. He sees tariffs as a way to punish countries for ""ripping off"" the US and to bring back jobs and manufacturing.His administration claims that by making imports more expensive, companies will be forced to produce goods domestically, boosting employment and wages.But Trump also uses tariffs as leverage—to push countries into trade deals, extract concessions, or generate revenue that can be used for domestic programs like tax cuts.Experts argue that Trump’s tariff goals are conflicting. While he wants to boost US manufacturing, the higher costs of imported materials like steel and semiconductors can actually hurt American producers by raising their production costs and disrupting supply chains.A tariff is a tax that the government charges on goods brought in from other countries. In the US , these tariffs are paid by American importers—not foreign exporters—and the money collected goes directly to the US Treasury.For example, if Walmart imports shoes worth $100 from Myanmar, which now faces a 40% tariff, the company must pay $40 to the government, The New York Times reported.Walmart’s CEO recently warned that rising tariffs would likely lead to price hikes, prompting former President Trump to publicly urge the company to “eat the tariffs” and avoid raising prices.The ripple effects of tariffs are being felt across supply chains. With the US heavily reliant on Chinese factories for products like toys and Christmas decorations, many businesses have begun pausing holiday orders. Toymaker Mattel has already announced it will raise prices on US toys in response to tariffs on Chinese imports.While tariffs are known to drive up consumer prices, major inflation indicators like the Consumer Price Index have yet to reflect a sharp increase.Economists suggest it's only a matter of time. Many companies stocked up on inventory ahead of tariff hikes, helping delay price increases, but as those supplies run out, consumers may soon see the difference at checkout.","President Donald Trump has sharply expanded a barrage of tariffs since returning to office.

'Closer': Donald Trump's Big Hint On India-US Trade Deal Amid High Tariff Slapped On Other Nations

NEW DELHI: Further talks on the India-US trade deal are lined up in the coming days with negotiators once again headed to Washington as the government seeks to finalise an agreement, without any deadline pressure.""We are not differentiating between an interim or the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement. We are negotiating a complete deal. Whatever will be finalised, we can package it as an interim deal, and for the rest, talks will continue,"" said an official, days after President Donald Trump announced that US was ""close to making a deal with India"".Earlier this year, Trump and PM Modi had set a deadline for finalising a trade deal by September-October but with reciprocal tariffs announced, an interim tranche or a mini deal entered the picture. While Trump has been sending letters to countries setting revised reciprocal tariffs effective Aug 1, India is so far not on the list.But month-end is seen as the latest deadline to offer concessions in areas of interest to the US. In India's case, it is agriculture that is of prime interest, along with American whiskey and automobiles, but the government is reluctant to lower tariffs on farm goods. Besides, commerce minister Piyush Goyal has said that the government will not be bound by deadlines and will ensure that India's interest remains paramount.On Monday, Rajesh Agarwal, India’s chief negotiator for the US trade deal, said the government is trying to negotiate and finalise a trade agreement.Having implemented 14 free trade agreements with 26 countries, he said, “Now, we are integrating with major markets also... we just concluded an agreement with the UK, we are in an advanced stage of negotiations with the European Union, we are trying to negotiate and finalise a deal with the US...”“This will create huge opportunities for India also to become part of global value chains,” he said here at an event on export logistics. Agarwal also listed New Zealand, Chile and Peru among countries with which talks were under way.“Our tariffs will be bilaterally cut... People will be able to make long-term investment decisions based on this predictability of tariff and regulatory landscape... In this logistics will also be a major determinant,” he had said. Besides, he had underlined that the government was working towards lowering logistics costs.","Talks on the India-US trade deal are lined up in the coming days.

Housing squeeze: 30-year US mortgage rate rises to 6.72%; 5-week easing streak ends as borrowing costs inch up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/housing-squeeze-30-year-us-mortgage-rate-rises-to-6-72-5-week-easing-streak-ends-as-borrowing-costs-inch-up/articleshow/122371064.cms,"T he average long-term mortgage rate in the US edged higher this week, ending a five-week streak of easing borrowing costs that had offered some relief to prospective homebuyers.According to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year home loan ticked up to 6.72% from 6.67% last week. A year ago, the rate was higher at 6.89%, AP reported.The increase also extended to 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, often used for refinancing. The average rose to 5.86% from 5.80% a week earlier, compared to 6.17% at this time last year, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.Persistently high borrowing costs have continued to weigh on the housing market, which has been in a sales slump since 2022. “Mortgage rates may come down modestly over the coming months,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, “but other economic headwinds — including the impact of tariffs on consumer goods, weaker labour market conditions and rising consumer debt — could be what continue to hold the housing market in the second half of 2025. ”Despite the recent dip in rates, home prices remain elevated, which has discouraged many buyers.Sales of previously occupied homes last year fell to their lowest in nearly three decades and have remained subdued so far in 2025.Mortgage rates are primarily influenced by movements in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use to price home loans. The yield rose to 4.37% by midday Thursday, up from 4.34% a day earlier. Yields climbed last week after a stronger-than-expected jobs report led traders to bet that the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates on hold.The 30-year mortgage rate has hovered near its 2025 peak of just over 7%, set in January. It briefly dipped to a low of 6.62% in April.Recent easing in rates helped drive a 9.4% jump in mortgage applications last week, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. But economists broadly expect rates to remain in the 6% to 7% range for the rest of the year.","The average rate on a 30-year home loan ticked up to 6.72% from 6.67% last week.

The timing and the circumstances have drawn scrutiny, especially as the electric vehicle maker faces a 27% stock slide this year, driven in part by CEO Elon Musk ’s growing alignment with President Donald Trump and intensifying competition in the EV market.“The annual meeting provides shareholders with the opportunity to hear directly from the board about these concerns, and to vote for or against directors, the board’s approach to executive compensation, and other matters of material importance,” said a letter to the board signed by more than 20 Tesla shareholders. The letter was sent just days before the compliance window closed.The annual gathering is expected to be a turbulent affair, with many investors reportedly unsettled by Musk’s dual focus on politics and side ventures.The meeting could serve as a flashpoint for debate over his leadership and the board’s governance record.On the same day the meeting was announced, Musk also said his AI chatbot Grok would soon be integrated into Tesla vehicles. “Grok is coming to Tesla vehicles very soon. Next week at the latest,” Musk wrote on social media platform X.Grok, developed by Musk’s AI startup xAI, is positioned as a politically unfiltered alternative to other chatbots such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, the rollout has been marred by controversy. On Wednesday, xAI confirmed it was taking down “inappropriate posts” made by Grok that reportedly included antisemitic messages praising Adolf Hitler.Tesla shares briefly rebounded 3% at the opening bell on Thursday, after sharp declines earlier in the week when Musk’s feud with Trump again captured headlines.","Tesla has scheduled its annual shareholder meeting for November 6.

These figures offer another sign of strength in the country’s labour market even as major companies announce job cuts and concerns grow over the economic impact of tariffs.According to data released by the US labour department on Thursday, initial applications for unemployment aid fell by 5,000 to 227,000 in the week ending July 5, below the 238,000 predicted by analysts, AP reported.Jobless claims are closely watched as an indicator of layoffs.This follows last week’s report showing that US employers added a stronger-than-expected 147,000 jobs in June. The national unemployment rate edged down to 4.1%, improving slightly from May’s 4.2% figure. Many analysts had anticipated a rise to 4.3%, but the labour market once again showed unexpected resilience, despite growing uncertainty over US president Donald Trump’s economic policies.Still, signs of strain are emerging. The ongoing uncertainty over Trump’s policies, particularly his use of aggressive tariffs, is causing unease among businesses. Most economists argue that such tariffs reduce competition and make the economy less efficient.They also risk triggering retaliatory measures from other countries, which could hurt US exporters and prompt businesses to halt hiring or reduce their workforce.Unless fresh trade agreements are reached, the bulk of Trump's proposed tariffs, now extended until 1 August, could weigh further on economic momentum and rekindle inflationary pressures, economists warn.A number of major firms have already announced job reductions this year. Microsoft revealed last week it will cut around 9,000 jobs, marking its second large-scale layoff in recent months and the biggest in over two years. Google, meanwhile, confirmed fresh buyouts in June as part of its continued cost-cutting efforts.Other companies trimming their workforce include Meta (Facebook’s parent company), Procter & Gamble, Starbucks, CNN, Workday, Dow, and Southwest Airlines.While short-term volatility in claims is common, the four-week moving average, considered a more reliable measure, also fell by 5,750 to 235,500.However, the number of Americans continuing to receive unemployment benefits rose by 10,000 to 1.97 million for the week ending June 28, the highest figure since November 2021.","Initial applications for unemployment aid fell by 5,000 to 227,000 in the week ending July 5, below the 238,000 predicted by analysts.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

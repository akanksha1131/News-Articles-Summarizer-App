Trump’s trade deals: Japan charms with $490 bn deal but South Korea in doubt; what's the holdup?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-trade-deals-japan-charms-with-490-bn-deal-but-south-korea-in-doubt-whats-the-holdup/articleshow/124887262.cms,"‘Ghost Of Biden’ Haunts Trump? US President’s WEIRD Walk In Tokyo Stuns Japanese PM

Japan signs the deal—Why is Seoul cautious?

Ties gone cold?









After wrapping up a visit to Japan that delivered $490 billion in investment commitments, US President Donald Trump is heading into a more complicated negotiation in South Korea, where a trade agreement remains out of reach.Trump will be meeting South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday in Gyeongju, the historic host city of this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. The talks come as both governments acknowledge that discussions have slowed over a central demand from Trump, which is that South Korea invest $350 billion in the United States.Officials in Seoul have argued that the scale and method of investment Washington wants could harm their domestic economy and are urging a structure based on loans and loan guarantees, rather than an upfront cash commitment. They further added that a currency swap line would be necessary to manage capital movement into the US.Oh Hyunjoo, a deputy national security director, said progress has been slower than expected.“We haven’t yet been able to reach an agreement on matters such as the structure of investments, their formats and how the profits will be distributed,” she told AP Monday.The debate threatens to overshadow Trump’s time in South Korea, particularly in contrast to his stop in Japan, where the atmosphere appeared more harmonious.As part of an earlier trade agreement, Japan had pledged $550 billion in investment. During a dinner with Japanese business leaders in Tokyo, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that commitments had reached up to $490 billion.Trump also spent time with Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, joining her aboard an aircraft carrier to address US troops and unveiling Japanese-backed energy and technology projects in America.However, the road ahead of the South Korea meeting is remarkably different. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, speaking aboard Air Force One, declined to present an imminent deal, saying only, “Just a lot of details to work out,” though he noted both sides were close.Until a trade deal is finalised, South Korea is subject to a 25% tariff on automobiles shipped to the United States, notably higher than the 15% tariff applied to Japanese and European vehicles. The higher tariff continues to disadvantage companies including Hyundai and Kia.Trump and Lee began their strategic relationship on a positive note when Lee entered office in June, with a warm White House meeting in August.However, the ties have since strained, particularly after the US immigration raid in September at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, where more than 300 South Koreans were detained and deported. The incident fuelled anger in Seoul and raised questions over future corporate investment in America.Lee warned that without visa improvements, companies may withdraw or reconsider plans.“If that’s not possible, then establishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,” he said.“They will wonder whether they should even do it.”South Korea’s foreign ministry later said the US had agreed to allow South Korean workers to use short-term visas or a visa waiver programme to support industrial projects in America.Trump, when asked about the raid, distanced himself from the decision, “I was opposed to getting them out,” he said, adding that improved visa rules would make it easier for companies to bring in skilled workers.Trump’s visit, alongside trade discussions, also included sensitive diplomatic engagements. On Thursday, he is expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping, with both countries signalling readiness to ease tensions after recent trade disagreements.He added that he would extend his trip with South Korea as his final scheduled stop, if there was a chance for the two to talk. The leaders had last met during Trump’s first term, though their discussions produced no agreement on North Korea’s nuclear programme.","US President Donald Trump will meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday in Gyeongju.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold & Silver lost their festive shine in the last week, tumbling from record highs & snapping a nine-week rally as trade optimism between India - China amid falling global prices & easing global shortage in Silver market triggered profit-booking by investors.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for December delivery plummeted by 2.80 per cent last week as Silver futures also succumbed to profit-taking, with the December contract crashing by almost 6 %. Both metals had been on a rise since the week ended on August 22 till Diwali festive.Gold selling also persisted this week as signs of easing trade tensions between the US & China continued to undermine demand for traditional safe-haven assets. The downfall led to an over three-week low which could also be attributed to technical selling following an intraday failure to find acceptance above the $4,000 psychological mark.Meanwhile, dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations dragged the US Dollar (USD) lower this week, though it did little to lend any support to Gold. Even economic risks stemming from a prolonged US government shutdown failed to provide any respite for the bulls. This backs the case for further losses as the focus shifts to a two-day FOMC meeting ahead this week.Bullions are expected to trade with potential for further losses in the current week amid upcoming global central bank meetings. On Wednesday, the Fed will announce its monetary policy decision following a two-day meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows that markets are fully pricing in a 25-basis-points (bps) interest rate cut. Because such a decision is unlikely to trigger a market reaction, investors will scrutinize the tone of policy statement & comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the post-meeting press conference.Renewed optimism about US - China trade discussions could also cap safe-haven flows to gold. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier stated on Sunday that the US and China could agree on the framework of a potential trade deal that will be discussed when US President Donald Trump & Chinese President Xi Jinping meet later this week. This, in turn, remains supportive of the upbeat mood around the equity markets and might hold back traders from placing fresh bullish bets around the bullions pair heading into this week's key central bank event risks.Spot Silver also continued to decline this week hitting a one-month low at $45.56 earlier in the day as the market entered a normalization phase after a record wave of free-floating metal inflows into London vaults, reducing the need for elevated prices to attract additional supply. The drop also came amid softer Indian demand post end of Diwali festival amid speculative position unwinding and easing physical activities continue to drive prices down.Spot gold is expected to trade with limited upside bias as a breach of $ 4000 /Oz psychological support this week now gives way to $ 3850 – 3730 /Oz next support levels which may be translated to Rs. 1,15,800 - 1,14,200 / 10 gm. supports MCX to be tested this week.Spot Silver on the other hand could now likely decline towards $ 44 - 45 /Oz support in near term translating to levels of Rs. 1,37,000 - 1,36,000 on MCX futures contract.","Gold and silver prices may continue to decline in the near term as appeal for safe haven assets reduces, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

Trump-Kim Summit 2.0? 'Love Letters', Nukes & Russia: Why The Reunion May Never Happen





US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to discuss a proposed trade framework on Thursday that could see Washington reduce tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Beijing’s commitment to curb exports of fentanyl precursor chemicals, according to The Wall Street Journal.As per The Wall Street Journal report cited by news agency Reuters, the plan under discussion would involve the US rolling back a portion of its 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports by up to 10% if China pledges stricter controls on precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl, a synthetic opioid blamed for hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in recent years.The meeting between Trump and Xi is expected to take place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, marking their first in-person engagement since Trump’s return to the White House in January.Earlier, Trump told reporters before departing on his Asia visit that “we have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us… I think we’ll have a good meeting.”Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated in recent months, with Trump threatening new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods from November 1 after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths — minerals crucial for smartphones and defence equipment.China has justified the restrictions as measures to protect “national security.”Trump has repeatedly pressed Beijing to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States, while also seeking trade concessions that could help American farmers. “I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal,” he said earlier, noting that soy trade and Chinese purchases of Russian oil could also be discussed.China’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang recently said both sides had reached “a preliminary consensus on a range of issues.”Markets are watching the meeting closely amid hopes it could help resolve the ongoing trade war that has rattled the global economy.",US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to discuss a proposed trade framework on Thursday.

MCX Gold has started gaining upward momentum after forming a doji candlestick pattern near the crucial support zone around ₹1,17,500 levels, signaling a potential reversal from the recent corrective phase. The doji formation at the bottom indicates indecision among traders, often preceding a change in market direction. Following this pattern, prices have shown renewed strength, suggesting that bullish sentiment is gradually returning to the market.In the coming week, gold prices are expected to move higher towards the ₹1,25,000 mark, supported by improved buying interest and a positive technical setup. On the downside, immediate support is seen around ₹1,19,000, which is likely to act as a strong base for the ongoing recovery. As long as prices hold above this level, the bias is expected to remain positive.A sustained move above ₹1,22,500 could further accelerate the upside momentum, opening the door for higher targets in the short term. Broader factors such as global economic uncertainty, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, and central bank gold purchases are also expected to support the bullish trend. Overall, the outlook for MCX Gold remains optimistic, with traders advised to maintain a buy-on-dips approach while keeping an eye on key support levels.MCX Silver has started to gain strong upward momentum after consolidating in a narrow range over the past few sessions. Prices have now climbed to around ₹1,48,000 levels, reflecting renewed buying interest and improving market sentiment. The recent breakout above the consolidation zone suggests that bulls are gradually regaining control, supported by firm global cues and increasing investor appetite for precious metals.From a technical perspective, the overall bias remains positive as long as prices sustain above the key support level of ₹1,45,000. This zone is expected to act as a solid base for further upside movement. On the higher side, silver prices are likely to face minor resistance near ₹1,50,500, but once this level is decisively breached, the rally could extend towards ₹1,55,000 in the near term.The strengthening of gold prices and expectations of slower rate hikes globally are also lending support to silver. Additionally, industrial demand recovery and a weaker U.S. dollar index could further fuel bullish momentum. Traders are advised to maintain a buy-on-dips approach while keeping stop-losses below ₹1,45,000. Overall, the short-term outlook for MCX Silver remains optimistic, with the potential for prices to test higher resistance levels in the coming sessions.","Gold and silver prices may start exhibiting some strength in the coming days, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

FULL: Trump ‘Buries The Hatchet’ With Xi; Hints At ‘Great Meeting’ At Seoul Summit Amid Tariff War





US President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of a trade deal between US and China as he meets Xi Jinping in South Korea for a high-stakes talks, amid looming tariffs and trade tensions.When asked by a reporter, ""Mr President, do you plan to sign a trade deal today?"" Trump replied saying, ""could-be"". Further making a remark on their ties he added, ""We all have a great understanding.”""""I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it is an honor to have you with us,"" further added Trump, while calling Xi a ""very tough negotiator"", before they went ahead to hold the anticipated talks.Meanwhile, when the two leaders sat down for talks, Xi Jinping seemed to strike a conciliatory tone, reading from prepared remarks that pointed to Beijing’s apparent desire to manage tensions constructively.“Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,” Xi said through a translator. “It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.”Also read: Donald Trump-Xi Jinping meet in South Korea - top quotes The Trump–Xi meeting in Busan comes amid a fragile and complex phase in US–China relations, marked by deep trade frictions, strategic mistrust, and competing economic interests. The two sides have spent months trading tariffs and accusations even as they quietly explore the possibility of a new framework for cooperation.Trade remains the most immediate fault line. Earlier this month, Beijing imposed sweeping export controls on rare earths — a critical sector it dominates and one that underpins global defence, automotive and electronics manufacturing. Washington responded with threats of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods, reviving fears of another tit-for-tat trade spiral. Trump has since softened his position, acknowledging that such duties are “not sustainable” and signalling openness to a compromise.Another key sticking point is fentanyl. Since March, a 20 per cent tariff has stayed in place over what Washington describes as Beijing’s failure to curb the trafficking of the deadly opioid into the United States. But Trump has indicated the tariff could be lowered, citing signs of greater cooperation. Reports suggest Washington may halve fentanyl-related tariffs in exchange for stricter Chinese controls on precursor chemical exports.Beyond tariffs, the Busan meeting carries geopolitical undertones. The United States continues to push China to reduce energy imports from Russia and to maintain restraint over Taiwan, while Beijing seeks a US acknowledgment of its “One China” principle. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently reaffirmed that Washington is “not walking away from Taiwan” even as trade negotiations continue, underlining how hard it will be to separate economics from security.Technology remains another flashpoint. Beijing wants Washington to ease export restrictions on advanced semiconductor chips vital for AI and high-performance computing. American chipmakers have warned that overzealous curbs could erode US competitiveness. Meanwhile, Trump’s order to transfer TikTok’s US operations to a domestic consortium — with a deal reportedly set to be finalised during the Busan talks — adds another layer of symbolism to the economic standoff.Despite these strains, both capitals have reason to de-escalate. Trump faces pressure from US farmers and manufacturers hit by disrupted supply chains, while China wants stability as it battles slowing growth and a property slump. A breakthrough in Busan could reopen tech trade, restore predictability for global markets, and provide political wins for both sides.As Trump put it, the moment could be “something very exciting for everybody” — but the stakes are high. The question now is whether optimism in Busan will translate into an actual deal that resets the tone of one of the world’s most consequential economic relationships.",US President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of a trade deal between US and China as he meets Xi Jinping in South Korea for a high-stakes talks.

UPI surge relegates debit cards mainly to ATM use,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/upi-surge-relegates-debit-cards-mainly-to-atm-use/articleshow/124924043.cms,"



MUMBAI: Debit cards, once the go-to-option for many Indians looking to make payments, are losing out to UPI, which has made buying and paying for things a lot easier. Today, debit cards are largely being used for cash withdrawals and some occasional purchases at stores. Debit cards still account for more than one billion issued units, yet their PoS (point of sale) usage has stagnated, declining nearly 8% y-o-y in the Jan-June period, a report by Worldline India showed. The shift, analysts at the firm said, reflects UPI's cannibalisation of low-ticket merchant payments, especially in everyday categories.In fact, the average ticket size of UPI transactions declined from Rs 1,478 in H1 2024 to Rs 1,348 in H1 2025 pointing to the increasing use of the mode by consumers to shop for groceries, small-ticket items and pay for utility bills and services.""Smaller spends at kiranas, delivery platforms, mobility services and utilities show how QR codes have been normalised as the default payment mode,"" said analysts. A lot of this growth has come on the back of convenience-for merchants, onboarding is near frictionless with zero cost acceptance and instant settlement. For consumers, speed outweighs the use of cards or cash. There is a new hierarchy at play-""UPI owns frequency, credit cards capture value, and debit is relegated to cash withdrawals.For issuers, the challenge is clear-protect relevance in a market where UPI dominates the bottom of the pyramid,"" experts said.In Jan-June, UPI transaction volumes touched 106.4 billion, growing 35% y-o-y while value stood at Rs 143.3 trillion. In contrast, overall PoS volumes grew 4% y-o-y to 2.3 billion in H12025. PoS growth is anchored almost entirely by credit cards, whose volumes grew 25% y-o-y to 1.3 billion; debit card usage fell 24% to 516 million. Debit cards have seen a decline even in online spaces where credit cards continue to thrive, led by premium purchases.

Nvidia made history on Wednesday as the first company to reach $5 trillion in market value, powered by a stunning rally that has cemented its place at the centre of the global artificial intelligence boom.The milestone underscores the company's swift transformation from a niche graphics-chip designer into the backbone of the global AI industry, turning CEO Jensen Huang into a Silicon Valley icon and making its advanced chips a flashpoint in the tech rivalry between the US and China.Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, Nvidia's shares have climbed 12-fold as the AI frenzy propelled the S& to record highs, igniting a debate on whether frothy tech valuations could lead to the next big bubble.The new milestone, coming just three months after Nvidia breached the $4 trillion mark, would surpass the total cryptocurrency market value and equal roughly half the size of Europe's benchmark equities index, the Stoxx 600 index.""Nvidia hitting a $5 trillion market cap is more than a milestone; it's a statement, as Nvidia has gone from chip maker to industry creator,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, which holds shares in the company.""The market continues to underestimate the scale of the opportunity, and Nvidia remains one of the best ways to play the AI theme.""Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company rose 4.6% after a string of recent announcements solidified its dominance in the AI race.Huang unveiled $500 billion in AI chip orders on Tuesday and said he plans to build seven supercomputers for the U.S. government.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is expected to discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chip with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday. Sales of the high-end chip have been a key sticking point between the two sides due to Washington's export controls.At current prices, CEO Huang's stake in Nvidia would be worth about $179.2 billion, according to regulatory filings and Reuters calculations. He is the world's eighth-richest person, per Forbes' billionaire list.Born in Taiwan and raised in the United States from age nine, Huang has led Nvidia since founding it in 1993. Under his leadership, the company's H100 and Blackwell processors have become the engines behind large-language models powering tools like ChatGPT and Elon Musk's xAI.(This is a Reuters story)","N Nvidia becomes first company to reach $5 trillion in market value.

Mehli Mistry exits Tata Trusts: Noel Tata consolidates control; clarity returns to $180-bn group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mehli-mistry-exits-tata-trusts-noel-tata-consolidates-control-clarity-returns-to-180-bn-group/articleshow/124922717.cms,"



MUMBAI: The departure of Mehli Mistry from boards of Tata Trusts not only cements chairman Noel Tata's position within the public charities but also strengthens his influence over the $180-bn Tata Group . It gives Noel greater control over the philanthropic and strategic arms of the Tata empire and enhances his ability to shape key decisions within both the charities and the conglomerate.For months, tensions had simmered within the Trusts with Mistry being seen by some trustees as slowing down decision-making. His exit, they say, restores clarity and authority to the leadership. Divisions became evident in September after non-nominee directors led by Mistry blocked reappointment of Vijay Singh as a nominee director of Trusts on Tata Sons board. The move followed a review of nominee directors who have reached 75 years. Noel and Venu, the other two nominee trustees, didn't support Singh's removal. Non-nominee directors suggested Mistry as Singh's replacement but Noel rejected it. Consequently, Singh, 77, resigned from the board of Tata Sons.With the tradition of unanimity first broken by the Mistry faction, Noel along with Srinivasan and Vijay Singh chose not to approve Mistry's reappointment as a lifelong trustee on the boards of the charities.Mistry had maintained his reappointment was a ""procedural formality,"" referring to a Oct 17, 2024 resolution passed unanimously by the Trusts that said that upon expiry of tenure, a trustee ""will be reappointed by the concerned Trust without any limit being attached to the period of tenure. ""One trustee who opposed Mistry's reappointment said: ""I cannot agree with Mistry's suggestion that all reappointments were already approved on Oct 17. The resolutions cannot be interpreted in a way that reduces critical decisions - such as trustee reappointments - to a formality. Such an interpretation is inconsistent with the law and our fiduciary obligations as trustees.""Another trustee, who also did not back Mistry's reappointment, wrote, ""The decision to reappoint a trustee can never be a procedural formality. Such a suggestion undermines our fiduciary duty and runs contrary to the law.""Three of the other trustees - Pramit Jhaveri, Darius Khambata, and Jehangir Jehangir - had, however, approved Mistry's reappointment. But with no unanimity among trustees, Mistry's three-year term came to an end on Tuesday.Since Noel Tata and Venu Srinivasan are already permanent trustees, the trusteeships of Jhaveri, Singh, and Khambata will come up for renewal over time.The Tata Trusts own two-thirds of Tata Sons, the holding company of the group, and under Tata Sons' Articles of Association, the Trusts have the power to veto major board decisions. Article 121 lists several matters, including the appointment or removal of the chairman, sale of assets, and investments exceeding Rs 100 crore.The non-nominee directors led by Mistry had claimed that they were not being given complete updates on Tata Sons, restricting their ability to make informed decision. The nominee directors maintained they were bound by fiduciary duties to Tata Sons and could not share price-sensitive information about listed companies.Some key issues, including the public listing of Tata Sons, board appointments, and investments in certain group companies, may be revisited following the change in the Trusts' composition as a result of Mehli's exit. The RBI will have the final say on the IPO, as Tata Sons has sought an exemption by applying to surrender its core investment company registration.With Mistry's exit, new trustees are expected to be inducted with an eye on ensuring consensus; there's no clarity now on whether some existing tenures will be renewed. Mistry could still challenge the Trusts' decision in court, arguing that three trustees had violated the unanimous Oct 17 resolution stating that on expiry of tenure, a trustee's term would be renewed for life. But legal experts say the Trusts' deeds will take precedence in determining the legality of his removal.""The fact that there are two camps with diverse views can itself result in a vociferous feud, which the Tatas as a globally renowned institution can ill-afford,"" said senior corporate lawyer Swapnil Kothari. ""Absent a clause stipulating permanency, one cannot read a statutory right for permanent trusteeship in the entire framework of corporate laws. Amending the Trust deeds to incorporate permanency could be a Sisyphean task, particularly if the matter becomes sub judice. "" Kothari added that clarity in leadership and defined roles were critical to restoring functional smoothness and bridging what he called the current 'trust deficit.'""One can only hope wiser counsel prevails and issue is resolved amicably,"" he added.",Tensions had simmered within the Trusts with Mistry being seen by some trustees as slowing down decision-making. Divisions became evident in September after non-nominee directors led by Mistry blocked reappointment of Vijay Singh as a nominee director of Trusts on Tata Sons board.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124923111,imgsize-779342,width-400,resizemode-4/noel-tata.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and make landfall along the Andhra Pradesh coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam, near Kakinada, by Tuesday evening, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The name Montha meaning “beautiful” or “fragrant flower” was suggested by Thailand, one of the 13 member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UN ESCAP panel that governs cyclone naming in the North Indian Ocean region. Each name is used only once and never repeated.In the North Indian Ocean, which includes the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, cyclone naming is managed by the WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones. This panel includes 13 countries: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Yemen, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.Each member submits a list of names that reflect their culture, language, or natural environment. The names are then used sequentially whenever a new cyclone reaches the intensity required to be officially named by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which acts as the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for this region.Each country has submitted 13 names, forming a list of 169 names used sequentially and alphabetically. Names are neutral to gender, politics, and religion. The first cyclone of this season, Shakhti, suggested by Sri Lanka, formed earlier this month in the Arabian Sea but spared the Indian coast.The cyclone is likely to bring heavy rain across Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu with red alerts issued for several coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh.After Montha, the next cyclones will be named Senyar (UAE), Ditwah (Yemen), Arnab (Bangladesh), and Murasu (India). The naming system began in 2004, following a decision by the WMO and ESCAP in 2000, to make communication about tropical storms simpler and more effective for public awareness and disaster management.","Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by October 28.

Fiserv earnings miss triggers 44% stock plunge: Argentina slowdown deepens hit; leadership shake-up adds to market jitters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fiserv-earnings-miss-triggers-44-stock-plunge-argentina-slowdown-deepens-hit-leadership-shake-up-adds-to-market-jitters/articleshow/124911831.cms,"



Fintech major Fiserv Inc saw its shares crash 44% on Wednesday, heading for their worst day ever after the company cut its full-year earnings guidance and announced a sweeping leadership overhaul, CNBC reported.“Our current performance is not where we want it to be nor where our stakeholders expect it to be,” Fiserv CEO Mike Lyons said in a statement accompanying the results.The company now expects adjusted earnings of $8.50–8.60 per share for the year, sharply lower than its earlier forecast of $10.15–10.30. Revenue growth has also been trimmed to 3.5–4%, down from the previous estimate of 10%.Lyons told investors that Argentina’s worsening economic environment was a key drag on growth and margins. “Last year, Argentina contributed 10 percentage points to our 16% organic growth rate,” he said, adding that the company’s original forecast had assumed stronger growth from other markets to offset the slowdown.Fiserv’s adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.04, missing LSEG’s estimate of $2.64, while revenue rose 1% year-on-year to $4.92 billion, below the expected $5.36 billion. However, net income increased to $792 million from $564 million a year ago.Alongside the disappointing results, Fiserv unveiled major leadership changes. Starting December, COO Takis Georgakopoulos will become co-president alongside Dhivya Suryadevara, former CEO of Optum Financial Services. Paul Todd has been promoted to chief financial officer.“We also have opportunities in front of us to improve our results and execution, and I am confident that these are the right leaders to help guide Fiserv to long-term success,” Lyons said in a separate statement.Fiserv also said that Gordon Nixon, Céline Dufétel, and Gary Shedlin will join its board of directors in early 2026, with Nixon serving as independent chairman and Shedlin chairing the audit committee.The Milwaukee-based fintech has announced an action plan aimed at improving execution and driving “sustainable, high-quality growth.” The company will also move its stock listing from the NYSE to the Nasdaq next month, where it will trade under the ticker FISV, CNBC reported.","Fiserv Inc saw its shares crash 44% on Wednesday, heading for their worst day ever.

A wider shift in strategy





Paramount Skydance Corporation, the company behind the blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick, has announced plans to cut approximately 2,000 jobs as part of a sweeping restructuring. According to an internal memo sent by CEO David Ellison, the move is intended to streamline the organisation and ensure it remains a strong, future focused company. The first phase already saw around 1,000 US-based roles eliminated, with additional cuts expected soon.Ellison’s memo explains that after the August merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, redundancies emerged across the expanded enterprise. He wrote that in some areas roles are no longer aligned with the company’s evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen its focus on growth. The layoffs are part of a broader goal to achieve about US$2 billion in cost savings.The company plans to reduce around 2,000 jobs overall, which represents roughly 10 percent of its workforce. The first wave targeted approximately 1,000 positions and the cuts will affect a range of divisions including film, television, streaming and corporate functions, though the company has not released a detailed breakdown.Beyond job cuts, Paramount is undertaking several other strategic moves. The company has recently secured major content deals and continues to invest heavily in premium entertainment and franchises. These initiatives signal Ellison’s ambition to revitalise Paramount’s content slate and strengthen its competitive position across global media markets.Ellison’s memo states the company is committed to supporting impacted employees, with HR teams working closely with business unit leaders to provide information on severance, benefits and transition services. He acknowledged the heavy toll of such decisions and described them as never taken lightly.","Paramount Skydance Corporation, the company behind the blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick, has announced plans to cut approximately 2,000 jobs.

Earning blow: Boeing hit by $5.4-billion loss as 777X delays mount; $4.9-billion charge adds pressure on turnaround,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/earning-blow-boeing-hit-by-5-4-bn-loss-as-777x-delays-mount-4-9-bn-charge-adds-pressure-on-turnaround/articleshow/124906787.cms,"



Boeing reported a $5.4 billion loss for the third quarter on Wednesday as persistent certification delays for its 777X aircraft forced the company to book an additional $4.9 billion charge, according to an AFP report.The aviation major, however, posted a 30% year-on-year rise in revenue to $23.3 billion, driven by higher commercial jet deliveries. But the strong topline growth was overshadowed by the one-time hit on the long-delayed 777X programme, which continues to face an extended certification process with US aviation regulators.Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg pointed to the Federal Aviation Administration’s recent approval for a higher monthly production rate of the 737 MAX as a sign of progress. He also noted that Boeing generated positive free cash flow during the quarter — a metric closely tracked by Wall Street.Ortberg, however, acknowledged that the company still faces challenges in rebuilding its operations and reputation after multiple safety lapses, including the two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that brought stricter FAA scrutiny.Boeing has now pushed back the commercial launch of the 777X to 2027 from its earlier 2026 timeline.“While we are disappointed in the 777X schedule delay, the airplane continues to perform well in flight testing, and we remain focused on the work ahead to complete our development programs and stabilize our operations,” Ortberg said.In 2020, Boeing had booked a $6.5 billion charge on the same programme amid the protracted certification process and weak airline demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ortberg told CNBC there were no issues with the aircraft’s engine or airframe but admitted the company had “fallen behind” in obtaining FAA authorisations for flight testing.He added that while the ongoing US government shutdown could have a “minor” impact, it was not responsible for the current charge.Meanwhile, Boeing’s defence operations in St. Louis are “effectively executing” contingency plans after more than 3,000 workers rejected the company’s latest contract offer, Ortberg said in a message to employees. Local management has begun hiring replacement staff, while union leaders accused Boeing of refusing to negotiate in good faith.Shares of Boeing fell 4.1% in early trade following the announcement.",Boeing posted a 30% year-on-year rise in revenue to $23.3 billion.

Corporate earnings lift sentiment



Global markets upbeat







Wall Street stocks climbed to new highs on Wednesday, driven by Nvidia’s record-breaking surge past a $5 trillion market value and optimism ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s closely watched interest rate announcement. The rally gained momentum as investors anticipated further signs of policy easing from the central bank.The S&P 500 advanced 0.3% to 6,913.88, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5% to 47,964.20, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6% to 23,976.84 about 35 minutes into trading. All three benchmarks had closed at record highs on Tuesday.Nvidia, which had become the first company to cross the $4 trillion mark in July, extended its historic run after unveiling new ventures built on its artificial intelligence technology during a company event on Tuesday. The chipmaker’s stock jumped 4.9%, propelling its market value beyond $5 trillion — a first in corporate history.“The market is expecting nothing but good and better news from these companies, leaving virtually no room for disappointment,” said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O’Hare, referring to upcoming earnings from Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms later in the day.Hours later, the US Federal Reserve announced its second consecutive quarter-point interest rate cut of 2025, lowering its key lending rate to a range between 3.75% and 4.00%.The move was aimed at cushioning the economy against growing risks in the labour market.The decision, approved by a 10-2 vote, exposed divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee. Fed governor Stephen Miran voted for a larger half-point cut, while Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid preferred holding rates steady.“The press conference is going to be where the action happens,” said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management before the announcement. He noted that the government shutdown had disrupted key employment and economic data, complicating the central bank’s decision-making. “This is a Fed chair that will have to describe how the (Federal Reserve) gets to a decision on rates in the absence of government data, which is no easy task,” Hogan added.Bond yields remained largely stable, with the 10-year Treasury yield dipping to 3.98% from 3.99% late Tuesday, signalling investor caution ahead of the Fed’s statement. Traders are now watching for clues on whether policymakers will hint at another possible rate cut in December.Strong corporate earnings added to the market’s positive tone. Caterpillar shares surged 9.3% after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, bolstered by robust demand for construction and mining equipment. CEO Joe Creed said the firm saw “resilient demand” despite a “dynamic environment.”CVS Health rose 3.1% after exceeding profit estimates, even as it reported losses linked to a slowdown in its new primary care business. CEO David Joyner said the company had “stabilized operations.”Teradyne jumped 19% after reporting strong quarterly results, with CEO Greg Smith noting that “AI-related test demand remains robust.” Mondelez International fell 3.3% despite solid earnings, as the Oreo-maker warned of continued pressure from record cocoa prices.Asian stocks ended broadly higher, buoyed by Wall Street’s rally and diplomatic developments in the region. Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 2.2% to a new record, while South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.8% after US President Donald Trump met with Seoul’s leader during his visit to Japan. Shanghai’s Composite Index rose 0.7% ahead of Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade tensions.European markets traded mixed as investors tracked global central bank moves and major earnings reports, reflecting a cautious but optimistic outlook for the months ahead.","S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq all hit record highs on Wednesday.

Nvidia Corp has become the world’s first $5 trillion company, marking another milestone in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution reshaping global markets. The Silicon Valley chipmaker crossed the landmark just three months after breaching the $4 trillion mark, as its stock soared on the back of surging demand for AI chips and new strategic tie-ups, according to an AP report.Nvidia shares jumped 5.16% to $211.41 in early US trading on October 29 (9:36 am GMT-4), extending their blistering rally that has made the company the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. The stock has risen sharply since early 2023, fuelled by a global rush for AI computing power.The company’s $5.05 trillion market capitalisation now exceeds the combined GDP of Japan, the UK and India, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The milestone highlights the scale of investor confidence in Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure-- a technology wave widely seen as the most disruptive since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.However, global regulators have begun to warn of overheating in the sector. The Bank of England recently cautioned that soaring valuations of AI-linked tech stocks could create a market bubble, while IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has echoed similar concerns about the rapid pace of capital flows into the AI space.On Tuesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang disclosed chip orders worth $500 billion, signalling the company’s expanding reach in enterprise and government AI applications. Nvidia also unveiled a partnership with Uber to develop robotaxis and a $1 billion investment in Nokia to collaborate on 6G technology.In a major government collaboration, Nvidia is working with the US Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers, AP reported. The company has also committed $100 billion to OpenAI to establish new AI data centres with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity to enhance ChatGPT’s computing infrastructure.In August, Huang said Nvidia was in discussions with the Trump administration about designing a new computer chip for China. President Donald Trump later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping about Nvidia’s chip plans later this week.","N Nvidia shares jumped 5.16% to $211.41 in early US trading on October 29 (9:36 am GMT-4) The company’s $5.05 trillion market capitalisation now exceeds the combined GDP of Japan, the UK and India, according to the International Monetary Fund.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124904402,imgsize-380870,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Canada's upcoming federal budget (2025) will include creation of a ‘Foreign Credential Recognition Action Fund’, a $97 million initiative spread over five years.At present several immigrants with foreign degrees and professional licenses have to take up menial jobs, which include driving buses, while they wait endlessly for their credentials to be recognized.“The government will work with the provinces and territories to make credential recognition fairer, faster, and more transparent, helping qualified foreign-trained professionals contribute more quickly to Canada’s workforce, including in fields facing labour shortages such as health care and construction,” states a release issued by the Ministry of Finance and National Revenue. It adds that the funding will be sourced from existing departmental resources.The budget is to be tabled on Nov 4. The focus is on investments to boost the economy, empower workers, create high-paying careers, and protect and support those most affected by trade disruptions.However, with the announcement of a fund to recognize foreign credentials, immigration experts state that the role played by immigrants has not been disregarded. At present a ‘Foreign Credential Recognition Program’ exists, but the $ 97 million action fund is more focused on specific industries and is expected to reduce licensing wait times enabling thousands of immigrants to work in their specialized fields at the earliest.",Canada's upcoming federal budget (2025) will include creation of a ‘Foreign Credential Recognition Action Fund’ The $97 million initiative will be spread over five years.

Canadian PM Mark Carney on Sunday projected Canada as a reliable trading partner, as a part of his efforts to steer away trade from the US, which is becoming more protectionist and unpredictable.Speaking at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, which brings together 11 countries, Carney said as a consequence of President Donald Trump’s high protectionist tariffs, countries might end up trading with each other more and less with the US.During the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit, he also highlighted the scale of Canada’s natural resources and its efforts to speed up exports.“We’re an energy superpower – an unabashed energy superpower,” he told business leaders. “We have the third-largest reserves of oil. We have the fourth-largest reserves of LNG. We’ve just started our first LNG shipments,” as cited by The Globe and Mail.He urged Asian governments not to enter trade arrangements that restrict their options or limit their ability to work with other international partners.“What you should try to avoid doing, though, is tying your hands about what you can do with other jurisdictions, because there are a lot more countries, by GDP, that are willing and keen to continue to have relatively open trade, certainly to respect rules-based trade,” he said.Alongside oil and gas, Carney said Canada has begun the process of developing a revenue-generating small modular nuclear reactor. He added that Canada has one of the world’s largest reserves of critical minerals and is the “largest centre of mining finance in the world.”The leader also stressed that international partners will find strong demand in Canada’s own market. He said the government has committed to spending tens of billions more on the military, describing it as a “quadrupling of our defence spending” by the end of the decade. This includes investment in cybertechnology and artificial intelligence, according to the Globe and Mail.He also called for stronger links between existing trade blocs, saying the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership should be connected with the European Union. He described both pacts as having “complementary approaches to trade,” adding that he sees the possibility of “bringing those closer together, having, at a minimum, a docking between the two blocks or broader arrangements that are there, and that’s how you start to rebuild a broader global trading system. ”His remarks come as countries begin forming new alliances to maintain open trade. The Financial Times reported last week that several World Trade Organization members, including Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, are creating a new group called the Future of Investment and Trade Partnership, or “FIT-P,” to support trade openness.The partnership is expected to include around 10 countries, with New Zealand joining Singapore and the UAE as core founding members.

Taiwan’s Big Trade Gamble: Can An India Free Trade Pact Trigger China’s Next Geopolitical Clash?





China on Tuesday positioned itself as an option for open markets and regional cooperation, signing an upgraded free trade pact with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) while taking a veiled swipe at US President Donald Trump ’s protectionist stance.Premier Li Qiang said the new pact — the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area 3.0 — highlighted Beijing’s commitment to economic openness, in contrast to Washington’s tariff-heavy approach. “Pursuing confrontation instead of solidarity brings no benefit,” Li said at the ASEAN-China summit, invoking President Xi Jinping ’s earlier remark that “unity is strength"", as quoted by AP.The revised agreement expands the original 2002 pact implemented in 2010, covering a market of more than 2 billion people. It includes provisions for digital trade, green transition projects, and support for small and medium enterprises, aimed at deepening regional integration and supply chain resilience.Trade between China and Asean has surged from $235.5 billion in 2010 to nearly $1 trillion last year, making the bloc China’s largest trading partner. “We are good neighbours and good brothers, close in geography, culture and sentiment,” Li said, urging ASEAN states to “resist external interference and unreasonable tariffs.”But the emphasis on partnership met a cautious note from Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who said cooperation must be rooted in trust. “This cooperation cannot exist alongside coercion,” Marcos said, alluding to China’s assertive actions in the South China Sea.The agreement was signed in the presence of Li and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who chaired the summit. Anwar later stressed Asean’s “balanced approach” in engaging both the US and China, saying the bloc aimed to avoid taking sides amid escalating global trade rivalries.The deal was announced just as Trump unveiled new economic arrangements with several ASEAN countries, though existing tariffs on Chinese goods remain in place — a move analysts said highlighted Washington’s continued hard line.Political analyst Bridget Welsh said the pact “reflects a broader trend of non-US economies hedging by building stronger intra-regional ties,” especially in areas such as sustainability and technology.Marcos reiterated Manila’s concern over Chinese activities in disputed waters, including plans for a marine reserve, and pledged to advance Code of Conduct talks during the Philippines’ upcoming ASEAN chairmanship.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun accused the Philippines of “provocative actions,” while regional observers urged separating territorial issues from economic cooperation.","China on Tuesday positioned itself as an option for open markets and regional cooperation.

prediction markets





Truth Social users will soon be able to explore beyond posts and political commentary, by making bets on the possibility of events like election results and economic prediction.US President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social is expanding with the introduction of real-world event betting directly on the app.Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) on Tuesday announced that users would be able to place wagers on outcomes across politics, economics, sports and entertainment. The move is being rolled out through a partnership with Crypto.com, and will let users bet on “elections, interest rates and inflation rate changes, commodity prices on gold and crude oil,” or on events from “all major sports leagues.”“Prediction markets,” unlike casino-style betting, do not fall under the gambling category, according to federal authorities. Users need to buy a “contract,” essentially a financial position that pays out if the user’s forecast is correct. For instance, predicting the election results for a candidate or choosing the team expected to win a match.They are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), rather than state gambling regulators that oversee casinos and lotteries.Prediction markets have soared in popularity, particularly on mobile apps, and are attracting major financial interest. Earlier this month, Intercontinental Exchange, the company that operates the New York Stock Exchange, committed $2 billion to Polymarket, one of the most prominent platforms in the space.The surge has also sparked warnings, as these apps have become especially popular among young adults, raising concerns about addiction and the potential for users to incur significant financial losses.For TMTG, the move into betting comes as the company continues to search for stronger revenue streams. It has experimented with cryptocurrency-linked financial products and launched a video streaming platform.Despite these efforts, the company generated only $1.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2025, while posting a net loss of $51.7 million, according to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.","Truth Social users will be able to place wagers on outcomes across politics, economics, sports and entertainment.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

IndiGo cancellations: On-time performance crashes to 8.5%! Chaos unfolds at airports with over 400 flights cancelled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-cancellations-on-time-performance-crashes-to-8-5-chaos-unfolds-at-airports-with-over-400-flights-cancelled/articleshow/125783423.cms,"Massive Outrage Over IndiGo Chaos, Over 600 Flights Cancelled In India's Biggest Aviation Crisis

IndiGo’s operational crisis deepened on Friday as its on-time performance at six major metro airports collapsed to just 8.5%, according to data published on the Civil Aviation Ministry website. The sharp fall became the latest flashpoint in a continuing disruption that has now stretched into its fourth straight day.The airline cancelled all departing flights from Chennai airport until 6pm, according to sources cited by PTI. Alongside, it also suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight, adding to the turmoil for passengers already facing widespread delays and cancellations across the country.This comes barely 24 hours after IndiGo scrapped more than 550 domestic and international flights, far above its usual levels of disruption. Airports remain overwhelmed as passengers report being stranded for days without proper assistance. Scenes of frustration have been visible across terminals, with travellers complaining of no food, no water, vacant counters and missing luggage. Some flights were delayed by more than 12 hours, adding to the congestion at airports such as Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Goa.According to PTI, Friday’s cancellations alone crossed 400. The city-wise breakdown included 118 cancellations in Mumbai, 100 in Bengaluru, 75 in Hyderabad, 35 in Kolkata, 26 in Chennai and 11 in Goa, with several other airports also reporting disruptions. Queues have grown longer by the hour as flyers struggle to rebook tickets or retrieve their baggage, while many complain of having no clarity on when they will be able to travel.With IndiGo accounting for roughly 65% of India’s domestic market, the impact has begun spilling over to other carriers.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has now stepped in, requiring IndiGo to submit a detailed roadmap covering pilot hiring, training timelines, roster restructuring and safety assessments. The regulator has also made it mandatory for the airline to file a progress report every 15 days. IndiGo has assured the DGCA that “normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026.”IndiGo currently operates more than 400 aircraft, runs over 2,300 flights daily, connects over 90 domestic and 45 international destinations, and flew 118 million passengers in FY25. The airline was recently named “Best Airline in India and South Asia” at the 2025 Skytrax Awards.Data submitted to the regulator shows that IndiGo has 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers available for December. However, its crew requirement has risen sharply since the second phase of the Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) rules came into effect. In November alone, it required 2,422 captains and 2,153 first officers, higher than the October requirement of 2,186 captains and 1,948 first officers. With the updated FDTL norms also limiting the number of night landings per pilot, night operations have faced the hardest hit.On the top of that, the airline also increased its domestic flight count by 6%, from 14,158 in the summer schedule to 15,014 in the winter schedule beginning 26 October. The mismatch between flight capacity and available pilots has resulted in the current crunch, leaving passengers to deal with both mass cancellations and soaring fares.",IndiGo's on-time performance at six major metro airports collapsed to just 8.5%. The airline cancelled all departing flights from Chennai airport until 6pm. It also suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are exhibiting weakness, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities. Here recommends a sell on rise strategy for investors:Gold futures on MCX traded near ₹1,30,000, showing signs of weakness after failing to sustain above the immediate resistance zone. Price action suggests that momentum is tilting in favor of sellers as the short-term averages flatten and oscillators indicate a lack of bullish conviction. The technical setup supports a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,30,400, with a stop-loss at ₹1,31,500 and potential downside targets around ₹1,29,000.Moving Averages (EMA 8 & EMA 21): The 8 EMA has flattened and is trending close to the 21 EMA, signaling loss of momentum and indecision in the short term. A failure to reclaim the ₹1,30,750–₹1,31,000 region will likely keep the bias negative for the session.Gold prices have slipped below the mid-bollinger band, confirming a shift to mild bearishness. The lower Bollinger band near ₹1,29,200 could act as the next support if selling pressure intensifies.•⁠ ⁠Resistance Levels: ₹1,30,750 – ₹1,31,130 – ₹1,31,500•⁠ ⁠Support Levels: ₹1,29,800 – ₹1,29,300 – ₹1,29,000Repeated rejection near the upper pivots suggests a short-term top formation, strengthening the case for a downside move.The RSI is currently at 50.3, showing neutral momentum but with no signs of strength, implying limited upside potential and scope for corrective pressure.The MACD remains below the signal line, reflecting continued bearish sentiment. The histogram shows weak buying pressure, indicating that any bounce may remain short-lived.•⁠ ⁠Strategy: Sell on rise•⁠ ⁠Entry Zone: ₹1,30,400 – ₹1,30,450•⁠ ⁠Stop-Loss: ₹1,31,500•⁠ ⁠Targets: ₹1,29,300 and ₹1,29,000•⁠ ⁠Bias: Bearish below ₹1,30,750; sustained trade below ₹1,29,800 could accelerate downside momentum.Gold’s intraday structure remains weak with flattening EMAs, a neutral RSI, and a bearish MACD crossover. The repeated rejection near upper resistance reinforces a short-term bearish bias. Traders are advised to adopt a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,30,400, keeping a strict stop-loss at ₹1,31,500 and targeting ₹1,29,000. Sustained weakness below ₹1,29,800 could open further downside potential toward ₹1,28,800.","Gold prices are exhibiting weakness, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

It’s just based on cross-country comparison of India having this much volatility compared to some other countries.” She said India remains firmly in the managed float category like most emerging markets.",RBI deputy governor Poonam Gupta responds to recent IMF comments.

MUMBAI: A pro-growth monetary policy statement from RBI lifted investor sentiment on Dalal Street on Friday that lifted the sensex by nearly 450 points to close at 85,712 points. The rate cut decision, which is expected to aid banks’ lending business, led to a strong rally in banking stocks with SBI and HDFC Bank contributing the most to the day's gain in sensex. Nifty closed 153 points up at 26,186 points.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments, the domestic market responded enthusiastically to RBI's unexpected 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) rate cut decision, a move that seemed unlikely given the strong Q2 GDP data.“This surprise (rate cut), combined with sharply lower inflation forecasts and supportive liquidity measures, triggered a risk-on sentiment across equities,” he said. Rate-sensitive sectors such as autos, real estate, and NBFCs led the day’s gains as lower rates would result in reduction in their costs, Nair said.The banking index on BSE, bankex, was up by a modest 0.9% with nine of its constituents closing higher, and only one — Yes Bank — closing in the red. Markets are expected to consolidate with a positive bias, supported by RBI’s rate and liquidity actions, steady domestic flows and rising expectations of a Fed rate cut, Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.","The rate cut decision led to a strong rally in banking stocks with SBI and HDFC Bank contributing the most to the day's gain in sensex.

‘Will meet productive needs of eco’

MUMBAI: The RBI delivered its first rate cut since June 2025 on Friday, lowering the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%. The move is expected to soften home loan rates, which may fall to a record low.The RBI also raised the growth projection for FY26 to 7.3% from 6.8% while lowering the inflation estimate sharply and said the economy had remained resilient amid global challenges.Monetary Policy Committee retained a neutral stance but backed the rate cut with a big liquidity boost: nearly ₹1.45 lakh crore will be injected into the bond market through ₹1 lakh crore of bond repurchases and a 3-year dollar–rupee swap worth $5 billion.The repo rate cut is expected to impact credit markets quickly. Home loan rates are set to fall to levels last briefly seen during the pandemic. Several state-owned banks currently price home loans at 7.35%; these will decline to roughly 7.1%.For new borrowers to secure rates at 7.1%, banks would have to trim deposit rates sharply or widen spreads, raising the risk that recent borrowers on floating rates end up better off than incoming customers.RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said, “Despite an unfavourable and challenging external environment, the Indian economy has shown remarkable resilience and is poised to register high growth.”“The headroom provided by the inflation outlook has allowed us to remain growth supportive. We will continue to meet the productive requirements of the economy in a proactive manner while ensuring macroeconomic stability,” said Malhotra Now, the RBI estimates third quarter GDP growth at 7% and 6.5% for the fourth. Growth for the next fiscal year is forecast at 6.7%. The economy expanded 8.2% in the second quarter of the current fiscal year after a 7.8% expansion in the Apr-June quarter.Malhotra credited GST cuts and improved monsoon prospects for supporting demand, noting that domestic activity has stayed resilient despite global trade frictions.Retail inflation projections for 2025-26 has been cut sharply to 2% from 2.6%, with food price moderation playing a key role. The RBI noted that inflationary pressures appear even softer once the outsized contribution of precious metals in recent readings is stripped out.The latest rate cut arrives at a moment when the rupee has weakened to around 89.84–90 per dollar, but a reserve stockpile of $686 billion—more than 11 months of import cover—has allowed policymakers room to manoeuvre.Malhotra said the external sector remains steady despite FII withdrawals and weakness in merchandise exports. Robust services exports and remittances have helped. Central banks in the US and Europe have paused their own tightening cycles, raising expectations of easing elsewhere in 2026, but domestic data gave the RBI a stronger impetus.GDP expanded 8.2% in the July-Sept quarter of the current fiscal year on the back of investment and services, while Oct CPI inflation of 0.25% was the lowest in decades.Lenders face an uncomfortable trade-off. Lower lending rates will compress margins unless funding costs fall. NBFCs are expected to benefit sooner because of faster passthrough to their borrowing costs. Umesh Revankar of Shriram Finance called the policy “a significant enabler,” arguing that the neutral stance and large-scale open-market purchases will quicken transmission to sectors dependent on last-mile finance, including truck operators, rural entrepreneurs and MSMEs.Banks are already pursuing higher-yield credit to offset margin strain. With large companies funding themselves through equity and bond markets, lenders are gravitating toward MSME and retail customers, which have been driving credit growth for several quarters. Yet the appetite for risk has limits. Recent data on credit deployment shows banks tilting toward secured assets such as gold and auto loans, while reining in unsecured personal lending.","RBI delivered its first rate cut since June 2025 on Friday.

"Simone Tata, who made Lakme a household name in India, dies at 95",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/simone-tata-who-made-lakme-a-household-name-in-india-dies-at-95/articleshow/125798594.cms,"Trent-setter Simone was force behind Westside

MUMBAI: Simone Tata (nee Dunoyer), a Swiss national who married into the Tatas and built India’s most enduring cosmetics brand, passed away in Mumbai Friday at 95.Lakme, a Tata venture born of an unusual request by then PM Nehru, who noticed that Indian women relied heavily on imported cosmetics, draining precious foreign exchange, was named after the French opera Lakme, (itself referencing Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess). Simone became its driving force, marketing it in a way that directly questioned the taboo around makeup.Simone, who grew up in Geneva, had recalled growing up absorbing lessons on presenting oneself with care. Talking to Vogue in 2017, she recalled her first brush with the transformative power of cosmetics before a piano recital. A self-described tomboy, she was surprised when her mother dusted her face with cream, blush, and powder. “I was transformed,” she said. That moment sparked a lifelong fascination with beauty.Simone, who grew up in Geneva, Switzerland, had recalled absorbing lessons on presenting oneself with care. Beauty and grooming were woven into daily life. In a 2017 interview with Vogue, she spoke about her first brush with the transformative power of cosmetics before a piano recital.A self-described tomboy, she was surprised when her mother dusted her face with cream, blush, and powder. “I was transformed,” she had said. That moment sparked a lifelong fascination with beauty.Simone’s life changed course when she met Tata Group stalwart Naval Tata in Geneva. At the time, she worked for Air India — then under the Tata umbrella — and Naval often visited the city as a board member of the International Labour Organization. In 1953, at age 23, she visited India for the first time during a summer holiday. Despite a 26-year age difference and Naval’s previous marriage to Soonoo Commisariat, their bond deepened. The two married in 1955, and though Simone retained her Swiss passport, she embraced Mumbai as her home.Becoming part of the Tata family also meant being stepmother to Naval’s sons, Jimmy and Ratan, the latter of whom would go on to become one of India’s most admired business leaders. In Horizons, a publication by Tata Trusts, she remembered Ratan returning home during a school break from the US wearing a Frank Sinatra–style straw hat — “a gangly Parsee youth disguised as an American star”. A year into her marriage, Simone and Naval welcomed their son, Noel, now chairman of Tata Trusts.Her entry into business came in 1961, influenced partly by her husband’s interests but more so by her own growing professional curiosity. She joined Lakme and began marketing it in a way that resonated with modern Indian women.Advertiser and screenwriter Kamlesh Pandey once recounted a turning point in the brand’s journey. His agency, Rediffusion, had proposed a stark black-and-white campaign that questioned the social taboo around makeup with the line: “Is it bad to look good?” Simone initially detested the concept — accustomed as she was to colourful, glamorous visuals. “But our account supervisor Vishwanathan went on selling it. She could not take it anymore and exploded,’ Mr Vishwanathan, I do not like to see your face!’ ‘It doesn’t matter if you do not like to see my face, Mrs Tata,’ countered Vishwanathan fearlessly, “But this is the campaign you are going to buy!” And she bought the campaign, which went on to win several awards…,” wrote Pandey for exchange4media in Sept. It was one of many decisions that showed Simone’s willingness to adapt, experiment, and trust disruptive ideas.In 1996, Tata Group sold Lakme to HUL as part of a restructuring effort. Simone channelled the sale proceeds to acquire British retail chain Littlewoods, laying the foundation for the group’s entry into fashion retail. Littlewoods was soon rebranded as Westside, which is now one of India’s most successful department store formats. Over the decades, Simone oversaw the group’s consumer businesses including Lakme and Trent (which operates Westside) — and served on the boards of Tata Industries and the Sir Ratan Tata Institute. She eventually retired in 2006. “She was a gracious lady and an outstanding entrepreneur,” said former Tata Group director Ishaat Hussain.After retirement, Simone remained out of the public eye. She appeared occasionally — at the reopening of the renovated Westside flagship in 2019; at the funeral of her son’s brother-in-law and former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry in 2022; and at Ratan’s funeral in 2024. Simone passed away at Mumbai’s Breach Candy Hospital. A funeral mass will be held on Saturday at the Cathedral of the Holy Name in Colaba, a church Simone regularly attended.","Simone Tata, a Swiss national who married into the Tatas and built India’s most enduring cosmetics brand, passed away in Mumbai Friday at 95.

Noel now largest Tata family stakeholder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/noel-now-largest-tata-family-stakeholder/articleshow/125798553.cms,"Noel tata, Ratan Tata, Simone Tata

MUMBAI: Former Tata Group director Simone Tata had transferred ownership of her assets, including Tata Sons shares, to her son and Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, said people in the know.The move, which took place some years ago, increased Noel’s stake in Tata Sons to 1%, making him the largest Tata family shareholder in the holding company of the $180-billion Tata Group. He holds 4,058 Tata Sons shares, up from 2,055 shares.Noel’s late half-brother, Ratan Tata, had held 3,368 Tata Sons shares, equivalent to a 0.83% stake, which he bequeathed to his foundations, Ratan Tata Endowment Foundation and Ratan Tata Endowment Trust (RTET), in a 70:30 ratio. Noel, who serves as a director of Tata Sons, is also a trustee of RTET. Another half-brother, Jimmy Tata, owns 3,262 Tata Sons shares, representing a 0.81% stake.Other members of the extended Tata family including Piloo Tata, wife of late Minocher Tata (a grandnephew of Tata Group founder Jamsetji Tata), and their children Jimmy Tata (chief credit officer at HDFC Bank ) and Vera Choksey, collectively hold 801 shares in Tata Sons.The shares held by Simone, Noel, Ratan, and Jimmy were inherited from Naval Tata. Ratan and Jimmy were his children from his first marriage to Soonoo Commisariat, while Noel was his third son from his second marriage to Simone.Ratan’s stake had increased slightly over time as he purchased shares from retiring company directors, including Freddie Mehta, Homi Sethna, and Darbari Seth, said the people.Of the 2,011 Tata Sons shares originally held by Simone, she transferred 2,003 shares to Noel. It remains unclear whether the remaining eight shares are still under her name or have been gifted to Noel’s three children.A tax expert noted, “Gifts to blood relatives either during the donor’s lifetime or through a will are exempt from capital gains tax.”In addition to Tata Sons shares, Simone’s estates in Geneva and Mumbai had also been gifted to Noel and his family. She had purchased a 3,000sqft apartment in Bakhtawar — opposite the Portuguese Church in Colaba, Mumbai — after the Tata family sold their Fort residence, Tata House, to Deutsche Bank in 1992. Noel also owns an apartment in the same building, the people said.","Former Tata Group director Simone Tata had transferred ownership of her assets, including Tata Sons shares, to her son and Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata.

HealthEdge deal marks Frank D’Souza’s redux,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/healthedge-deal-marks-frank-dsouzas-redux/articleshow/125798631.cms,"BENGALURU: It’s something of a Francisco D’Souza redux. After stepping down as Cognizant CEO, D’Souza co-founded Recognize. Now, Bain Capital, in partnership with Recognize, has closed a multi-billion-dollar deal to acquire HealthEdge, the US-based healthcare software provider.During D’Souza’s tenure, Cognizant carved out a strong franchise in healthcare, with the former CEO playing a pivotal role in the $2.7 billion all-cash acquisition of TriZetto in 2014 — a landmark deal that anchored Cognizant’s healthtech ambitions. TriZetto’s platform connects with 11,000 payers and processes more than 4 billion transactions a year.Early in its growth journey, Cognizant rapidly expanded its healthcare presence, counting nine of the top 10 payers — including United, Anthem, Cigna, and Aetna — as customers, along with nearly 30 major pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, and Eli Lilly.Interestingly, this now puts HealthEdge in direct competition with TriZetto — a déjà vu moment for D’Souza, who is building a strong healthcare portfolio through Recognize. D’Souza’s tech investment firm, Recognize, raised $1.7 billion for its second fund — just three years after closing its $1.3 billion debut. The fund identifies companies valued between $50 million and $500 million, leveraging Recognize’s partnership-driven model to accelerate growth and create long-term value.In fact, Recognize was brought in as a preferred partner for HealthEdge, given its deep vertical expertise in digital services. Recognize’s thesis echoes the same strategic instincts. On its website, the firm notes that it is investing behind the belief that powerful industry tailwinds will accelerate the shift toward next-generation payer claims software, especially as legacy platforms remain under-invested and healthcare payers face rising workflow and data complexity.When TOI reached out to D’Souza on how he sees the development playing out, he said, “Recognize is delighted to partner with Bain Capital and the HealthEdge management team on this transaction that we believe epitomises the ‘services as software’ shift that AI is driving in the digital services industry. HealthEdge stands at the forefront of that shift in healthcare. By blending advanced technology with deep operational understanding, it offers payers an integrated digital core built for an AI-driven world. That is why this partnership is both timely and transformative.”In April, the Financial Times reported that Bain Capital struck a deal to buy HealthEdge in a transaction valuing the business at about $2.6 billion, including debt. Some news reports peg HealthEdge’s revenue at over $400 million. HealthEdge already has one of the sector’s widest footprints, with 130 health plan customers, 110 million covered lives, and operations across 48 states.In Sept, UST sold HealthProof to Bain for $1.3 billion. As part of the deal, UST HealthProof will be merged with HealthEdge, creating one of the healthcare industry’s next-generation platforms for payers. HealthEdge and UST HealthProof will operate under the HealthEdge banner, in a move that appears aimed at combining complementary healthcare assets to unlock greater value. From TriZetto to HealthEdge, D’Souza appears to be returning to his healthcare playbook.","Bain Capital has closed a multi-billion-dollar deal to acquire HealthEdge. D’Souza’s tech investment firm, Recognize, raised $1.7 billion for its second fund. The former Cognizant CEO is building a strong healthcare portfolio through Recognize.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125798647,imgsize-33524,width-400,resizemode-4/cognizant.jpg"

IndiGo disruptions: Civil aviation minister pins chaos on crew mismanagement; vows to ensure accountability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-disruptions-civil-aviation-minister-pins-chaos-on-crew-mismanagement-vows-to-ensure-accountability/articleshow/125793332.cms,"File photo: Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu

Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu on Friday held IndiGo responsible for the recent chaos at major airports across India, attributing the disruptions to the airline’s mismanagement of crew under the new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).The minister said the government had granted the airline certain abeyance from FDTL rules to bring operations back to normal.“From November 1, the DGCA came up with new FDTL regulations. The ministry also engaged continuously with airlines for at least six months. Other carriers, including Air India and SpiceJet, have adjusted. What has unfolded is due to mismanagement by IndiGo regarding its crew,” Naidu said, as quoted by ANI.He added that a committee has been formed to probe the disruptions and ensure accountability, noting, “Whoever is responsible for the present situation needs to pay for it.”Naidu stressed that the immediate priority is restoring normalcy and supporting passengers.“Five lakh people travel by air every day. We are closely monitoring this and the FDTL norms and scheduling the network. We will thoroughly investigate this and ensure that all airlines exercise due diligence.We can’t compromise on safety,” he said.The minister explained that IndiGo was initially instructed to resolve delays within two days.“However, we saw delays happening yesterday as well. Therefore, we told IndiGo to cancel major operations so that the inconvenience at the airport and the congestion due to delays are reduced,” he said.Special attention has been directed toward senior citizens and differently-abled passengers, ensuring food, water, accommodation, and smooth communication at airports.IndiGo, which controls nearly 70% of India’s domestic traffic, has been granted a one-time exemption from the DGCA’s pilot night duty rules until February 10, 2026.This allows the airline to bypass stricter flight duty and rest period norms, specifically for night duty between 0000 and 0650 hours.The DGCA has also withdrawn the rule restricting substitution of pilot leave for weekly rest. These measures aim to stabilise operations amid the airline’s crew shortage, though the Airlines’ Pilots Association (ALPA) India has criticised the move, arguing it undermines safety regulations.The disruptions, which began on December 3, have led IndiGo to cancel over 1,000 flights in recent days, affecting thousands of passengers, as per PTI.The civil aviation ministry anticipates that complete restoration of services will be achieved within the next three days, with normal operations resuming progressively from Saturday.",Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu held IndiGo responsible for the recent chaos at major airports across India.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that prices rose 0.3% in September from August, matching the previous month’s increase, in a report delayed five weeks by the government shutdown.Core prices — excluding food and energy — rose 0.2%, also the same as August. On an annual basis, overall prices increased 2.8%, slightly above 2.7% in August, while core inflation eased marginally to 2.8% from 2.9%, According to AP report.Economists said the data point to muted core inflation and bolster the case for a rate cut, even though headline inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target. They noted that President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to put upward pressure on prices, though Fed officials argue that slow hiring, modest economic growth and subdued wage gains are likely to cool inflation in coming months.Omair Sharif, chief economist at Inflation Insights, said Friday’s report would likely reassure policymakers that core inflation remains contained.But he flagged one area of concern: a measure of services inflation that remains stubbornly high.“It hasn’t really shown any sign of slowing down,” Sharif said. “That has to be concerning for them.”The Fed faces a difficult policy choice next week. Under typical conditions, it would keep rates elevated to curb inflation. But with hiring weakening and unemployment slowly rising, it hopes that cutting rates will spur borrowing and support the economy.Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose 0.3% in September, down from 0.5% in August, signalling softer household demand. Spending appeared to strengthen over Black Friday and the following weekend; Adobe Analytics reported a 7.7% rise in online spending during the five-day holiday period.Household incomes increased 0.4% in September, the second consecutive month of solid growth.The broader economy continues to send mixed signals.

The housing market is stagnant and factories have been cutting jobs, yet heavy investment in artificial intelligence data centres has provided support.On Wednesday, payroll processor ADP said businesses shed 32,000 jobs in November, an indication that job markets may be weakening further.

"Trust fund babies – but there's a twist! What are ‘Trump Accounts’? Here's how to claim your $1,000",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trust-fund-babies-but-theres-a-twist-what-are-trump-accounts-heres-how-to-claim-your-1000/articleshow/125778800.cms,"So, what exactly is the Trump Account?



Who qualifies for the $1,000?



They must be US citizens and have a Social Security number. The programme is limited only to the babies born during Trump administration, i.e., born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028. A parent can open the account regardless of their own immigration status.

Nothing for older children?



Enrolling for Trump Accounts



Why supporters say the programme matters



Concerns from critics



The journey into adulthood has looked different for everyone, depending on the family they are born into. In affluent homes, young people often leave with a trust fund to soften the landing, while for the less privileged, turning 18 can mean stepping into financial responsibility almost overnight. This, however, might change with the less famous provision of US President Donald Trump's tax legislation, which aims to give $1,000 to every new born.Say hello to the Trump Account that promises to help narrow that divide by ensuring every child enters adulthood with something to build on.Inside this provision, every newborn gets $1,000, provided their parents open an investment account under the new programme. The bill, which became law earlier this year, allows private firms to invest the funds in the stock market, and the child gains access only when they turn 18. Parents of older children can also participate by opening an account, although those children won’t receive the $1,000 incentive.However, a significant boost arrived earlier this week when philanthropists Michael and Susan Dell pledged funding that will allow some children aged 10 and below to receive $250 if their parents open an account.The Dell donation applies to children living in ZIP codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less, and who would not otherwise qualify for the Treasury-funded $1,000.A Trump Account functions as a long-term savings vehicle tied directly to the stock market. Money is held until the child turns 18 and can only be used for specific milestones, including paying for higher education, starting a business or making a down payment on a house.When an account is created for an eligible newborn, the US Treasury contributes $1,000. Private banks and brokerages manage the investments, and the rules require that funds be placed in US equity index funds with annual fees capped at 0.10%.Parents may also add up to the funds, contributing up to $2,500 per year in pretax income, much like a retirement account. Employers, friends, relatives, local governments and charitable groups can also contribute. There is a $5,000 yearly contribution cap, not considering government and charitable donations.The $1,000 seed deposit is available to babies who tick all these boxes:Though children born before 2025 will not receive the $1,000 Treasury incentive, an account can still be opened for any child younger than 18.These accounts allow up to $2,500 per year in pretax contributions from parents. Some may also qualify for the Dells’ $250 donation if they are aged 10 or under and live in eligible ZIP codes.While contributions cannot be made until July 2026, families can begin the enrolment process by submitting Form 4547 to the Internal Revenue Service.Parents who sign up early will receive instructions in May to complete the setup process. The White House says an online portal for account registration will go live in July.Another thing to keep in mind is that the money cannot be used before the child turns 18 except in exceptional cases, and withdrawals will be taxed, meaning the programme is not designed to assist with immediate household needs.Those backing the idea argue that the initiative expands access to stock market investing and offers even children born into poverty the opportunity to gain from long-term financial growth. They say that providing every newborn with $1,000 could counter the rising appeal of socialism by giving more Americans a direct path to wealth creation. The US Securities and Exchange Commission reports that 58% of American households owned stocks or bonds in 2022, but the richest 1% held almost half of the total value.Before Trump Accounts, there were ""baby bonds,"" introduced by states like California, Connecticut and the district of Columbia, that targeted children raised in poverty, foster care or those who lost a parent to COVID-19. Several other states, including Maryland, are weighing similar schemes.However, unlike Trump Accounts, those state-led programmes exclude wealthier children and are funded and managed by governments instead of private investment firms.Opponents argue that the programme offers no support to children during their early years, the stage when families are most financially vulnerable. They also note that the accounts do not compensate for cuts made elsewhere. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans reduced funding for programmes including Medicaid and food assistance in the same tax bill that introduced the accounts.They further warned that the policy could deepen economic inequality. Families capable of making the maximum yearly pretax contribution will see the greatest financial gains, whereas those unable to save will benefit the least. Using a projected annual return of 7%, the $1,000 Treasury contribution would grow to roughly $3,570 by the time a child reaches 18.","The Trump Account is a provision of US President Donald Trump's tax legislation.

The end of “streaming versus Hollywood”





Why this is a hinge moment for entertainment

Netflix was born out of the resentments of the video cassette age. Anyone who lived through the 1990s remembers the ritual: rushing to the local rental store on a Friday evening, discovering the last VHS copy was already gone and then returning the tape late on Monday morning, only to be punished with a fee that cost more than the film. Netflix emerged as a small Californian rebellion against this experience. Instead of fluorescent aisles and impatient clerks, it offered DVDs in red envelopes mailed directly to your home. Instead of rewinding tapes, you simply logged into a website and waited for the postman to arrive. It was a simple idea designed for people who wanted to escape the tyranny of Blockbuster.Two and a half decades later, that humble mail-order start-up is preparing to buy the studio that helped build modern Hollywood itself. Netflix’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros – the century-old home of Casablanca, Harry Potter, DC superheroes, The Lord of the Rings (via New Line), HBO and control of classics like The Wizard of Oz – for an enterprise value of roughly 82.7 billion dollars marks a transformative moment in entertainment history. For the first time, a company that began its life shipping DVDs is about to take ownership of a film and television library that has shaped global culture for a hundred years.This is not just a corporate transaction. It is the moment streaming becomes the centre of the entertainment universe.Netflix’s early success came from identifying a simple human truth: people hated late fees. The company replaced penalties with subscriptions and replaced return dates with unlimited rentals. But the real leap arrived in 2007, when Netflix began streaming films directly over the internet. At the time, internet video was grainy, unreliable and better suited for cat clips than cinema. Yet Netflix bet that broadband infrastructure would catch up.That bet proved correct. Streaming transformed Netflix from a quirky DVD service into the largest entertainment platform on the planet. The company expanded around the world, built an unmatched recommendation system and eventually began producing its own shows. House of Cards and Orange Is the New New Black showed that Netflix could make premium television. Stranger Things, Money Heist, Squid Game and Bridgerton made it a cultural force.Yet Netflix still faced one structural weakness. It had hits, but it did not have heritage. Unlike Disney or Warner Bros, it did not own a deep catalogue of films and shows that could be reimagined for generations, sold across formats or spun into franchises. Its library was powerful but relatively young. For a subscription business, long-lasting intellectual property becomes the anchor that holds audiences in place.If Netflix represents the story of technological disruption, Warner Bros represents the foundation of Hollywood itself. Founded in 1923, the studio introduced sound to cinema with The Jazz Singer. It gave the world Casablanca, defined the golden age of musicals with titles it now controls such as The Wizard of Oz, shaped modern rebellion with Rebel Without a Cause, reinvented horror with The Exorcist and expanded the boundaries of action cinema with The Matrix. Its New Line division shepherded The Lord of the Rings trilogy to global acclaim.Its television arm is equally influential. HBO transformed scripted entertainment by proving that cinematic storytelling could thrive on the small screen. The Sopranos, The Wire, Game of Thrones and Succession reshaped what television could be. Meanwhile, Warner’s mainstream sitcoms – Friends, The Big Bang Theory, ER and dozens more – became the comfort food of global syndication.But Warner Bros also endured repeated mergers, debt burdens and strategic upheavals. As cable television declined, the economics that once funded HBO came under strain. HBO Max, though expanding into new regions and still growing, lagged Netflix in global scale. The company found itself navigating the impossible balance between legacy networks, theatrical releases and streaming ambitions.This is the legacy Netflix is buying.But Netflix’s expansion is not being greeted with universal enthusiasm. A group of prominent filmmakers has already sent an anonymous letter to members of the US Congress warning that the acquisition could “hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace,” arguing that a Netflix-controlled Warner Bros would have the power to shrink theatrical release windows and destabilise the ecosystem that sustains thousands of industry jobs. Their note, referenced in the Variety report, describes fears that Netflix’s dominance as both a buyer and distributor could give it unprecedented leverage over exhibition chains, post-theatrical licensing and the financial health of feature filmmaking itself. The appeal urges lawmakers to subject the deal to the highest level of antitrust scrutiny, framing the merger not merely as a business story but a cultural and institutional inflection point for Hollywood.The financials make clear how monumental this transaction is. Netflix will acquire the Warner Bros studio, HBO, HBO Max and the entire film and television catalogue for an enterprise value of roughly 82.7 billion dollars and equity value of around 72 billion dollars. Shareholders will receive a mix of cash and Netflix stock valued at about 27.75 dollars per share. Netflix expects annual cost savings of two to three billion dollars by year three and forecasts that the deal will increase earnings per share by year two.Before the acquisition closes, Warner Bros Discovery will spin off its linear networks – CNN, Discovery, TLC and various factual and lifestyle channels – into a separate company. Netflix is purchasing the creative and streaming heart of the Warner empire, not the legacy cable infrastructure.This deal rivals Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox in scale and easily surpasses most modern entertainment mergers. Yet the dynamic is entirely different: a digital-born platform is absorbing a traditional studio, not the other way around.The acquisition solves three long-standing problems for Netflix in one move.The first is the library gap. By acquiring Warner’s vault, Netflix finally gains a catalogue with true generational weight. DC superheroes, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, The Matrix, Looney Tunes, HBO’s golden-age dramas and thousands of films and TV episodes become permanent Netflix assets. These are not simply shows and movies; they are narrative worlds that can be extended, rebooted and monetised for decades.The second change is theatrical power. Warner Bros owns soundstages, production facilities and distribution relationships that span the globe. Netflix’s relationship with cinemas has always been experimental and occasionally uneasy. By inheriting Warner’s infrastructure and release commitments, Netflix gains the credibility and machinery of a long-standing theatrical studio. It no longer needs to choose between being a streaming platform or a film studio. It becomes both.The third transformation concerns control. Netflix no longer depends on external studios for high-value franchises. It controls windows, renewals, merchandising and long-term franchise strategy. It can blend its vast viewer data with Warner’s storytelling and production expertise to decide which universes to expand and how to release them.In effect, Netflix stops being primarily a distributor and becomes a full-spectrum entertainment conglomerate.For years, Disney has been the only company with true franchise supremacy. Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and Disney Animation feed into a global ecosystem of films, streaming, merchandise, parks and cruises. It has been the only studio able to dominate theatre schedules and streaming algorithms simultaneously.Netflix acquiring Warner Bros challenges that supremacy for the first time in a meaningful way. Disney and Netflix will now sit on comparable piles of narrative universes. Where Disney has Marvel, Netflix will have DC. Where Disney has Star Wars, Netflix will hold the worlds of Game of Thrones and Harry Potter. Where Disney has a robust theatrical pipeline, Netflix will now have one too.Disney remains a powerhouse, but it now competes with an entity that has both greater digital reach and an equally recognisable roster of franchises. Its task becomes maintaining cultural momentum in an environment where Netflix’s catalogue will suddenly look far deeper and far more emotionally familiar to audiences across the world.For smaller studios, the landscape becomes far more challenging. Paramount, which had aggressively pursued Warner as a way to bulk up, now finds itself exposed. Its franchises – Mission: Impossible, Top Gun, Star Trek, Nickelodeon – are valuable but not enough to compete with the consolidated libraries of Netflix–Warner or Disney. A merger or sale appears increasingly likely simply to remain viable.NBCUniversal’s Peacock also misses the chance to absorb HBO content. Sony, lacking a major streaming platform of its own, must choose whether to remain a licensing powerhouse or seek deeper alliances. In an environment dominated by scale, mid-sized players face enormous pressure either to specialise or to consolidate.From an analytical standpoint, the streaming landscape is now evolving into a three-pole system: Netflix–Warner, Disney and Amazon–MGM. Other services may continue to exist, but most will orbit these core ecosystems rather than challenge them directly.For a decade, streaming was framed as the insurgent force attacking Hollywood’s old order. Netflix was the outsider; studios were the establishment. Cable bundles, release windows and theatrical exclusivity were the system Netflix sought to disrupt.This deal erases that divide completely. When the world’s largest streaming service acquires a studio that defined Hollywood’s golden age, the categories collapse. Streaming is no longer the challenger; streaming becomes the industry’s organising principle. Theatrical releases become one element of a multi-platform strategy anchored in global subscriptions and long-term intellectual property.Hollywood’s centre shifts from geography to architecture: whoever controls the universes – and the pipeline that delivers them – controls the culture.For audiences, the benefits will appear slowly but unmistakably. More iconic films and series will live under a single subscription. HBO’s prestige slate, Warner’s classics, DC’s superheroes, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and Netflix originals will eventually coexist on one platform. Convenience will increase, even as questions about pricing and competition intensify.For creators, the merger brings both opportunity and uncertainty. Netflix–Warner will become the world’s most powerful buyer of scripted content, capable of financing ambitious projects at scale. Yet consolidation also means fewer independent bidders for talent and a need to reconcile HBO’s creator-driven culture with Netflix’s data-driven commissioning.And for Hollywood, this is a turning point.

The streaming giant is now in exclusive negotiations to purchase Warner Bros Discovery’s film and television studios, as well as its streaming businesses, after putting forward an offer priced at $28 per share, according to a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of HBO, has spent months weighing strategic options. A second round of bids arrived this week following initial proposals from Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Reuters previously reported that Netflix submitted a mostly cash offer and ultimately surfaced as the frontrunner.At $28 per share, Netflix’s bid exceeds Warner Bros Discovery’s closing price of $24.54 on Thursday, and also tops a nearly $24 proposal made by Paramount that covered the company’s entire portfolio, including its cable channels such as CNN, TNT and TBS.The move marks another bold shift in Netflix’s strategy as it pushes beyond its core subscription business to tap additional revenue sources. Securing Warner Bros, home to franchises including Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and DC Comics, would place Netflix in control of some of the world’s most valuable entertainment properties and move it towards becoming a vertically integrated powerhouse that produces, distributes and monetises major IP on its own platforms.The company has also been extending its reach into gaming, live content and consumer experiences.Bloomberg News reported that Netflix is willing to pay a breakup fee of $5 billion if regulators block the transaction, and that the two companies could unveil a formal agreement within days, according Reuters.The possibility of the takeover has triggered industry pushback. Variety reported that a consortium of prominent film figures has called on the US Congress to intervene should Netflix’s attempt succeed, warning of a “looming economic and institutional crisis” across Hollywood.Meanwhile, CNBC said on Thursday that Paramount has accused Warner Bros of conducting a sale process that unfairly benefits Netflix over other bidders. The network cited a letter sent by the newly merged media company.""We strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders,"" Paramount's legal team wrote in the letter, cited by Reuters.The latest bidding follows a failed attempt earlier this year: in October, Warner Bros declined an estimated $60 billion takeover offer from Paramount for the entire business before launching a more structured sales process for its assets.","Netflix is in exclusive negotiations to purchase Warner Bros Discovery's film and television studios, as well as its streaming businesses.

Vetting and screening of non-citizens will be increased: USCIS

The Trump administration has once again introduced new changes, making its immigration policy more restrictive.On Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its Policy Manual to sharply limit the length of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for several categories of immigrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, and applicants awaiting adjustment of status.Under the new policy, the maximum duration for initial and renewal work permits will drop from five years to 18 months for refugees, people granted asylum, those with withholding of removal, and applicants with pending cases for asylum, adjustment of status or other humanitarian relief, as per press release.The change applies to employment authorization applications filed or pending on or after December 5, 2025.USCIS said the shift is intended to increase the frequency of vetting and screening for noncitizens seeking authorization to work in the United States as part of a broader immigration enforcement push.“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,"" Director Joseph Edlow said.He also pointed out the recent attack on National Guard and said that such incidents made vetting necessary so that the government can stop ""aliens.""After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens,"" Edlow added.Separately, recent requirements in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law July 4, 2025, will cap work authorization at one year — or the end of an individual’s parole or Temporary Protected Status (TPS) period, whichever is shorter — for immigrants paroled as refugees, those granted or applying for TPS, other parolees, and spouses of entrepreneur parole recipients. Those limits apply to any work permit applications filed or pending on or after July 22, 2025, when USCIS published a notice in the Federal Register outlining implementation.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its Policy Manual to sharply limit the length of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for several categories of immigrants.

'Do Not UNDERESTIMATE Russia': Jeffrey Sachs Big Message To 'DELUSIONAL' U.S. & Trump

The United States has temporarily lifted some restrictions on Lukoil-branded fuel stations operating outside Russia, allowing them to continue running despite sanctions placed on the parent company.The treasury department confirmed on Thursday that these stations — including those in the US — can keep serving customers without enabling revenue to move back to Russia, which remains under extensive American and European sanctions over its actions in Ukraine.The exemption will stay in force until 29 April 2026, reported Reuters.The relaxation marks a partial suspension of measures introduced by US President Donald Trump in October.The announcement comes in the same week US officials met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as part of efforts to advance a Washington-backed plan to end the conflict.Lukoil’s footprint outside Russia is substantial. The company operates around 200 stations across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York.Its Finnish subsidiary Teboil, which runs roughly 430 fuel stations, has already begun winding down operations as supplies diminish, with expectations that Lukoil will eventually sell the chain.Beyond this, the firm remains a dominant retail player in Moldova and Bulgaria and manages about 600 outlets in Turkey and over 300 in Romania.The decision to soften restrictions comes against the backdrop of wider sanctions imposed by Washington.The US placed its first major penalties on Lukoil and Rosneft, freezing all American-based assets and banning US firms from engaging with them.The companies, which together contribute around 55% of Russia’s petroleum output, were added to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.Businesses were given until 21 November to cut ties or risk secondary sanctions that could limit access to US banking, shipping and insurance services.India’s energy sector is also feeling the impact. New US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil have turned their crude into a “sanctioned molecule,” analysts said, as per PTI.Although India imported an average of 1.7 million barrels per day of Russian crude this year — with November expected to touch 1.8–1.9 million bpd — inflows are forecast to drop sharply to about 4,00,000 bpd in December and January.Several refiners, including Reliance Industries and HPCL-Mittal Energy, have paused purchases, with only Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy continuing supplies due to its dependence on Russian barrels.Experts say the restrictions apply specifically to designated companies, not to all Russian crude.This allows Indian buyers to legally source barrels from non-sanctioned producers such as Gazprom Neft or Surgutneftegaz, provided no blacklisted entity is involved in shipping, banking or trading.Reliance, which operates one of the world’s largest refining complexes, has already stopped using Russian crude in its export-oriented SEZ refinery to comply with upcoming EU rules.","The exemption will stay in force until 29 April 2026.

CNN reported that the acquisition follows an agreement reached in April, under which Prada committed to purchasing Versace for about $1.51 billion, a deal that materialised after Capri Holdings’ planned sale to Tapestry fell apart because of an antitrust challenge.Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of Prada founders Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, is set to assume the role of executive chairman at Versace. Speaking about the extended discussions that paved the way for the deal, he said, ""There had already been contacts during the Covid period, and there were talks even before Capri's sale to Tapestry. When that deal fell through over antitrust issues, we came back and tried to speed things up. It was something that had been in the works for a long time.”With the acquisition now finalised, Versace — established in 1978 by Gianni Versace in Milan — becomes part of the group that owns both Prada and Miu Miu. Bertelli, who pushed for the acquisition, said the brand met two important criteria: it carried manageable financial risk and held strong global value.The transition comes shortly after Donatella Versace stepped aside as creative chief following 30 years in the position. She was succeeded by Dario Vitale, previously the design director at Miu Miu.","Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of Prada founders, is set to assume the role of executive chairman at Versace.

IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

Airbus has been grappling with a fresh wave of setbacks, highlighting the mounting strain on its sprawling but fragile supply chain.The past week offered a stark reminder that the planemaker is not immune to the production troubles affecting the wider aviation industry, where supply shortages and labour gaps persist even years after the pandemic ended.Early Wednesday, the planemaker was forced to cut its long-standing aircraft delivery target for the year after discovering that a lesser-known Spanish supplier had provided out-of-specification aircraft panels, a blow that highlighted how vulnerable the €155-billion ($181-billion) manufacturer remains to disruptions among smaller vendors.Last Friday, Airbus issued an urgent directive for a software update across approximately 6,000 A320 aircraft, its flagship fleet, after identifying a potential fault in the interface between onboard computers and the flight-control system.Three days later, Airbus revealed a quality issue involving metal panels used in the fuselage of the same jet, triggering the need for detailed inspections of more than 600 aircraft already in service or at various stages of production.“The pressures of quarterly results, sometimes the pressures of competition, probably the quality drops a little bit,” Tony Fernandes, founder of AirAsia, was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.“It’s a good warning for everybody.”The one-two setback this week rattled investors, leading to Airbus’s worst trading day since April.The contrast was especially stark as Boeing, buoyed by a renewed optimism over its financial recovery, posted its strongest stock gains in months.On Tuesday, Boeing offered a series of upbeat forecasts, from increased deliveries of its 737 and 787 jets next year to a long-awaited return to positive cash flow after years of heavy outflows. Investors welcomed the outlook, sending the US plane maker's shares up by as much as 10 per cent, as cited by Bloomberg.Boeing has been slowly pulling itself out of a years-long crisis that began in late 2018 with the first of two fatal crashes, deepened during the Covid-19 pandemic, and worsened again in early 2024 when lapses in workmanship led to another near-disaster mid-flight.The situation was compounded further late last year, when a debilitating strike brought production to a standstill for weeks and drained the company’s resources.Since then, however, the storied US manufacturer has staged a steady comeback under new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who has overhauled management and set a sharper operational direction. Boeing has also benefited from strong backing from the White House, with the US president frequently leveraging aircraft orders in global negotiations and trade discussions.Airbus’ recent setbacks are still unlikely to reach the scale of Boeing’s turmoil last year. The company has already resolved the software issue over the weekend, minimising operational disruptions, and says most of the fuselage panels under inspection are expected to be compliant.However, the revised delivery timeline will leave some airlines waiting even longer for their aircraft, even as carriers rush to upgrade their fleets to keep pace with surging global travel demand.With China’s bid to challenge the long-standing duopoly still in its early stages, the fortunes of Airbus and Boeing remain tightly intertwined.Now, as Airbus targets a monthly production rate of 75 A320-family aircraft by 2027 and Boeing boosts output of its bestselling 737, both manufacturers face the same pressure: scaling up while preserving quality and ensuring that a fragile global supply chain can support their ambitions.","Airbus has been grappling with a fresh wave of setbacks, highlighting the mounting strain on its sprawling but fragile supply chain.

How will this impact Indian techies?





Newsweek

The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that it had increased vetting of H-1B visa applicants for highly skilled workers, instructing that anyone involved in ""censorship"" of free speech should be considered for rejection, according to an internal State Department memo.H-1B visas allow US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields and are crucial for US tech companies, which recruit heavily from countries including India and China. Many of those companies’ leaders threw their support behind Trump in the last presidential election.The cable, sent to all US missions on December 2, ordered US consular officers to review resumes or LinkedIn profiles of H-1B applicants and family members travelling with them to see if they had worked in areas including misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety.In a press release, the US department said that all the applicants need to change their profile setting from private to public.""As of December 15, the Department will expand the requirement that an online presence review be conducted for all H-1B applicants and their dependents, in addition to the students and exchange visitors already subject to this review. To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for H-1B and their dependents (H-4), F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to “public,"" the statement read.""If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible,"" under a specific article of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the cable said.Details on the enhanced vetting for H-1B visas, including the focus on censorship and free speech, had not been previously reported. The State Dept did not respond to a request for comment on the contents of the cable.The cable said all visa applicants were subject to this policy but sought a heightened review for H-1B applicants given they frequently worked in the technology sector ""including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression.""""You must thoroughly explore their employment histories to ensure no participation in such activities,"" the cable said.The new vetting requirements applied to both new and repeat applicants.The Trump administration made free speech, particularly what it saw as the stifling of conservative voices online, a focus of its foreign policy. Officials repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they said was suppression of right-wing politicians, including in Romania, Germany and France, accusing European authorities of censoring views like criticism of immigration in the name of countering disinformation.In May, Rubio threatened visa bans for people who censored speech by Americans, including on social media, and suggested the policy could target foreign officials regulating US tech companies.The Trump administration had already significantly tightened its vetting of applicants for student visas, ordering US consular officers to screen for any social media posts that might be hostile towards the United States.As part of his wide-ranging crackdown on immigration, Trump in September imposed new fees on H-1B visas.Trump and his Republican allies had repeatedly accused the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden of encouraging suppression of free speech on online platforms, claims that had centred on efforts to stem false claims about vaccines and elections.The H-1B visa is relied on heavily by Indian tech professionals, meaning stricter US vetting rules will disproportionately affect Indian applicants. Under the Trump administration’s new policy, certain categories of Indian workers are now more vulnerable to delays, intensive questioning and potential denials — and, for the first time, even spouses and children will face expanded background checks. The change adds a new layer of uncertainty for thousands of Indian families in the US immigration pipeline.According to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) reported by, only three Indian firms ranked among the top 25 employers with approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in fiscal year 2025.The top seven Indian companies together secured just 4,573 H-1B approvals for initial employment in FY25 — a 70% drop from FY15 and a 37% decline compared to FY24. By contrast, US tech giants such as Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google dominated new approvals, highlighting the increasingly central role of American companies in sponsoring high-skilled foreign workers, the report said.","Trump administration has increased vetting of H-1B visa applicants for highly skilled workers.

‘Challenge to our system’: Malaysia cracks down on illegal Bitcoin mining; power theft losses reach $1.1 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/challenge-to-our-system-malaysia-cracks-down-on-illegal-bitcoin-mining-power-theft-losses-reach-1-1-billion/articleshow/125757144.cms,"AP file photo

Malaysian authorities are stepping up their crackdown on illegal Bitcoin mining after uncovering nearly 14,000 illicit sites over the past five years and reporting about $1.1 billion in power-theft losses for state utility Tenaga Nasional (TNB).With cases rising sharply, including around 3,000 power-theft incidents linked to mining recorded by early October, the government last month launched a cross-agency taskforce involving the finance ministry, Bank Negara Malaysia, and TNB to coordinate action against rogue operators.Bitcoin mining in Malaysia is legal, provided operators obtain electricity legitimately and pay the required taxes. However, illegal miners use racks of high-powered “rigs” that perform trillions of calculations to validate transactions and earn coins, often tapping stolen electricity to keep their operations running.“Even if you run it properly, the challenge is that the market itself is very volatile,” Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, the deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, quoted as saying by Bloomberg. “I don’t see any well-run mining that can be considered as successful legally.”Authorities are using a range of tactics to track illegal Bitcoin mining operations. Drones sweep over rows of shops and abandoned buildings, detecting unexpected heat signatures from machines that shouldn’t be running.On the ground, police deploy handheld sensors to identify irregular electricity use. At times, investigations rely on residents reporting unusual sounds, which have revealed miners masking the roar of their machinery with natural noises.Illegal operators are increasingly cautious, frequently moving between empty storefronts and deserted houses. They use heat shields to conceal the glow of their rigs and secure entrances with CCTV, heavy-duty locks, and broken-glass deterrents to prevent unauthorised access. Together, these measures illustrate the lengths both authorities and miners go to in the ongoing effort to enforce the law.“The risk of allowing such activities to happen is no longer about stealing,” said Akmal. “You can actually even break our facilities. It becomes a challenge to our system.”Globally, Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than the entire countries of South Africa or Thailand. According to a report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, over 75 per cent of mining activity now occurs in the United States. Malaysia’s share of the industry is less clear. In January 2022, the country accounted for 2.5 per cent of the global hashrate, a measure of computational power, but Cambridge has not published updated figures in its latest survey.Around 80 per cent of the country’s domestic electricity is generated from coal or natural gas. Across the region, fossil fuels continue to make up roughly three-quarters of the power mix, according to the International Energy Agency, as cited by DW.Last week, Malaysia’s Ministry of Energy Transition and Water announced the formation of a multi-agency committee to tackle the rising problem of electricity theft linked to cryptocurrency mining.","Malaysian authorities are stepping up their crackdown on illegal Bitcoin mining.

EU's €3 Billion Plan to End Dependence on China for Rare Earths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-rare-earth-push-brussels-rolls-out-3-bn-plan-to-slash-china-dependence-new-supply-hub-and-export-curbs-in-pipeline/articleshow/125748125.cms,"'Hostile...': Explosive Europe Vs China Standoff Over Rare Earths; Ursula Vows 'Retaliation' With G7

Squeezed between China and US

The European Union on Wednesday rolled out a multi-billion-euro strategy to reduce its dependence on China for rare earths, unveiling measures to boost domestic mining, refining and recycling capacity amid rising geopolitical pressure on critical supply chains.The plan comes after months of turbulence triggered by Beijing’s export controls, according to AFP, which have disrupted manufacturers in autos, electronics and defence and exposed the bloc’s vulnerability to raw-materials shocks.EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said the bloc was “responding to the new global geopolitical reality” as the European Commission announced nearly €3 billion to support strategic projects both within the EU and in partner countries. He has previously likened China’s dominance to a rare-earths “racket”.A central feature of the new push is a European Centre for Critical Raw Materials, designed as a supply-hub modelled on Japan’s state-run JOGMEC. The centre will monitor demand, coordinate joint procurement for member states, and manage stockpiles and emergency deliveries to companies.Brussels also proposed curbing exports of scrap and waste from permanent magnets starting next year, to stimulate domestic recycling.Targeted restrictions on aluminium waste will follow, and copper could be added later.Despite adopting a critical raw-materials law two years ago, the bloc finds itself caught between Beijing’s tightening export regime and intensified US efforts under President Donald Trump to secure mineral access through bilateral deals.A new survey by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China found that 60% of European firms expect supply-chain disruptions due to Chinese government restrictions, while 13% fear they may need to halt or slow production.Updating its “economic security” doctrine the same day, the Commission said global trade tensions had made existing vulnerabilities sharper. “Trade is being weaponised. Supply chains are under pressure,” EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said while presenting the plan.“Strategic choke points are turning economic dependency into political pressure, and this hits our companies every single day,” he added.The revised doctrine calls for more assertive use of tools such as foreign-investment screening, export controls and supplier diversification — and for developing new mechanisms where gaps persist.“Europe will continue to champion open trade,” Sefcovic said, “but our openness must be backed by security.”","EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said the bloc was “responding to the new global geopolitical reality’ EU Commission announced nearly €3 billion to support strategic projects both within the EU and in partner countries.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

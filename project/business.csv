About Swiggy

Swiggy IPO : Food delivery and quick commerce platform Swiggy’s IPO worth Rs 11,324 crore opens today. It consists of Rs 4,500 crore fresh issue and remaining as an offer for sale.

Despite these challenges, India's quick commerce potential makes this IPO attractive for long-term investors, though business execution risks persist, the analysis says.Market analysts have diverse opinions regarding the Swiggy IPO, considering the company's present financial condition, market competition, and valuation metrics. However, the food delivery sector's growth potential makes it a considerable option for long-term investors.""As of the fiscal year 2024, Swiggy continues to operate at a loss, in contrast to its competitor, Zomato, which has recently achieved profitability. We advise investors to Avoid this IPO until the company's financial performance and growth outlook improve.

What will Donald Trump as US President mean for Indian stock markets? Top advantages & disadvantages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-will-donald-trump-as-us-president-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-top-advantages-disadvantages/articleshow/115005808.cms,"India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

"Deposit rates at peak, RBI cut likely in Feb: SBI chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/deposit-rates-at-peak-rbi-cut-likely-in-feb-sbi-chief/articleshow/115156869.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Even as SBI’s deposit rates have peaked, C S Setty, chairman of the country’s largest bank, expects RBI to cut interest rates by a moderate 25 basis points only in Feb 2025. SBI aims to grow its deposits by differentiating itself on services available and offering premium services to those with a total relationship value of over Rs 30 to Rs 50 lakh.“Our house view is that the first rate cut will probably happen only in Feb, which means until then, depositors would continue to have the rate of interest that we have currently, without any reduction. As far as retail loan customers are concerned, they may have to wait up to Feb,” Setty said, while addressing analysts after its results announcment on Friday. He added that interest rates on deposits have peaked.Setty’s comments on the rate cut come a few days after RBI governor Shaktikanta Das warned of even higher inflation numbers for Oct that would surpass Sept’s 5.5%. While RBI has projected consumer price index inflation at 4.5% for FY25, last week, it cautioned of ‘significant upside risks to inflation’ from factors including geopolitical tensions, commodity prices, and unexpected rains during harvest. If RBI cuts rates in Feb, it will be its longest pause since it last hiked rates in Feb 2023.SBI has analysed its base of 50 crore customers, categorised them into promoters, stagnators and attritors and has drawn out a strategy for every segment. “One of the initiatives we have taken is differentiation in the wealth segment, targeting the lower end of this segment. We have also revamped the IT platform for wealth management and want to build this segment as a strong franchise,” Vinay Tonse, MD at SBI, said.Setty said that a reduction in the repo rate would have a limited impact on the bank’s earnings as 42% of its loans are linked to the marginal cost of lending rate , which reflects the cost of deposits and which is rising. “We have had two to three enhancements in the MCLR, and the rate cut, even if it happens, will be a relatively smaller rate cut,” he said. He added that these hikes will protect the bank’s margins by 20 basis points. It also protects its margins by offering unsecured retail loans on a fixed rate basis.","C S Setty, chairman of the country’s largest bank, expects RBI to cut interest rates by a moderate 25 basis points only in Feb 2025.

Compliance to growth: Boards don diverse hats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/compliance-to-growth-boards-don-diverse-hats/articleshow/115156642.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Boards have evolved significantly, looking beyond their traditional role in corporate governance to also serve as engines of growth, driving innovation and strategic decision-making. Five years ago, the focus was primarily on compliance .This marks a shift from a passive, compliance-driven mindset towards a more proactive approach, where boards engage in substantive dialogue and encourage innovative thinking, a survey by global search firm Executive Access, commissioned by TOI, reveals.In light of this, boards recognise the need for greater meritocracy in selecting members, especially in today’s fast-changing and volatile business environment. They are increasingly leaning on individuals of high calibre with necessary intellectual and professional breadth, the survey of 120 board members said.“The survey indicates that boards today are more evolved and have moved beyond corporate governance. A well-structured, business-savvy board can significantly drive growth,” says Ronesh Puri, MD, Executive Access (India).Additionally, talent is increasingly drawn to boards that embody strong values and foster open discussions. The survey examined how the role and focus of boards have evolved.Harsh Goenka, chairman, RPG Enterprises, says, “In the past, corporate boards were often a mere legal formality, convened to tick the compliance box. Today, they’ve transformed into a powerful strategic necessity, pivotal in defining a company’s trajectory.”“Leadership teams are no longer just seeking approval; they’re actively seeking guidance and insights from the board. Boards are expected to help open new doors, leverage their networks, and provide strategic connections. Today, it’s about ensuring technology is harnessed, strategies are implemented, and succession planning is robust,” he adds.In the BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, and Incomprehensible) world, preparing businesses for future has become crucial. The advent of AI has increased risks compared to a decade ago, and the potential for innovation to disrupt or even render a business obsolete is significant. As a result, board members are more concerned about business continuity than ever before.Nikhil Ojha, partner at Bain & Co and head, strategy practice, Asia Pacific, says, “Many board members now recognise their fiduciary responsibility not just in terms of defensive “do no harm” but also as stewards of shareholder value creation agenda. They are, therefore, holding management accountable towards driving full potential from the core, and also growing new Engine-2 businesses.”Another key finding is that due to the funding winter and heightened investor focus on profitability, board members now believe the bottomline is significantly more important than chasing topline growth.Just two to three years ago, during the valuation boom, more companies prioritised topline growth. Companies such as Byju’s and Paytm have paid a heavy price for focusing solely on topline growth, the expert added.Some like Siraj Chaudhry, who serves on boards of Jubilant Ingrevia and Carrier Air Conditioning, believe that the transformation aligns with the broader changes at India Inc.The board has to be mindful that the key management personnel are completely aligned. Hence, the role of the Audit and Risk Management Committee has become increasingly critical, notes Daljit Singh, former president, Fortis Healthcare.","Five years ago, the focus was primarily on compliance.

Trump’s agenda

Institutional demand

Bitcoin rallied past $81,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump ’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers.Trump was declared the winner in Arizona, marking a clean sweep of the seven US battleground states. His decisive victory in the presidential election has prompted celebratory chest-thumping from the digital-asset industry, which spent over $100 million backing a range of crypto-friendly candidates.The largest token climbed as much as 6.1% on Sunday and hit an unprecedented $81,497 early in Asia on Monday, before changing hands at $80,835 as of 9:30 a.m. in Singapore. Bullish sentiment lifted smaller coins too, including a surge in Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favorite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk “With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros.Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets. Jubilant traders for the moment are paying little heed to questions such as the speed of likely implementation or whether a strategic stockpile is a realistic possibility.His broader agenda of stoking domestic economic growth, tax cuts and reducing red tape has fueled a buying spree across stocks, credit and crypto. The S&P 500 equity index last week hit its 50th record this year.Bitcoin has added about 93% so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the token, which scaled fresh records after Tuesday’s US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold.The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc.’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A day earlier, the iShares ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak — all signs of how Trump’s victory is reshaping crypto.“We believe a significant portion of the institutional market de-risked in the lead-up to the election and is now re-entering post Trump’s win, creating material buying pressure — this is likely to be ongoing for some time yet,” said Richard Galvin, founder of crypto-focused investment firm DACM.Trump’s stance contrasts with a crackdown on digital assets under President Joe Biden. Securities & Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler repeatedly labeled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency turned the screws on crypto following a 2022 market rout and a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange.Digital-asset companies spent heavily during the election campaign to boost candidates viewed as favorable to their interests. Against that backdrop, Trump did an about-face, becoming a supporter of an industry he once labeled a scam.“Trump has promised supportive regulation, and the sweep of the House and the Senate makes the passage of crypto bills much more likely,” wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.","Bitcoin rallies past $81,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump ’s embrace of digital assets.

Deep divisions among some emerging economies and the G7 on the issue of the situation in West Asia have also emerged as a stumbling block to forge a consensus.“The three priorities of the Brazilian presidency are fight against hunger and poverty, sustainable development and energy transition and global governance reform,” said Kant, adding that it will also witness the launch of the global alliance against hunger and poverty, which India has strongly backed along with other members of the group.“India is pushing the voice of the Global South and India is emerging as a leader which is carrying all the concerns of the Global South. We are also pushing for technology in a very big way. The legacy of India’s New Delhi leaders’ declaration and outcomes have been carried forward in all working groups.”New Delhi is also pushing for progress on climate finance and has outlined its position that it needs to be significantly enhanced from “billions to trillions” dollars to combat climate change and a mechanism needs to be set up to track the financing needs of countries. It is also pushing for low-cost concessional financing for developing countries but officials say that the discussions on climate at the summit would be “contentious.”While India has strongly backed progress on issues linked to gender as outlined in the New Delhi Leader’s declaration, some countries have taken a “conservative approach” and so far have adopted a tough stance on the issue. The G7 is also pushing for what it calls “forward looking language” on the topic.Kant said India will also call for “bold reforms” of the multilateral trading system, including the World Trade Organisation, which can help push sustainable economic growth and trigger economic resurgence and lead to a “more inclusive, prosperous and interconnected world.”The US election results and Donald Trump’s victory have cast a shadow on the G20 meeting. The meeting will be among the outgoing president Joe Biden’s last major international engagements and given Trump’s stance on several issues, including addressing climate change, the outcome may not have much significance","India will throw its weight behind Brazil to forge a consensus at the G20 leaders meeting next week. New Delhi will press for progress on issues linked to debt, climate and gender. Deep divisions among some emerging economies and the G7 on the issue of the situation in West Asia have emerged as a stumbling block.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115156935,imgsize-25220,width-400,resizemode-4/115156935.jpg"

BENGALURU: Senior employees of TCS saw significant reductions in their quarterly variable pay for the Sept quarter, receiving 20-50% of the payout even though they fulfilled the mandatory office attendance criteria.“HR has told us that they are not aware of why this has happened. For some other accounts, the message has gone through a project allocation index where any unit’s performance during the quarter is considered for variable pay,” an employee told TOI.In response to TOI’s query, TCS said, “For Q2FY25, we have paid out 100% QVA (quarterly variable allowance) to junior grades across the company.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021.

Budget 2024: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday addressed a CII post- Budget 2024 conference, stating that in 10 years, his government has tripled India’s Budget. The last Budget presented by the Manmohan Singh government in 2014 was of Rs 16 lakh crore. Ten years later, the Union Budget 2024 presented by us a few days ago is Rs 48 lakh crore, which is three times, Modi said.Modi also said that the capital expenditure allocation under his governments has grown manifold.""Capital expenditure is called the biggest productive medium of resource investment,"" he said at the ‘Journey Towards Viksit Bharat: A Post Union Budget 2024-25' conference. In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government. PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

"Harness the wind, at sea",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/harness-the-wind-at-sea/articleshow/115148656.cms,"Tamil Nadu is just months away from the first tender for 500MW offshore wind energy. National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) is expected to float the tenders by March 2025. But it is behind Gujarat by at least a year in initiatives to tap offshore wind power, establishing infrastructure and laying under-sea cables to connect to the onshore grid.Though the delay is mostly attributed to the Centre, which is driving the initial 1GW offshore power project – 500MW each for Gujarat and TN — the state needs to push its case for faster implementation. Besides formulating an offshore wind energy policy, the govt could reach out to coastal communities to allay fears and enlist them in this effort that offers substantial employment.The estimate is that 70GW of offshore wind energy can be tapped off the Gujarat and TN coasts. Union govt plans to develop 37GW-38GW of offshore wind farms , that could cost 4.5 lakh crore, through investment from multiple sources.Of course, there are both positive and negative narratives about offshore wind power with some saying India has vast tracts of land and should go for solar and onshore wind projects. But prices have gone up 10-15 times for prime wind and solar areas and it is not easy to acquire land. The right of way for transporting turbines and blades is another area of concern.The right of way issue and land issue completely dissipate when it comes to offshore wind. And the pay load factor (PLF) estimate for offshore wind power in Tamil Nadu is 60% to 65%, much higher than the 30%-40% for onshore.“TN is uniquely positioned for offshore wind energy generation. The wind is a lot stronger here than in Gujarat. Wind speeds of 7-8 m/sec, going up to 10 m/sec and guaranteed for 9-10 months a year make it similar to conditions in Europe. The tunnel effect due to Sri Lankan coast allows wind to come in and also protects the area from major cyclonic disturbances,” says Srijith Menon, head – green business, Aban Power Ltd.Investors see TN as a better option. “Tamil Nadu is already a pioneer when it comes to wind energy. This is the ‘karma bhoomi’ of wind, which means the supply chain — turbine, tower and component manufacturers – is already there. Offshore is a new opportunity to transition.”Of course, the engineering involved will be different. If Tamil Nadu can fully tap its offshore wind energy potential, it can replace existing thermal power plants for base power. That will be a significant cut in carbon emission. Imagine an entire state being run on renewable power 24x7.Experts say NIWE has just begun preparing wind data for TN with specific information such as accurate wind speed, duration. Gujarat already has this. “What we have now is just the satellite data, which is not sufficient for investors to go ahead. Data has to be collected for two seasons, comprising six months each, by engaging floating systems to identify the vantage points to erect windmills. Only after that can tenders can be floated,” says a private wind forecaster.At a recent industry conference, Rajesh Katyal, director-general, NIWE, sought to allay fears over viability gap funding and infrastructure. Lessons learned from the first 1GW projects will be implemented in subsequent phases, he says.The contract has already been awarded to the Power Grid Corporation to erect a transmission network for 500MW, says Anil Kumar Meena, general manager of central transmission utility. Procuring sub-sea cables will be challenge as there were no manufacturers in India, he says.But transitioning to manufacturing shouldn’t be difficult with the state’s existing ecosystem for engineering design and manufacturing. “Already, international companies such as Denmark’s Cowi operate out of Chennai with over 250 engineers designing offshore structures for the US and other markets,” says Francis Jayasurya, director - India, Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). Union govt wants to create a separate transmission network to evacuate power from offshore, but the state wants to use Tangedco’s infrastructure as it already has 765kVA transmission network. “From the state, what has to be done has been done. We have signed an agreement with the Union govt to purchase power at 4 per unit. Wind data compilation and ports development are the prerogative of the Union govt,” says Aneesh Sekhar, MD, TN Green Energy Corporation.",Tamil Nadu is just months away from the first tender for 500MW offshore wind energy.

The total number of arrested suspects in the case now stands at 23.Deputy SP, STF, Pramesh Shukla said Shiv Kumar had been in constant communication with his handlers while in hiding. During interrogation, Shiv Kumar is said to have admitted to his involvement in the murder.He disclosed that he and Dharmaraj Kashyap, both hailing from the same village, had worked together in the scrap business in Pune. It was during this time that they met Shubham Lonkar, who was connected to Lawrence Bishnoi's network, said Shukla. ""Through Snapchat, Shiv Kumar was put in touch with Anmol Bishnoi, Lawrence's brother who ordered the murder of Baba Siddique. The promise was lucrative: Rs 10 lakh for the job, with further financial support afterwards. To carry out the attack, Shiv Kumar and his accomplices were provided with firearms, cartridges, SIM cards, and mobile phones by Shubham Lonkar and Mohammad Yaseen Akhtar,"" said Shukla.According to the STF, Shiv Kumar and the other shooters tracked Baba Siddique's movements in Mumbai for several days. They chose the night of October 12 for the execution, knowing that Dussehra festival celebrations would be underway, increasing their chances of making a getaway. However, despite the chaos, two of the shooters, Dharmaraj Kashyap and Gurmail Singh, were caught at the scene; Shiv Kumar managed to escape.After fleeing the scene, Shiv Kumar is believed to have discarded his phone and made his way to Pune, then to Jhansi and Lucknow, before finally reaching Bahraich. Throughout his journey, he continued to communicate with his handlers, including Anurag Kashyap (who is the brother of the other arrested shooter Dharmaraj Kashyap) and others, who arranged for his hideout in Bahraich and planned his eventual escape to Nepal, said police. When Mumbai crime branch subsequently received inputs on Shiva's whereabouts, they shared the information with the UP STP and sought help to nab him.A day after the murder, Lonkar, a Pune resident, who is suspected to be linked with jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, had posted a message on a social media platform claiming responsibility for the attack. Hours after posting the message, it was deleted. While his brother, Pravin, has been arrested for his role in the conspiracy, Lonkar is still at large. Jalandhar resident, Zeeshan Akhtar, an alleged key conspirator, is also wanted.The five arrested now include Shiva and his alleged accomplices including Anurag Kashyap, Gyan Prakash Tripathi, Akash Srivastava and Akhileshendra Pratap Singh. They are all residents of Gandara village of Bahraich's Kaiserganj. They are being brought to Mumbai and will be produced before a court on Monday.A Mumbai crime branch officer said that a team of six officers and 15 personnel had been searching for the accused for the last 25 days. The team included API Amol Mali, PSI Swapnil Kale, constables Vikas Chavan and Mahesh Sawant.After the murder, Shiv Kumar managed to evade authorities for weeks. Intelligence gathered by police teams suggested that Shiva, along with his accomplices, was hiding in Bahraich and planning to escape to Nepal. ""Our team had been searching for the accused for the last 25 days. We kept surveillance on 30 to 35 friends and family members of Shiv Kumar alias Shiva and zeroed in on the four associates. On Sunday, when the four associates of Shiva left their village on two bikes, the joint police team followed and intercepted them. From them, police got the information about the place where Shiva was staying. We went there and laid a trap for a couple of hours. He was taken into custody when he came to the place he was staying in,"" said a Mumbai police officer. Shiva was also working as a farmer in a nearby farm. Anurag and Tripathy had earlier visited Mumbai, said police. Shiva was planning to flee to Nepal, said police. The Mumbai crime branch had earlier issued look-out circulars against them.""We will question the accused thoroughly and will get more details about the murder, conspiracy, involvement of other accused,"" said a police officer.A Mumbai police officer said, ""Tripathy had sent Rs 2.5 lakh to Harish Kumar, an arrested accused. He was also in touch with Akhtar. Anurag had harboured and financed the other accused after the murder.

Bitcoin is closing in on $80,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers.The cryptocurrency climbed as much as 4.3% to an unprecedented $79,771 on Sunday and remained near $79,000 as of 2:05 p.m. in Singapore. Smaller tokens like Cardano and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also rallied.Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets. He emerged from Tuesday’s election in a stronger position than expected — his Republican Party has control of the Senate and is on the verge of holding a narrow majority in the House.“With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros.Bitcoin has added about 90% so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold.The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc.’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A day earlier, the iShares ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak — all signs of how Trump’s victory is reshaping crypto.Trump’s stance contrasts with a crackdown on digital assets under President Joe Biden. Securities & Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler repeatedly labeled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency turned the screws on crypto following a 2022 market rout and a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange.Digital-asset companies and executives spent heavily during the US election campaign to promote candidates viewed as favorable toward their interests.“Trump has promised supportive regulation, and the sweep of the House and the Senate makes the passage of crypto bills much more likely,” wrote Noelle Acheson, author of thenewsletter.","Bitcoin is closing in on $80,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets.

US stocks climb as Fed cuts interest rates by 0.25% to curb inflation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-climb-as-fed-cuts-interest-rates-by-0-25-to-curb-inflation/articleshow/115073308.cms,"The US stock market on Thursday continued its upward trend following the Federal Reserve's announcement to lower the interest rates by 0.25 per cent.This move by the Fed came as a response to the once high inflation that resulted in Trump winning the Presidential elections, dropping down towards the bank’s target of 2 per cent. The rate cut brought a wave of relief in the American economy as the policymakers took note of a job market that has ""generally eased"".However, the Fed's announcement had little impact on the market, as the cut, even with its exact magnitude, was widely anticipated by the investors.The market was almost certain of the central bank’s decision to cut in November. Investors are closely monitoring the central bank's next statements to gain insight into the future direction of interest rates.The S&P 500 rose 44.06 points to 5,973.10 or 0.7 per cent up, continuing its high from Tuesday after Donald Trump's presidential victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained mostly flat, with a minute dip of 0.59 to 43,729.34, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 285.99 to 19,269.46 or 1.5 per cent.The central bank started lowering rates in September, when the Federal Reserve announced a 0.50 per cent rate cut and signaled that further reductions were likely.The market’s direction even after the Fed cuts still remains uncertain as the result of Trump’s win, who is advocating for tariffs and other policies that could drive inflation higher as per economists.Investors have already begun speculations about the Fed rate cuts for the next year. Even though lower rates can boost the economy, they may also fuel inflation.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that for now, nothing is changing. “In the near term, the election will have no effects” on interest-rate policy, he said.Powell said that the Fed considers all the possible policy changes with any president and their effect on the economy and only then the officials decide on how the interest rates should be shaped.He also noted that the policy changes to be implemented if Trump returns to the White House remain uncertain.“We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,” he said.On Wall Street, healthcare services firm McKesson boosted the market with a 10.6 per cent rise after reporting a quarterly profit that exceeded analysts' expectations.Mobility service company Lyft surged 22.8 per cent after surpassing Wall Street's sales and profit expectations, while Ralph Lauren gained 6.6 per cent as strong demand from customers in Asia and Europe helped the company deliver better-than-expected profits.However, financial services firm JPMorgan Chase dropped 4.3 per cent, along with Goldman Sachs, which also contributed to the Dow Jones Industrial Average's slight decline.Smaller US stocks also emerged as market losses, with the Russell 2000 index down 0.4 per cent which previously had twice the gain expected by S&P 500.The stock that’s become most synonymous with the president-elect, Trump Media & Technology Group, fell 23 per centt.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury lowered to 4.33 per cent from 4.44 per cent late Wednesday,opposing the surge it gained on the previous day.The rise had been driven by expectations that Trump's plans for higher tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation could boost economic growth, increase US government debt, and lead to higher inflation.","The S&P 500 rose 44.06 points to 5,973.10 or 0.7 per cent up.

Fed's Powell: Will not quit even if asked by Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-says-he-will-not-quit-even-if-asked-by-trump/articleshow/115068042.cms,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear he’s ready to defend the US central bank from political pressure following the re-election of Donald Trump , saying he wouldn’t resign if asked and insisting the incoming president doesn’t have the power to fire him or other senior Fed leaders.“No,” Powell said firmly on Thursday, when asked whether he would step aside if Trump asked for his resignation.During a press conference following the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, Powell said repeatedly that Trump — who explored firing the Fed chief during his first term in the White House — lacks the legal authority to demote or remove the chair or other senior Fed officials in Washington.“What Powell is saying, in making the forceful statement that no one can be demoted, is that the Fed’s leadership is all in this together,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a professor and Fed historian at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “I see this as Powell’s declaration that the president-elect is going to have his say on shaping the Federal Reserve, but not until there are vacancies to be filled.”Powell’s remarks were striking as he worked hard to dodge every other politically-charged question lobbed at him from reporters. He strictly avoided speculating on what policies might emerge from the incoming administration. But he readily weighed in when the matter involved protecting the institution he’s served since 2012.“He’s a firm believer in the importance of Fed independence, and quitting voluntarily due to criticism from a president would show that the Fed isn’t independent,” Ian Katz, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, wrote in a note to clients.The comments, just two days after Trump’s re-election, portend the power struggle that may lie ahead between the central bank and a president who insists he should have a say on interest-rate policy.Trump, who won Tuesday’s election by an unexpectedly large margin, has often blasted Powell. Though Trump appointed him to the chair in 2018, he then quickly pivoted to publicly urging him to stop raising rates later in the year.Staunch InstitutionalistPowell, a staunch institutionalist reared among Washington’s elite, has often spoken about the importance of central bank independence. In an interview earlier this year, he cast his desire to serve out his full term as a part of that.Trump, for his part, has backed away from some of his more provocative statements about how much a president should influence the central bank. He told Bloomberg in June that he’d let Powell serve out his current term, which ends in 2026. But he’s also said a president should be allowed to at least make suggestions on policy.One potential target for the Trump administration is Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, the Fed’s top banking regulator who Republicans have repeatedly criticized.Speaking later Thursday on Bloomberg Television, Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, a leading contender to join Trump’s cabinet, said “everything should be on the table” when it comes to considering Barr’s position.“I would look at any legal option that we might have to make a change there,” he said.Ultimately, any attempt at firing or demoting Powell or his colleagues would probably face a battle in the courts. Many legal scholars have maintained that the president likely doesn’t have the authority to fire the central bank chair, but there could be a legal pathway for demoting the vice chair for supervision, some say.Rate CutThe Fed, meantime, delivered a quarter-point interest-rate cut on Thursday — the second-straight reduction. While the Fed is expected to lower rates further in the coming months, investors and economists have pared back expectations for how low rates will fall this cutting cycle, partly in response to Trump’s election.Trump has promised to deploy more aggressive tariffs, crack down on immigration and extend tax cuts — policies that could put upward pressure on prices and long-term interest rates.Powell reiterated that future policy decisions will depend on incoming economic data, and the Fed won’t try to anticipate fiscal or trade policy.“We don’t know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be,” Powell said. “We therefore don’t know what the effects on the economy would be, specifically whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.”The Fed chair committed to additional rate cuts in the future but not a timeline, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Stifel Financial Corp. He left “the door open for a potential policy pause at that December meeting should the data remain as solid as it has and should inflation remain as sticky as it has.”Powell noted the economy has been stronger than expected, and also pointed to a higher-than-hoped September inflation reading.Though he insisted all options remain on the table, the comments opened the possibility the Fed might take a pause from lowering rates at its December gathering — the final meeting of the year.“We’ll make a decision as we get to December,” Powell said, adding that policymakers will get more data before then.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says he won't resign if asked.

The decision was unanimous.But where the Jerome Powell-led Fed's previous policy statement noted slowing monthly job gains, the new one referred to the labour market more broadly. Even while the unemployment rate remains low, ""labour market conditions have generally eased,"" the statement said. Risks to the job market and inflation were ""roughly in balance,"" the Fed said, repeating language from the statement released after its Sept meeting. The new statement also slightly altered the reference to inflation, saying that price pressures had ""made progress"" towards the Fed's objective, rather than the prior language that it had ""made further progress"".The Fed statement will be interpreted in light of Republican President-elect Donald Trump's return to power in Jan. Trump, who defeated Kamala Harris, campaigned on promises ranging from steep tariffs on imports to a crackdown on immigration that could have a broad and unpredictable impact on the economic landscape the Fed will navigate in coming months as officials try to keep inflation contained and close to the central bank's target.","The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday as policymakers took note of a job market that has ""generally eased"" While inflation continues to move towards the US central bank's 2% target, risks to the job market and inflation were ""roughly in balance""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115065157,imgsize-1020829,width-400,resizemode-4/115065157.jpg"

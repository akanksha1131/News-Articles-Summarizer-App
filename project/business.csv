Succession





Rupert Murdoch’s family has finalised succession arrangements that hand control of his media empire to eldest son Lachlan Murdoch, ensuring Fox News retains its conservative direction.94-year old Murdoch, an Australian-born American tycoon, built one of the world’s largest media groups, with holdings including Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and outlets in the UK and Australia.The agreement, announced Monday, ends a long-running family dispute over control of Fox Corp and News Corp and settles questions of succession after Murdoch’s death.Under the deal, Lachlan will benefit from a new family trust alongside his younger sisters Grace and Chloe, Rupert’s children with Wendi Deng Murdoch. Lachlan has been serving as executive chairman of Fox Corp and chairman of News Corp, as reported by Reuters.Elder siblings Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch agreed to give up their claims. Each is expected to receive about $1.1 billion from the sale of personal holdings in Fox and News Corp over the next six months, raising roughly $1.37 billion. The shares were sold at a 4.5 per cent discount to their last closing prices.The new trust, valued at about $3.3 billion, will hold 36 per cent of Fox’s Class B common stock and 33 per cent of News Corp’s Class B shares, according to company statements.The deal follows a legal battle in Reno, Nevada, where a probate court last year blocked Rupert and Lachlan’s attempt to amend the existing trust, which had granted equal control to the four eldest siblings. The court ruled the move was made in “bad faith,” pushing the family toward settlement talks.The resolution, often compared to the plot of HBO’s, confirms Fox News will remain under conservative leadership. “You know that there will always be a conservative guardian of Fox News. And frankly, if I were a shareholder, I would really think this was a very good move,” said Claire Enders, founder of UK-based Enders Analysis.Fox News continues to dominate US cable news ratings and plays an influential role in American politics, particularly among Republicans and Donald Trump’s supporters.","94-year-old Murdoch built one of the world's largest media groups.

MUMBAI: The Securities Appellate Tribunal on Tuesday directed Sebi to explain within three weeks why it has not shared additional documents sought by US algorithmic trading firm Jane Street. SAT fixed Nov 18 as the next date of hearing on the hedge fund's appeal against the markets regulator's interim order.Jane Street, which was barred from trading in July and ordered to disgorge Rs 4,800 crore in alleged ill-gotten gains, has argued that Sebi denied it access to crucial material needed to mount a defence. The firm claims that Sebi's own surveillance department, in a Dec 2024 report, had found no evidence of manipulation, contradicting the findings of the investigation wing that passed the July order.Jane Street has sought 61 documents, including communications between Sebi and the NSE, and email exchanges with a whistle-blower trader, but Sebi has rejected the requests as ""fishing enquiries"" and said it cannot share material not relied upon in the order.The case against algorithmic trader Jane Street is a watershed moment in India's market regulation, with Sebi alleging that the firm manipulated benchmark indices by exploiting pricing gaps between the F&O and cash markets, particularly around index expiry.Jane Street's strategies yielded over Rs 36,500 crore in profits between 2023 and 2025, an unprecedented scale for a proprietary trading firm in India. Sebi said this distorted price discovery disadvantaged millions of retail investors who account for a third of F&O volumes, and highlighted systemic vulnerabilities.","Sebi must explain within three weeks why it has not shared additional documents sought by US algorithmic trading firm Jane Street.

NEW DELHI: In a significant development for the country's seafood industry, the European Union (EU) has listed 102 new Indian fishery units for export from India to EU member countries.

""This significant expansion reflects the growing confidence in India's food safety and quality assurance systems, and marks a major step forward in enhancing market access for Indian seafood products, specially aquaculture shrimps and Cephalopods (Squid, Cuttle fish and Octopus),"" said an official statement.The decision follows a series of meetings in EU and New Delhi, in which commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and senior officials of the commerce department participated, resulting in confidence in robust Indian official control mechanisms implemented by the Export Inspection Council (EIC).Indian seafood exports meet stringent international standards, particularly those laid down by the EU and the move also reflects India's commitment to food safety, traceability, and compliance with EU regulations and strengthens India's position as a trusted supplier of high-quality seafood.The commerce department is of the view that the decision will boost export volumes, generate employment, and enhance foreign exchange earnings. This development is also expected to significantly enhance India's seafood exports to the European Union, which is one of the most lucrative and quality-sensitive markets globally.","The European Union has listed 102 new Indian fishery units for export from India to EU member countries.

Switching to E20 blended fuel: Why are vehicle owners worried? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/switching-to-e20-blended-fuel-why-are-vehicle-owners-worried-explained/articleshow/123767582.cms,"Why are people concerned?

How to adjust with the change?

Who does it benefit?

What is E20?





The government’s rollout of E20, a new ethanol-blended petrol, has sparked panic and confusion across India, the world’s third-largest auto market.Since its nationwide rollout in April, the move has sparked public concern and confusion, with many worried about how it might affect their vehicles and calling for more options in ethanol fuel blends like the E10 and E5.Other nations like Brazil and the United States, also promote ethanol-based fuels, but provide motorists with a choice of blends. However, the absence of such options in India has caused frustration among drivers, who are worried about how E20 could affect the performance of older cars and two-wheelers.Many vehicle manuals only mention E5 or E10 as permitted fuels, which has added to public uncertainty. An auto industry body, not manufacturers directly, has tried to calm concerns, saying warranties and insurance claims will still be valid, Reuters reported.The government has said that E20 is the only way forward and admitted that older vehicles may have to undergo a “simple process,” replacing some rubber parts and gaskets to adapt to the change.The auto industry has majorly supported the E20 switch.Last week, lab tests indicated that fuel efficiency drops by 2–4% when using E20, with the reduction likely higher under real-world conditions and in older vehicles, though the fuel was still deemed safe.This represents a sharp shift from the industry’s long-held stance on E20, as back in 2020, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers had urged the government to provide E10 alongside E20 to ensure the “safe operation” of vehicles, warning that modifying older models would be a “mammoth task.”Sugar companies and distilleries stand to benefit from the change, including Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar, Balrampur Chini Mills and Shree Renuka Sugars, as higher demand for sugar feeds ethanol production, as per Reuters.Ethanol makers such as Praj Industries and CIAN Agro are also set to gain, the agency further added.Meanwhile, state-run oil firms Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation are expected to profit from lower crude imports.E20 is a mix of petrol with 20% ethanol, an alcohol largely produced from sugarcane and crops such as maize and rice. It was initially offered at select pumps in April 2023 and, from April 2025, has been expanded nationwide, throughout 90,000 pumps.The rollout replaces the widely used E10 fuel, which contains 10% ethanol and for which most vehicles in India were originally designed.Over the past few weeks, blends such as E10 and E5 have disappeared from filling stations, meaning consumers now have no alternative but to buy E20. The government argues the policy will cut dependence on imported oil, saving $5 billion in foreign exchange this year, while adding nearly $4.6 billion to farmers’ earnings. It also said that the blend is cleaner and less harmful to the environment.","E20 is a mix of petrol with 20% ethanol, an alcohol largely produced from sugarcane and crops such as maize and rice.

The US job market turned out to be much weaker in 2024 and the early part of this year than initially reported, newly released government figures have shown, adding to concerns about the state of the country's economy.Fresh estimates by the US labour department on Tuesday highlighted that employers hired 911,000 less workers between April 2024 to March than originally reported.The figures are part of annual benchmark revisions, which adjust for businesses that opened or closed during the period. These numbers are, however, preliminary, with the final set due in February 2026.The breakdown highlights major shortfalls in key sectors.Hotels, restaurants and other leisure and hospitality businesses accounted for 176,000 fewer jobs than earlier reported. Meanwhile, professional and business services firms also employed 158,000 fewer people, while retail companies were down by 126,000.The announcement comes just days after the department revealed that the economy created only 22,000 jobs in August, intensifying worries that US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable economic stance, including sudden tariffs on imports has unsettled employers and dampened hiring.This is the second year in a row the revisions have exposed a sharp slowdown. Last time's update cut 818,000 jobs from the April 2023 to March 2024 period. Trump, then running for president, argued the figures had been “rigged” to mask economic weakness and benefit Democrats ahead of the 2024 election. He did not explain why the government would publish such data two and a half months before the vote.With the labour market now looking weaker than previously believed, pressure is mounting on the Federal Reserve to act.","US job market much weaker in 2024 and early part of this year than initially reported, newly released government figures have shown.

Red sea undersea cables cut: What damaged submarine cables & impacted internet? Here is what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/red-sea-undersea-cables-cut-what-damaged-submarine-cables-impacted-internet-here-is-what-experts-say/articleshow/123787359.cms,"Houthis, Iran Unleash New Hybrid War At Sea? Undersea Cable Cuts Cripples Internet In These Regions

Poll Should international organizations take action against countries with frequent cable disruption incidents? Yes, definitely No, it's not necessary





Internet services in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East have been disrupted after undersea cables in the Red Sea were cut, highlighting the vulnerability of the global network infrastructure just a year after a similar incident.As the news came to light, many are left wondering as to what may have cut the lines.According to experts, the cables were likely damaged by commercial shipping activity in the region.The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) told AP that 15 submarine cables pass through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the narrow waterway between East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. This makes it one of the most critical and congested routes for global communications.Authorities identified damage to the South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4, the India-Middle East-Western Europe and the FALCON GCX cables. By Tuesday, the Europe India Gateway cable was also confirmed to have been affected, according to Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Kentik.Early reports indicated that the cables were cut near Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, though authorities and cable operators have not confirmed this.“Early independent analysis indicates that the probable cause of damage is commercial shipping activity in the region,” said John Wrottesley, the ICPC’s operations manager.“Damage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults,” John added.Madory told the AP that as per experts a commercial ship likely dropped its anchor and dragged it across the four cables, cutting them. Because some sections of the Red Sea are shallow, anchors can more easily damage the lines.Undersea cables form a key part of the global internet system, alongside satellites and land networks, with providers usually rerouting traffic when one link goes down.The disruptions affected at least 10 countries, including India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. While no nation went completely offline, internet providers lost significant portions of their international capacity.“Nobody’s completely offline, but each provider has lost a subset of their international transit,” Madory said. ""So if you imagine this is like an equivalent to plumbing and you lose some volume of water coming down the pipes ... and now you just have less volumes to carry the traffic.”Undersea cables form the backbone of the internet, carrying most of the world’s data traffic. Providers usually reroute through alternative links when one line is damaged, but this often causes slower connections and latency, AP reported.The incident comes against the backdrop of security fears in the Red Sea, where Houthi rebel attacks on ships have raised concerns about risks to undersea infrastructure.Earlier in 2024, Yemen’s internationally recognised government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to target cables. Several were later severed, possibly by a ship struck in one of the attacks dragging its anchor, though the Houthis denied responsibility.","Internet services in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East disrupted after undersea cables in the Red Sea were cut. 15 submarine cables pass through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the narrow waterway between East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.

The United States has strengthened its ties with Pakistan as Missouri-based US Strategic Metals signed a $500 million investment deal to boost foreign investment in the country’s mineral sector.Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organization, the largest miner of critical minerals, formalised the agreement on Monday through a memorandum of understanding with the American firm, paving the way for the establishment of a poly-metallic refinery in Pakistan.The agreement follows a trade pact signed between Washington and Islamabad last month, which Pakistan hoped would encourage US investment in its vast mineral and oil reserves, as per AP.US Strategic Metals specialises in producing and recycling critical minerals, which the US department of energy defines as crucial for advanced manufacturing and energy technologies.Another agreement was signed between Pakistan’s National Logistics Corp and Portuguese engineering and construction giant Mota-Engil Group.According to a statement from Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif’s office, he held talks with delegations from US Strategic Metals and Mota-Engil over Pakistan’s copper, gold, rare earths and other mineral resources.The statement said both sides agreed to work on setting up value-added facilities, boosting mineral processing capacity, and taking up large-scale mining projects. “The partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten, and rare earth elements,” it added, as cited by AP.The US embassy in Islamabad welcomed the development, saying in a statement, “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the US-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”Earlier this year, Sharif said Pakistan holds mineral reserves worth trillions of dollars, and that foreign investment could help the country overcome its prolonged financial crisis and reduce its dependence on massive foreign loans.Much of Pakistan’s mineral wealth lies in the insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, where separatist groups have opposed resource extraction by local and foreign firms. Earlier in August, the US state department designated the Balochistan National Army and its armed wing, the Majeed Brigade, as a foreign terrorist organisation.Deposits of oil and minerals have also been identified in Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, bordering Afghanistan, AP reported.The US Strategic Metals firm now joins the series of many international companies that have already entered Pakistan’s mining sector. Among them is Canadian firm Barrick Gold, which owns a 50% stake in the Reko Diq gold mine in Balochistan.","Missouri-based US Strategic Metals signs a $500 million investment deal to boost foreign investment in Pakistan's mineral sector.

PNC Financial Services has announced plans to acquire Colorado-based FirstBank in a $4.1 billion transaction, marking a significant expansion of its footprint in the US retail banking market.Headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado, FirstBank—also known as 1stBank—operates 120 branches and holds $26.7 billion in assets. The lender is privately held, though shareholders owning 45.7% of the company have already voted in favour of the merger, according to a joint disclosure, AP reported.“Its deep retail deposit base, unrivalled branch network in Colorado, growing presence in Arizona, and trusted community relationships make it an ideal partner for PNC,” Bill Demchak, chairman and chief executive officer of PNC, said in a statement.The deal cements PNC as the largest bank in the Denver market while expanding its Arizona network to more than 70 branches. With the acquisition, PNC’s total assets will rise to roughly $575 billion, putting it closer in size to rivals Capital One and US Bank.PNC has been aggressively growing through acquisitions, having purchased the US operations of Spanish lender BBVA for $11.6 billion after the pandemic. The Pittsburgh-based bank has also been adding branches across the Southwest.Alex Overstrom, head of retail at PNC, suggested further growth could follow. “We are not slowing down our organic growth but may consider opportunities as they arise,” he said in an interview.Industry analysts say the deal strengthens PNC’s status as a leading super regional bank, a category that includes lenders like Capital One and Huntington Bancshares. These institutions have been expanding rapidly to compete with Wall Street’s largest players such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.","PNC Financial Services has announced plans to acquire Colorado-based FirstBank in a $4.1 billion transaction.

In an attempt to pile on economic pressure on Russia, the European Union is weighing a fresh set of sanctions on Russian banks and oil trade to get President Vladimir Putin to end the war against Ukraine.According to a Bloomberg report, this proposed 19th set of measures since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war 2022 may include restrictions on Russian payment and credit card systems, cryptocurrency exchanges, and additional constraints on oil trade.The EU aims to synchronise certain sanctions with the United States, according to sources quoted in the report.

However, he has increased tariffs on India to 50% due to its ongoing Russian oil purchases.Whilst Russia faces severe, crippling sanctions from Western nations, it has managed to mitigate some effects by acquiring restricted goods from China and other nations, whilst finding new markets for its oil and gas products, including India.The US is considering additional measures, including sanctions on Russia's covert oil tanker fleet and energy companies Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, alongside other potential actions, as previously reported by Bloomberg.According to sources quoted in the report, the EU's restrictions would enhance sanctions on Russia's unofficial vessels and oil traders in third countries, potentially prohibiting re-insurance for designated tankers.The EU is considering stricter measures against major Russian oil firms by eliminating existing exemptions for companies like Rosneft. Additional considerations include expanding export prohibitions on military-industrial supplies and implementing trade restrictions on international companies, including Chinese firms, that provide these materials.Beijing has emerged as a crucial military supplier to Russia, particularly enabling Moscow to enhance its drone manufacturing capabilities used for attacking Ukrainian cities.The European Union is considering implementing its ""anti-circumvention tool"" against Kazakhstan for the first time, according to sources quoted in the Bloomberg report. This action would prohibit Kazakhstan from importing specific machinery that EU trade data suggests is being redirected to Russia for weapons manufacturing.Sources indicate that implementing this tool requires substantial evidence and unanimous support from EU member states. The proposed sanctions package may undergo modifications during discussions with EU member countries over the upcoming days and weeks.Additional contemplated measures include visa limitations, restrictions on ports handling sanctioned shadow vessels, and controls on military-related services, including artificial intelligence applications.EU ambassadors received a briefing about the proposed package during the weekend, with formal proposals expected to be presented in the near future.Also Read | The 50% misfire: How Trump made Russian oil cheaper for India - And Putin a winner","The European Union is weighing a fresh set of sanctions on Russian banks and oil trade.

China’s exports expanded in August but missed forecasts, weighed down by a sharp fall in shipments to the United States despite gains in Europe and Southeast Asia, official data showed Monday.According to news agency AFP, overall exports rose 4.4% year-on-year, lower than the 5.5% forecast by Bloomberg and down from July’s 7.2% growth.Shipments to the US, China’s largest single-country partner, sank 11.8% from July and 33.1% from a year earlier. However, exports to the European Union climbed 10.4%, while those to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations jumped 22.5%.Imports also grew at a slower pace, rising 1.3% against expectations of 3.4%, AFP reported.Imports totalled $219.5 billion, contributing to a trade surplus of $321.8 billion in August, although this marked the slowest export pace since early 2025, according to news agency AP.Analysts pointed to fading “frontloading” effects, where exporters had accelerated shipments ahead of tariff hikes. “The resilience of Beijing’s exports this year can also be attributed to Chinese businesses pushing for higher market share in other countries, exacerbated by weak domestic demand,” said Zhiwei Zhang of Pinpoint Asset Management, as quoted by AFP.Yue Su of the Economist Intelligence Unit said that “trade diversion remains evident”, reflecting supply-chain diversification to avoid tariffs, a trend also seen in the first US-China trade war.The numbers come as Beijing grapples with weak factory output, a property sector debt crisis and high youth unemployment.In August, Washington and Beijing had extended their tariff truce until November 10, freezing US duties at 30% and Chinese levies at 10%. Reuters noted that analysts expect exports to face pressure in coming months, with Capital Economics warning that “the temporary boost from the US-China trade truce is fading.”US President Donald Trump has repeatedly highlighted America’s leverage over China in the ongoing trade dispute. Speaking in August, he said Washington holds “incredible cards” over Beijing and added, “But I don’t want to play those cards. If I did, that would destroy China.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centres could emerge as major consumers of global water resources in the next few years, according to a report by Morgan Stanley.The report, as cited by news agency ANI, projected that annual water use for cooling and electricity generation may rise to around 1,068 billion litres by 2028, an 11-fold increase from 2024 levels.The report underlined that while direct water use for cooling is widely recognised, indirect consumption through electricity generation is often overlooked.It added that semiconductor manufacturing, which can consume up to five million gallons of ultrapure water daily, further adds to AI’s water footprint.Morgan Stanley highlighted three possible scenarios, estimating annual water use between 637 billion litres and 1,485 billion litres by 2028, depending on regional energy mixes, cooling technologies, and efficiency improvements. “AI data centers to drive annual water consumption for cooling and electricity generation to approximately 1,068 billion litres by 2028 (our base case) – an 11x increase from 2024 estimates,” the report stated.Electricity generation (scope 2) typically accounts for the largest share of AI-linked water use, followed by direct data centre cooling (scope 1) and semiconductor production (scope 3). More than half of the world’s top data centre hubs are already located in regions facing medium to high water stress, raising concerns of localised impact despite modest global averages.For context, a 2024 study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated that US data centres alone consumed 64 billion litres of water directly for cooling in 2023, with indirect water use through electricity generation reaching 800 billion litres.As per The Conversation, companies like Google and Meta disclosed that 95% of their total water use comes from data centre operations, with Google’s Iowa facility consuming 3.8 billion litres in a single year.As AI adoption accelerates, experts warn that efficient water resource management will be critical to ensure sustainability.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centres could emerge as major consumers of global water resources in the next few years.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

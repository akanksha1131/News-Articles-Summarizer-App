US Fed Meeting: Top Highlights & Takeaways

Recent economic indicators point towards sustained robust growth in economic activity, despite fluctuations in net exports affecting the data, the policy statement said.

US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

US Fed has forecasted higher inflation and lower US GDP growth. Officials at the Federal Reserve anticipate that inflation, based on their preferred measurement, will increase to 3% towards the end of this year, compared to 2.1% recorded in April.

Their projections indicate the unemployment rate will climb to 4.5%, up from the present rate of 4.2%.

The US GDP growth is expected to come down to 1.4% this year, showing a significant reduction from the previous year's 2.5%.

Labour market stability persists with low unemployment rates and steady employment conditions. Price levels continue to show moderate elevation, it said.

Whilst economic uncertainty has decreased, it still remains elevated. The Committee maintains vigilance regarding risks to both aspects of its dual mandate.

The Committee continues to evaluate incoming data's implications for economic prospects whilst determining suitable monetary policy stance. Should any risks surface that might hinder achieving the Committee's objectives, they stand ready to modify monetary policy accordingly. The evaluations encompass diverse factors, including labour market status, inflation metrics and expectations, alongside financial and global economic trends, the statement added.

US Fed Chair Defies Donald Trump

US Fed Meeting: The US Federal Reserve, led by chair Jerome Powell, kept interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, defying President Donald Trump ’s call for a rate cut.“In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the US Federal Reserve statement reads.The US central bank has maintained its key interest rate steady in the current year, ranging between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent. Market observers had widely anticipated that Fed officials will maintain their current position until inflation shows consistent signs of moderation.During the Federal Reserve's second day of meetings, Trump intensified his demands for interest rate cuts, directing criticism at Federal Reserve Chairman Powell whilst dismissing inflation concerns.""We have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed, he probably won't cut today,"" Trump remarked about Powell, making these comments just hours before the Federal Reserve's scheduled announcement.""We have no inflation, we have only success, and I'd like to see interest rates get down,"" he continued whilst speaking at the White House. ""Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself?""Inflation has shown a downward trend since January, and economic experts indicate that without elevated import duties, the Federal Reserve would be implementing further rate reductions.The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of Powell regarding borrowing costs, with Trump directly referring to the Fed chair as a ""numbskull"" for not implementing cuts. Additional administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have joined in advocating for rate reductions.Economists express concern when there is pressure on the Fed to reduce rates solely to decrease government interest payments, as this could compromise the Fed's congressional responsibility to maintain price stability and maximum employment.Trump has expressed dissatisfaction that the Fed maintains rates whilst other global central banks have decreased their borrowing costs, including those in Europe, Canada, and the UK. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan maintained its short-term rate at 0.5%, following a recent increase.The European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England have implemented rate reductions this year partly due to US tariffs affecting their economies. Meanwhile, the US economy remains predominantly robust, with low unemployment levels.","US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

Gold and silver price prediction: Gold and silver price directions will continue to be influenced by global factors - US Federal Reserve’s stance, ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, and US President Donald Trump’s trade policies. Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his outlook on gold and silver prices and the trading strategy for investors:MCX Gold is currently testing a crucial support zone around ₹98,700 per 10 grams, presenting a potential buying opportunity for traders. This level aligns with recent technical analysis, which indicates that the 98,700–98,800 range is a significant support area. A bounce from this zone could propel prices toward the next resistance at ₹1,01,000, with a stop-loss placed below ₹98,000 to manage risk effectively.For those considering a long position, entering near ₹98,700 with a target of ₹1,01,000 offers a favourable risk-to-reward ratio. It's essential to monitor global developments closely, as any escalation in geopolitical tensions could further bolster gold prices.MCX Silver has recently surpassed the ₹109,000 per kilogram mark and is approaching the ₹110,000 level, indicating a continuation of its bullish trend. This upward momentum is supported by a completed bullish pattern on COMEX Silver, where prices have crossed the $37 per ounce threshold, signaling strong investor confidence.Technically, MCX Silver has completed a bullish pattern. This breakout suggests potential further gains, projecting a target of ₹111,900, provided the support at ₹107,500 holds. A failure to maintain this support could lead to a retracement, but the prevailing trend remains positive.Geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, continue to bolster silver's appeal as a safe-haven asset.In summary, with strong technical indicators and supportive macroeconomic factors, MCX Silver presents a favorable trading opportunity. Traders may consider entering positions near ₹107,500, targeting ₹111,900, while placing stop-loss orders below ₹107,000 to manage risk effectively.","Gold and silver price directions will continue to be influenced by global factors.

In a landmark development for India’s clean energy ambitions, five hydrogen fuel cell-based buses were officially flagged off on Thursday for commercial operations in Leh district of Ladakh, home to the world’s highest motorable roads.This is India’s first-ever commercial deployment of hydrogen-powered buses, marking a globally significant leap toward sustainable mobility in extreme terrains.As per news agency PTI, the green hydrogen buses were handed over by NTPC Limited to the State Industrial Development Corporation (SIDCO) in a formal ceremony held at NTPC’s hydrogen mobility station in Palam, Leh.Administrative secretary of the transport department Bhupesh Chaudhary inspected the green hydrogen plant, including its production, storage, and dispensing systems. He commended NTPC’s technological feat in executing this project at high altitude and highlighted its role in achieving a carbon-neutral Ladakh.Chief secretary Pawan Kotwal lauded the “pioneering efforts” of NTPC, stating that the successful operationalisation of hydrogen buses in such extreme terrain “could usher in a new era of hydrogen fuel cell mobility in India.” He also directed the corporation to document all operational learnings for replication across other regions.his initiative is the result of collaborative efforts between NTPC and the Ladakh administration.It stands as a powerful symbol of India’s growing leadership in renewable energy innovation and aligns with the Centre’s broader push toward net-zero emissions.The world’s first hydrogen fuelling station at such a high altitude, 11,562 feet above sea level, was launched by NTPC in November last year. Co-located with a 1.7 MW solar plant, the station operates entirely on renewable power.The project is expected to reduce carbon emissions by around 350 metric tonnes annually and contribute 230 metric tonnes of pure oxygen, equivalent to planting nearly 13,000 trees.NTPC, India’s largest integrated power utility with over 81 GW of installed capacity, has an ambitious plan to reach 60 GW of renewable energy by 2032.With 9.6 GW of green capacity under construction, the hydrogen mobility initiative in Ladakh represents a crucial step in the company's clean energy transition.","Five hydrogen fuel cell-based buses were officially flagged off on Thursday for commercial operations in Leh district of Ladakh.

MUMBAI: The rupee weakened for the third straight session on Thursday, closing at 86.72 against the dollar - down 24 paise.

Forex traders attributed the decline to a mix of sustained dollar demand from importers, weak domestic equities, and geopolitical concerns in West Asia.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, edged higher to 98.92, supported by safe-haven flows. However, gains remained limited as the US Fed chose to keep interest rates unchanged, despite Trump's demand for a steep 250-basis-point cut.","The rupee touched an intraday low of 86.89, its weakest level since mid-March.

Poll Should lawmakers receive increased security measures after such incidents? Yes, absolutely. No, they should manage without.





Minnesota authorities have arrested Vance Boelter, 57, the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, ending an intense two-day manhunt that left the state on edge.The suspect is also accused of wounding State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife Yvette in a separate attack at their Minneapolis suburban home. During both incidents, the assailant reportedly wore a rubber mask and posed as a law enforcement officer.Investigators discovered the suspect had compiled a notebook containing approximately 70 potential targets, including both lawmakers. Before fleeing one of the crime scenes, he allegedly opened fire on responding officers.The manhunt intensified Saturday night when SWAT teams converged on a residence in Plymouth, Minnesota, roughly 12 miles west of Minneapolis. The search expanded to Sibley County the following day, where authorities recovered the suspect's vehicle and hat, approximately an hour's drive from the attack sites.Prior to the shootings, Boelter exhibited suspicious behavior, including emptying his bank account and prepaying four months' rent – at $220 monthly – for a room he occasionally occupied in Minneapolis. The payment was made to David Carlson, who described himself as one of Boelter's closest friends since elementary school.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Minnesota authorities have arrested Vance Boelter, 57, the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark.

"Uttarakhand chopper crash: 5 incidents in 39 days, all linked to Char Dham Yatra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/5-crashes-in-6-weeks-expose-gaps-in-uttarakhands-chopper-safety/articleshow/121867274.cms,"A surge in helicopter accidents, including two fatal ones, has plagued the Kedarnath pilgrimage route in Uttarakhand





DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: Manoj Sharma doesn't fly by the book in the Kedarnath sector — he flies by sight, by wind, by instinct. ""We are flying in one of the world's most unforgiving regions with very little real-time weather support,"" he said. ""Operations in such large numbers are being conducted on pilot observation and visual reference. The weather is very unpredictable and changes very rapidly.""That reality, long known to those in the cockpit, now has the country's attention. In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents — two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage — all on the Kedar route. In one case, a Kestrel Aviation helicopter crash-landed near a road after a mechanical failure, injuring the pilot and damaging a vehicle.This is not an outlier year. In 2022, an Aryan Aviation chopper crashed near Kedarnath, killing seven. In 2023, Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) finance controller Amit Saini died after being struck by a tail rotor. And in 2013, a military rescue helicopter went down during flood relief, killing 20.The terrain is tough — but it is not the only challenge. The system built to manage it is, in many ways, still catching up to the traffic it supports.Pilgrimage flights have surged over the past decade, but the region lacks a dedicated air traffic control network.""There is no ATC control nor any weather station in these areas,"" said a veteran pilot. ""Flying in the narrow valley from Gaurikund to Kedarnath needs a lot of experience and safety awareness, as there are no landing sites on this stretch that can be used in an emergency or bad weather."" Another pilot added, ""There is no information provided on routes where major helicopter operations take place. Till such time these issues can't be addressed, these operations should immediately be stopped. ""This month, the civil aviation ministry suspended Aryan Aviation from Char Dham operations and grounded two TransBharat pilots who flew in unsuitable weather, suspending their licences for six months.UCADA — established by the state in 2013 to oversee civil aviation development and safety, including helipad infrastructure and coordination with private operators — has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review with all operators and setting up a command-and-control room to monitor real-time risks. DGCA has deployed officers to oversee safety, airworthiness and the functioning of the control centre.But many in the sector say these moves fall short. ""It seems there are no checks and balances in place,"" said one chopper operator. ""There is someone who replaced one inoperative part on a chopper with another inoperative part from another chopper to show that the part has been changed. Because of unscrupulous operators, conscientious operators and passengers are suffering.""Others point to a deeper culture of pressure and compromise. ""There have been five chopper crashes in the country within the last 1.5 months, which is the worst we have ever seen in helicopter operations in our country,"" said a senior pilot. ""Char Dham operations are one of the toughest... yet we still fly as if nothing needs fixing.""Another pilot was more direct: ""We need a complete stop on chopper operations for this yatra season. All stakeholders — owners, pilots, commercial, engineers, DGCA and UCADA — need to look within and change."" One added, simply, ""It's greed. That's what's driving this. Not safety.""","In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents. Two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage.

Gold and crypto winning the game

Ever since US President Donald Trump took office, five months ago, his economic policies have unleashed widespread volatility across global financial markets, triggering investor pullback, a weakening dollar, and a sharp divergence in global stock performance.Here is a look at the financial roller-coaster rise:After years of dominating global markets, US stocks are now lagging behind — with Europe reaping the gains.Since the start of the year, Wall Street’s S&P 500 index has risen just two percent, while Frankfurt’s main index has surged 16 percent. London and Paris have also outperformed, recording gains of eight and three percent respectively.Kevin Thozet of investment firm Carmignac attributed the underperformance to President Trump’s inconsistent stance on tariffs.Thozet told AFP that the president’s shifting stance on tariffs had fuelled significant uncertainty around how they might affect economic growth.The US dollar has shed 10 percent of its value against the euro over the past six months, its steepest decline in three decades, according to Robert Farago, analyst at British investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.While President Trump’s tariff policies are seen as the primary driver, mounting concerns over the ballooning US debt, amplified by a costly presidential budget proposal, have further weighed on the currency.Though some have floated the idea of the Chinese yuan as a possible alternative to the dollar, ECB President Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the euro’s potential for a stronger international role.Still, significant hurdles remain for any currency seeking to challenge the dollar’s dominance.American debt has long been seen as a bedrock of the global financial system, with investors worldwide turning to US Treasury bonds as a safe haven.But that confidence is starting to crack. JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon recently warned that the ballooning US debt is a ""real problem"" and that bond markets are entering a ""tough time.""At the end of May, yields on 30-year US Treasury bonds crossed the key five percent threshold—an indication of waning faith in America's ability to manage its debt.""I've always told clients they need US debt if they want an asset that remains intact even in a disaster, but I think that's no longer the case,"" said Alexandre Hezez, strategist at Banque Richelieu.Adding to the concern, Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers noted that the dollar is weakening even as interest rates rise, ""a sign that money is leaving the US.""Donald Trump made lowering oil prices a key priority in his efforts to curb US inflation.In April, crude prices dipped below $60 a barrel, their lowest level since 2021. However, this drop was driven less by policy success and more by market fears. Investors, rattled by Trump’s tariff moves, anticipated a global economic slowdown that would weaken demand.More recently, rising tensions in the Middle East have pushed prices back up. The military escalation between Israel and Iran has driven oil back to around $75 a barrel.Gold has traditionally been seen as the ultimate safe haven during times of uncertainty and 2025 has been no different. Soaring demand has pushed its value up by nearly 30 percent since the start of the year.Much of this rally has been fuelled by major central banks, which are increasingly turning to gold over the US dollar to shore up their reserves.At the same time, Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind cryptocurrencies. Alongside his personal investments, his administration has introduced measures to integrate digital assets more firmly into the financial system.Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark for the first time shortly after the US election, capping off a nearly 60 percent gain over the past year.","Since the start of the year, Wall Street’s S&P 500 index has risen just two percent, while Frankfurt’S main index has surged 16 percent. London and Paris have also outperformed, recording gains of eight and three percent respectively.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121959686,imgsize-2650725,width-400,resizemode-4/121959686.jpg"
Global FDI decline: UN warns of declining globalisation; 'Barriers are rising',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-fdi-decline-un-warns-of-declining-globalisation-barriers-are-rising/articleshow/121958419.cms,"FDI

United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Thursday expressed concern over the declining state of globalisation, warning that foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to shrink amid worsening global economic conditions.His remarks came as the UN released fresh data highlighting a negative outlook for international investment flows.In its 2025 World Investment Report, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) revealed that global FDI dropped by 11 per cent last year, once adjusted for volatile financial flows through several European economies, falling to $1.5 trillion. The downturn follows two consecutive years of decline and is expected to continue into 2025, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions and tariff disputes.“At a time when the world should be deepening cooperation and expanding opportunity, we are seeing the opposite,” Guterres said.“Barriers are rising. Globalisation is retreating. And the consequences for sustainable development are profound. Rising trade tensions, policy uncertainty and geopolitical divisions risk making the investment environment even worse.,” he further added.UNCTAD attributed the global slide to a 22 per cent fall in FDI to developed economies, with Europe taking the hardest hit, recording a staggering 58 per cent decline.The United States, however, saw a 23 per cent increase, helping North America stand out as an exception.In contrast, FDI inflows to developing countries remained relatively stable, though the broader investment outlook remains fragile.Presenting the findings at a press conference, UNCTAD secretary-general Rebeca Grynspan called the situation “clear and urgent,” warning that global investment remains “weak” and the prospects for this year are “negative.”“The investment landscape in 2024 was shaped by international tensions, trade fragmentation, and intensifying industrial policy competition,” she said. These factors are “eroding long-term investor confidence.”Although trade showed early signs of recovery in 2023 after the pandemic years, Grynspan said that renewed uncertainty—particularly stemming from the renewed trade war initiated by former US President Donald Trump in April—has “killed that possibility for 2025.”“The problem that we have is that we don't see an end,” she added.The findings come at a time when global economic cooperation appears increasingly strained, with the ripple effects of protectionist policies threatening to undermine progress toward sustainable development goals.","Global FDI dropped by 11 per cent last year, once adjusted for volatile financial flows through several European economies.

US President Donald Trump once again slammed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, accusing him of costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars after the central bank kept the interest rates unchanged. ""Too Late,"" Trump tweeted, calling Powell one of the ""dumbest"" and most ""destructive"" people in government.""Too Late"" Jerome Powell is costing our Country hundreds of billions of dollars. He is truly one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government, and the Fed Board is complicit,"" Trump posted on Truth social.Trump expressed frustration after the Fed chose to keep interest rates unchanged, despite European countries implementing multiple rate cuts. He argued that the US should have already reduced rates by 2.5 points to save billions on short-term debt, highlighting the country’s low inflation as justification for the cuts.""Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had none. We should be 2.5 Points lower, and save $BILLIONS on all of Biden’s Short Term Debt. We have LOW inflation! TOO LATE’s an American Disgrace!"" Trump noted.He had earlier called Powell a “real dummy” and claimed he was ""costing America billions.""Trump also shared an article in which an investor argued Powell should resign immediately if he failed to cut short-term interest rates, saying the Fed’s slow actions were hurting the housing market and that inflation had dropped enough to justify a rate cut.The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting, sticking with a range between 4.25% and 4.50%.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was in no rush to act and would monitor inflation trends and the impact of Trump's new tariffs over the summer. “We'll make smarter and better decisions if we just wait a couple of months,” Powell said, suggesting a cautious stance given the mixed economic signals.The Fed also revised its outlook—cutting its 2025 growth forecast from 1.7% to 1.4%, and raising inflation expectations to 3% and the unemployment rate to 4.5%.From “stupid” to “worst ever.”Trump's criticism of Powell is not new. In the past, Trump has publicly attacked the Fed chairman, including calling him “stupid” just before the rates were announced.Trump has suggested that cutting rates will lower the interest America pays on its debt—an argument critics say overlooks the inflationary risks of such moves.The Fed noted that Trump’s sweeping 10% tariffs on major trading partners were likely to increase inflation and slow growth.Powell added that the full effects were still unclear and may not be visible for several months. ""Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,"" he said.",The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting.

Global oil supply: Iran may use threat of closing Strait of Hormuz as leverage only; analysts say markets remain in surplus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-oil-supply-iran-may-use-threat-of-closing-strait-of-hormuz-as-leverage-only-analysts-say-markets-remain-in-surplus/articleshow/121957332.cms,"Representative image

Iran has repeatedly warned of blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow yet strategically crucial maritime chokepoint for global oil supply, however, the country has not yet shut it down.Analysts say that the vital passage has never been shut down and Iran is using this threat as a diplomatic lever and that the chances of an actual shutdown are slim. Additionally, global oil markets are also well prepared to absorb any geopolitical shock from the region.""Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz numerous times in the past but has never followed through, as doing so would be strategically and economically self-defeating,"" said Hitesh Jain, strategist for institutional equities research at Yes Securities.The Strait, which lies between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula, is the main passage for oil exports from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. It also serves as a key route for liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments from Qatar. Roughly 20% or one fifth of global oil and a significant share of global LNG passes through this narrow waterway. Over a third of India’s energy needs also travel through the passage.Jain noted that oil markets remain well-supplied, pointing to OPEC’s spare capacity of 4 million barrels per day and a pre-conflict global surplus of 0.9 million bpd as key buffers.The growing strength of US shale production, he added, further boosted the market’s resilience.Rating agency ICRA echoed the sentiment but added a note of caution, suggesting that crude prices may average to $70-80 per barrel for the current fiscal year.“A sustained flare-up in the conflict poses upside risks for our estimates of crude oil prices, and consequently of net oil imports and the current account deficit (CAD). A $10 per barrel increase in the average price of crude oil for the fiscal will typically push up net oil imports by $13-14 billion during the year, enlarging the CAD by 0.3 per cent of GDP.”India is heavily reliant on imported energy, with over 85% of its crude oil and around half of its natural gas needs coming from abroad, PTI reported.Imports from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, most of which pass through the Strait, account for 40–45% of India’s oil supply. Roughly 60% of its LNG imports also transit through the same channel.Jain added that the global energy landscape has evolved significantly. Since 2008, the rise of US shale has enhanced global supply and flexibility, allowing markets to absorb geopolitical shocks with only short-lived price spikes. Meanwhile, OPEC’s reduced market share and increased spare capacity, largely from Saudi Arabia and the UAE—have helped keep volatility in check.On the demand side, China’s weak post-COVID recovery and the global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), improved fuel efficiency, and greener policies are slowing oil demand in OECD countries. “Given this backdrop, Brent crude is unlikely to sustain levels above $80 per barrel in a durable way unless the Strait of Hormuz is closed, or critical Gulf infrastructure is targeted,” Jain noted.The International Energy Agency (IEA) and US Energy Information Administration (EIA) have both trimmed their 2025 global oil demand growth forecastsby 0.2-0.28 million barrels per day.Still, ICRA cautioned that regional risks remain. Iran currently produces about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil per day, of which 1.8–2.0 million bpd is exported. “While Iranian oil and gas facilities have reportedly been attacked, the extent of damage is not clear. However, any disruption of Iranian production and supplies or a wider regional conflict impacting other large producers in the region could push energy prices higher. ”“At these elevated crude oil prices, while the profitability of upstream players will remain healthy and their capex plans will remain intact, the marketing margins of downstream players will be impacted along with the expansion of LPG under-recoveries” the rating agency added.","Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz numerous times in the past but has never followed through.

The firm suggested the hackers had “effectively burned the funds in order to send Nobitex a political message,” rather than profiting from the theft.The group also accused Nobitex of helping Iran’s government circumvent Western sanctions and funnel money to militant groups, including Hamas and Yemen's Houthis. In a statement posted on X, Predatory Sparrow claimed the platform had played a role in supporting Tehran’s nuclear programme and militant proxies.Nobitex appeared to confirm the breach, saying it was investigating “unauthorised access” to its systems. Its website and app remained offline on Tuesday.Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, described the hack as “particularly significant given the comparatively modest size of Iran’s cryptocurrency market.”The cyberattack follows a fresh wave of escalations between Israel and Iran, sparked last week when Israeli forces reportedly struck nuclear and military targets in Iran, triggering retaliatory missile attacks. The hack also came just days after Predatory Sparrow claimed to have wiped data from Bank Sepah, a major Iranian state-run lender.Elliptic further alleged that associates of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had ties to the Nobitex platform, and that sanctioned Revolutionary Guard operatives used it for financial transactions.While Israeli outlets have repeatedly linked Predatory Sparrow to Israel’s intelligence services, the Israeli government has never officially acknowledged any connection.Last year, US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King voiced concerns over Iran’s use of cryptocurrencies as a tool to bypass international sanctions.","Hackers with suspected links to Israel have stolen over $90 million from Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

NEW DELHI: Russia’s economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov made a rare admission on Thursday, warning that the country’s economy is “on the brink of going into a recession”, even as top Kremlin officials attempted to project calm at the nation’s most prominent economic summit, according to Russian media reports.Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, a high-profile event intended to showcase Russia’s economic strength and attract global investors, Reshetnikov cautioned that current data signals a worrying slowdown.“The numbers indicate cooling, but all our numbers are (like) a rearview mirror,” Reshetnikov was quoted as saying by Russian business outlet RBC. “Judging by the way businesses currently feel and the indicators, we are already, it seems to me, on the brink of going into a recession.”The comments come amid mounting pressure on Russia’s war-fueled economy, which has defied earlier predictions of collapse under Western sanctions. High military spending has kept growth alive and unemployment low, even as inflation surges. Wage hikes and recruitment bonuses for soldiers, along with death payouts, have injected cash into poorer regions, keeping demand steady.Still, economists warn that Russia’s militarized economy is dangerously unbalanced.With foreign investment drying up and growth largely confined to defense sectors, the risk of long-term stagnation looms large.Reshetnikov was blunt: “Going forward, it all depends on our decisions.”But other officials at the forum struck a more optimistic tone. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov admitted the economy was “cooling,” but brushed off concerns by saying, “After any cooling, the summer always comes.” Meanwhile, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina insisted the economy was simply “coming out of overheating.”",Russia’s economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov made a rare admission on Thursday.

"‘Fundamentally well supplied..’: Brent crude prices expected to average $70 in FY26 despite Israel-Iran conflict, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fundamentally-well-supplied-brent-crude-prices-expected-to-average-70-in-fy26-despite-israel-iran-conflict-says-report/articleshow/121949211.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

Brent crude oil prices are projected to average around $70 per barrel in FY26 despite geopolitical turbulence in the Middle East, according to a report by Emkay Research.The agency said oil markets remain “fundamentally well supplied,” citing rising output from both OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers as key factors stabilising prices.“We continue to assume Brent price at USD70/bbl for FY26. Fundamentally, oil markets are well supplied with rising production,” the report said. This outlook comes despite a recent spike in prices caused by Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, which triggered a sharp 12–13 per cent surge in Brent to nearly $80 per barrel.Prices have since moderated to around $75 per barrel, even as tensions remain high. Iran retaliated with missile attacks on Israeli cities, while Israel has ramped up its operations. Yet, according to Emkay, unless key energy infrastructure suffers sustained damage, as witnessed during the Russia-Ukraine war, markets are likely to remain stable.As per the news agency ANI, the report further noted that a ceasefire could potentially drive Brent prices even lower, possibly below the $70 threshold.“The market is well buffered by existing inventory levels,” Emkay noted, adding that a steady supply outlook would help limit long-term inflationary pressure.The report also flagged limited but notable disruptions. Iran has partially shut its South Pars gas field following Israeli airstrikes. While domestic supplies have been impacted, the wider global market response has been restrained. In contrast, Israel suspended operations at two of its gas fields supplying Egypt and Jordan.Spot LNG prices have climbed to $13.5/mmbtu, up from $12 before the conflict began.As per news agency PTI, while Iran exports up to 2 million barrels per day, about 2 per cent of global supply, its long-standing sanctions mean much of that oil is already being sold at a discount to buyers like China.Additionally, OPEC’s spare capacity remains unusually high, with over 4 million barrels per day in reserve, primarily from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The IEA also maintains over 1.2 billion barrels in strategic reserves across OECD nations.Despite the Middle East tensions, demand remains tepid. China's industrial slowdown and its reduced refinery output in May, down 1.8 per cent year-on-year, have softened consumption. The IEA also predicts global supply in 2025 will surpass demand by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day, leaving room for further price cushioning.On the corporate front, Emkay believes that while both upstream producers and oil marketing companies (OMCs) remain within a “safe zone” at current price levels, OMCs offer more attractive valuations and better risk-reward potential.However, the gas market could face pressure. The early onset of monsoons in South Asia has already reduced demand, and Emkay warns of continued volatility in the sector.Globally, the risks of escalation remain real. If Iran decides to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, through which nearly 20 million barrels of oil transit daily, global prices could surge. While alternate pipelines through Saudi Arabia and the UAE exist, insurance and freight costs have already jumped nearly 60 per cent since hostilities began.","Brent crude oil prices are projected to average around $70 per barrel in FY26.

Fed hits pause again

From “stupid” to “worst ever”

Tariffs, inflation, and global uncertainty

US president slammed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday after the central bank once again decided not to cut interest rates. The president in his Truth Social post, called Powell a ""real dummy"" who was ""costing America billions. ""He also shared an article highlighting criticism from an investor who said Powell should resign ""effective immediately"" if he didn't reduce short-term interest rates. It argued the Fed was hurting the housing market by acting too slowly and that inflation had fallen enough to justify a cut.The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting, sticking with a range between 4.25% and 4.50%.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was in no rush to act and would monitor inflation trends and the impact of Trump's new tariffs over the summer. “We'll make smarter and better decisions if we just wait a couple of months,” Powell said, suggesting a cautious stance given the mixed economic signals.The Fed also revised its outlook—cutting its 2025 growth forecast from 1.7% to 1.4%, and raising inflation expectations to 3% and the unemployment rate to 4.5%.Trump's criticism of Powell is not new. In the past, he has publicly attacked the Fed chairman, including calling him “stupid” just before the rates were announced.Last week, Trump posted, ""Fed should lower one full point… so important!"" in response to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data he described as positive.Trump has suggested that cutting rates will lower the interest America pays on its debt—an argument critics say overlooks the inflationary risks of such moves.The Fed noted that Trump’s sweeping 10% tariffs on major trading partners were likely to increase inflation and slow growth. Powell admitted that the full effects were still unclear and may not be visible for several months. “Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,” he said.","The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting, sticking with a range between 4.25% and 4.50%.

Wall Street Journal

Asian markets dropped on Thursday amid heightened geopolitical tensions and fresh warnings from the US Federal Reserve about rising inflation linked to US President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war.Investor sentiment was also rattled by uncertainty over whether the US would join Israel’s ongoing airstrikes against Iran.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell more than 1 per cent, Tokyo's Nikkei shed 0.7 per cent, and Shanghai's Composite Index lost 0.3 per cent in early trade. Other markets across Asia, including Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, and Jakarta, also opened in the red.The declines followed the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged for a fourth consecutive time. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the US economy remained “solid,” he warned that “increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.”In its updated projections, the Fed revised its growth outlook downwards while raising expectations for inflation and unemployment.“Ultimately, the cost of the tariff has to be paid and some of it will fall on the end consumer,” Powell said, adding that the bank would “wait to learn more” before making further moves.Meanwhile, Trump again lashed out at the central bank ahead of the rate decision, saying, “We have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed,” and questioned whether he could appoint himself to lead the institution. Speaking at the White House, he insisted, “We have no inflation, we have only success.”According to news agency Reuters, the yen and gold, traditional safe havens, saw gains as market participants grew wary over Trump’s ambiguous stance on military action. “I may do it. I may not do it,” Trump said when asked whether the US would join Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.According to the, Trump had approved military plans but was waiting to see if Iran might back off its nuclear ambitions.In response, gold rose 0.3 per cent to $3,378 per ounce, and the yen appreciated 0.2 per cent to 144.92 against the dollar. The US dollar itself also gained, with the euro dipping to $1.1455, and sterling down to $1.3396.Oil prices edged slightly lower despite volatile trading. Brent crude fell 0.4 per cent to $76.40 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate also dropped 0.4 per cent to $74.86. Still, prices remain close to multi-month highs due to fears that Iran could disrupt shipments through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital corridor for global oil supply. “We don’t see it as a likely scenario at this time,” said Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute to Bloomberg, “but everybody should be watching. ”According to JP Morgan Asset Management’s Tai Hui, the Fed’s outlook matches current data but ongoing uncertainty over trade and US foreign policy will continue to drive market volatility. “Trade policy, fiscal policy, and unintended consequences of policies from the Trump administration are contributing to market volatility in the second half of this year,” Hui noted.Elsewhere, S&P 500 futures pointed 0.4 per cent lower, while US markets remained closed for a national holiday.While regional central banks, including the Bank of England and Swiss National Bank, are due to issue policy decisions later today, investor focus remains fixed on Trump’s next move, both on interest rates and in the Middle East. As Trump teased to reporters, “The next week is going to be very big.”","Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell more than 1 per cent, Tokyo's Nikkei shed 0.7 per cent.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

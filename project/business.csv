Stock market recommendations:PNB has transitioned from a legacy-stressed balance sheet to a fundamentally stronger franchise, with asset quality concerns decisively addressed. The steady reduction in GNPA (3.78%) and NNPA (0.38%), coupled with robust PCR (90.3%), underpins earnings predictability. PNB reiterated its FY26 loan growth guidance of 11–12%, with management noting strong momentum in the Retail and MSME segments (+18% YoY).MSME growth is driven by cash-flow-based lending and digital initiatives, with NPAs remaining well-controlled at around 1%. At current valuations, PNB is trading at a discount compared to both private-sector peers and select public sector banks, providing a margin of safety.We expect PNB to maintain a stable RoA of 1% in FY27/28. Additionally, we project PNB to achieve a 12.8% CAGR in its loan book from FY25 to FY28.L&T secures 2 Large orders (₹2,500–5,000 cr) for STATCOM, SCADA, and Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project, reflecting strong execution in grid stability and high-speed rail — key themes in India’s infra push. L&T bags another significant order (₹1,000–2,500 cr) from NPCIL for nuclear civil works, reaffirming the company's dominant positioning in critical infrastructure and long-cycle government capex projects.L&T’s expansion in renewable and transmission projects across the GCC region diversifies revenue streams, tapping into high-growth clean energy markets and improving long-term margin and earnings stability. We expect LT to report a CAGR of 20% in PAT over FY25-28.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting September 22, 2025) are Punjab National Bank, and Larsen & Toubro.

Gold prices are expected to maintain their bullish trend, and a buy on dips strategy may work well for investors, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd.

Here is his outlook for gold prices in the coming days:

Profit booking could be witnessed as we hover near all-time highs, however buy on dips can be maintained for Gold this week.

Till prices are above Rs 1,08,500, any dip could be used as an buying opportunity for new all times, targeting Rs 1,11,000 - Rs 1,12,000.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price prediction today:Gold started last week with some profit booking after scaling record highs but losses were limited amid weak US jobs data, rupee depreciation and expectations of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Market sentiment was influenced by higher-than-expected inflation data, softer labor market numbers, and a sharp drop in non-farm payrolls, leading participants to price in at least a 25 bps cut, with some even anticipating a 50 bps move.The Fed meeting came against a complex backdrop of political tussles, including legal challenges around its leadership and President Trump’s push for a deeper rate cut, highlighting risks to the central bank’s independence. On the geopolitical front, Middle East tensions, NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe, and Israel’s military escalation in Gaza added a risk premium, further supporting safe-haven demand.While US retail sales and industrial production surprised on the upside, concerns linger over slowing labor markets, tariff-driven price pressures, and global trade uncertainty. Fed eventually delivered a 25 bps rate cut, labelling it a “risk-management cut,” while also raising GDP forecasts and keeping inflation risks in focus.Although US yields and the dollar initially slipped, both rebounded after Powell’s cautious tone, which signaled further cuts in 2025 but caution beyond. Gold briefly retreated nearly 1% post-policy but continues to hover close to historic peaks as investors weigh Fed guidance and geopolitical risks.Even after the much awaited Fed meeting, market participants are awaiting some clarity as Fed Chair’s comments and forecasts have kept the market on edge. Along with the monetary policy path, Geo-political development and President Trump’s attempt for MAGA is also creating uncertainties and supporting bullion.The recent announcement from the Trump administration to increase fees of H-1B visas could also increase unrest and create an issue for immigrants. This week a slew of Fed officials are expected to make an appearance including Governor Powell which could give us more clarity on last week’s decision. Focus now also shifts to Preliminary PMI data from major economies, US GDP, inflation and durable goods orders data.","Gold prices are expected to maintain their bullish trend, and a buy on dips strategy may work well for investors.

"Ahmedabad plane crash: Air India victims' kin sue Boeing, Honeywell; blame fuel cutoff switches that FAA cleared as 'safe'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ahmedabad-plane-crash-air-india-victims-kin-sue-boeing-honeywell-blame-fuel-cutoff-switches-that-faa-cleared-as-safe/articleshow/123969824.cms,"'Truth Will Prevail': Aviation Minister Shuts Concerns Over Air India Crash Probe Report Findings

What did the preliminary investigation reveal?

What the maintenance records reveal?



What are fuel control switches?







The families of four victims of the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI171 have filed a lawsuit against US planemaker Boeing and aerospace supplier Honeywell, alleging that faulty cockpit fuel switches caused the deadly accident that killed 260 people.The complaint, lodged in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, claims the accident occurred seconds after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner took off from Ahmedabad for London due to a defective design of the aircraft’s fuel cutoff switches.Honeywell manufactured the switches, which were approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). While the FAA has said the switches themselves do not appear to have caused the crash, the lawsuit contends that their design and placement made them prone to accidental activation.The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the families of Kantaben Dhirubhai Paghadal, Naavya Chirag Paghadal, Kuberbhai Patel, and Babiben Patel—among the victims who perished in the crash, Reuters reported.According to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the Dreamliner took off normally before both of its engines lost power.A cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other, “Why did you shut off the fuel?” to which the co-pilot responded, “I did not.”Investigators found that the fuel switches had been flipped to “CUTOFF,” cutting power to both engines. Though the crew reset them to “RUN” within 14 seconds, triggering an automatic engine relight—the aircraft had already lost critical thrust.The plane entered a steep descent, crashing into a nearby building just 32 seconds after takeoff. CCTV footage confirmed the deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT), a backup power source used during complete engine failure. The AAIB report also ruled out bird strikes, noting no evidence of avian activity in the area.Of the 229 passengers, 12 crew members, and people on the ground, only one passenger survived.The preliminary investigation indicated that Air India had not carried out all suggested inspections for the aircraft model. Maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module, which houses the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the ill-fated plane.However, the AAIB noted that “all applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied with on the aircraft as well as engines,” suggesting regulatory requirements had been met.Despite this, the lawsuit argues that the switches’ location just below the thrust levers “effectively guaranteed that normal cockpit activity could result in inadvertent fuel cutoff.”Aviation safety experts, however, told Reuters that the switches’ design makes accidental activation highly unlikely.Legal analysts note that while most aviation accidents result from multiple factors, lawsuits against manufacturers are common because airlines enjoy liability caps that aircraft makers do not, according to Reuters.Fuel control switches regulate the flow of fuel to an aircraft’s engines. They are essential during engine start-up, shutdown, and in-flight emergencies. On the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, the switches are placed below the thrust levers.If moved to “CUTOFF,” the switches immediately cut power to the engines. Aviation engineers stress they are designed to resist accidental activation.However, once flipped, their impact is immediate, leaving little room for recovery, as tragically demonstrated in the Air India crash.",The families of four victims of the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI171 have filed a lawsuit against US planemaker Boeing and aerospace supplier Honeywell. The complaint claims the accident occurred seconds after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner took off from Ahmedabad for London due to a defective design of the aircraft's fuel cutoff switches.

India’s first large private gold mine at Jonnagiri in Andhra Pradesh is poised to begin full-scale production shortly, Deccan Gold Mines Ltd (DGML) Managing Director Hanuma Prasad said on Thursday.The project, developed by Geomysore Services India Ltd in which DGML holds a stake, has received environmental clearance in June and July, while state approvals are also being sought.“The project stabilisation is going on... it is only the technology of the plant which is being worked out... full-scale production will begin very soon,” Prasad told PTI on the sidelines of the CII India Mining Summit 2025.Once stabilised, the Jonnagiri mine is expected to produce 750 kg of gold annually, scaling up to 1,000 kg within two to three years. “India’s production of gold as of today is 1.5 tonnes... once our mine starts, nearly one more tonne will be added,” Prasad said.India imports nearly 1,000 tonnes of gold every year, making it the country’s second-largest import after oil. The Jonnagiri project is located in Kurnool district, across Jonnagiri, Erragudi and Pagadirayi villages.Founded in 2003, DGML is India’s only listed gold exploration company with assets across the Indian peninsula, Kyrgyzstan, Finland and Tanzania.","India’s first large private gold mine at Jonnagiri in Andhra Pradesh is poised to begin full-scale production shortly.

Asian markets opened cautiously higher on Monday, while the dollar held steady as investors assessed the US monetary policy outlook after last week’s Federal Reserve rate cut. Adding to the unease, President Donald Trump's crackdown on worker visas kept sentiment in check, particularly for India's tech sector.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.09%, while Tokyo's Nikkei gained 1% after Friday’s drop. US stock futures, however, slipped, with S&P futures down 0.1%, Reuters reported.The focus remains on Indian IT stocks after Washington announced that companies would need to pay $100,000 annually for new H-1B visas, a major setback for the $283 billion Indian IT industry, which earns more than half of its revenue from the US.The visa move comes on the heels of Trump doubling tariffs on Indian imports to as much as 50%, citing New Delhi's Russian oil purchases.According to Reuters, on the macroeconomic front, traders are closely watching the Fed’s rate path after last week’s cut, with more policymakers set to speak this week.Friday's core PCE inflation data, the Fed's preferred gauge, will also be key, with expectations of a 0.2% monthly rise keeping the annual rate at 2.9%.Markets are pricing in around 44 basis points of easing by year-end.The dollar index stood at 97.716, holding its ground. Analysts noted that US Treasury supply and a heavy Fed speaker calendar could drive currency moves in the near term.The Japanese yen weakened slightly to 148.20 per dollar after the Bank of Japan held rates at 0.5%. Two board members pushed unsuccessfully for a hike to 0.75%, signaling a hawkish tilt.In commodities, Brent crude inched up 0.3% to $66.89 a barrel, while US WTI rose 0.35% to $62.90.Gold gained 0.24% to $3,692.79 per ounce, just shy of last week's record high.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.09%.

MUMBAI: The ownership dispute between Bharat Forge chairman and MD Baba Kalyani and his sister and Hikal non-executive director Sugandha Hiremath over the chemicals company has escalated. Baba's son Amit Kalyani is seeking re-election as a non-executive and non-independent director at Hikal. His reappointment, under an ordinary resolution, requires a majority of votes to be cast in his favour. Amit (50) has been on Hikal's board for 13 years.Sugandha and her family, who own about 35% of Hikal, are expected to vote against her nephew's reappointment. In Dec 2023, Baba exited the board after failing to secure required shareholder votes, ending a 31-year tenure at the chemicals company. Sugandha and her family had voted against Baba's reappointment at that time. The remote e-voting on Amit's reappointment will conclude on Monday. The results will be declared on Tuesday after the AGM e-voting closes that evening.Baba and his family own 34% of Hikal and are expected to back his son's reappointment. The remaining 31% is held by non-promoters. It will be interesting to see the stance taken by institutional and retail investors on Amit's directorship.In Sept 2024, Sugandha's board reappointment was approved with the backing of institutional and retail shareholders, despite Baba and his family voting against it.Shareholder advisory firms have taken different positions on Amit's reappointment - SES recommended voting in favour of his reappointment, while IIAS advised against it.""We note that the promoters (Hiremath and Kalyani factions) are involved in a dispute regarding Hikal's ownership. We expect them to relinquish their board positions, resolve the ownership dispute and then seek (re)appointments to the board again so as not to impact the overall functioning and decision making...and to shield the larger shareholder interest from a prolonged promoter dispute,"" said IIAS.In July, Amit resigned as an independent director on Schaeffler India's board, citing ""other professional commitments."" Apart from Hikal, Amit serves on the boards of Bharat Forge, Kalyani Steels and three other companies.""So far, we have been raising concerns about Amit's excessive time commitments...but he now holds six listed directorships. Although these six positions may seem stretched, since they are all within the common promoter group, we do not have any major concerns regarding the time commitments,"" said SES.Hikal was established by Sugandha's husband Jaidev Hiremath with seed capital from her and Baba's father for a manufacturing facility in Maharashtra. In return, Hikal shares were issued to Surajmukhi - an entity owned by their father - with the understanding that the shares would be transferred back to the Hiremaths. According to Sugandha, Baba did not fulfill his obligation under the family arrangement to transfer his 34% in Hikal to her.

MUMBAI: The new GST regime will make products more affordable for consumers, boosting consumption, said T Krishnakumar, director at Reliance Consumer Products (RCPL) which has started production of new packs with a target to roll them out in the market by the end of the month. ""In India, one of the biggest barriers to consumption is affordability. GST reform is a move in the right direction, and it will benefit consumption growth, without a doubt,"" Krishnakumar told TOI in an exclusive interview ahead of the implementation of the new tax rates. The rejigged tax slabs come into effect from Monday with the onset of Navratri.About 65%-70% of RCPL's portfolio which includes food, beverages, confectionary and personal care will get covered under the new GST rates. The company, which competes with global giants such as Unilever, Nestle, Pepsico and a host of homegrown players including Dabur and ITC in the market has cut prices across its brands ranging from Maliban cookies, Masti Oye! snacks and Glimmer soaps.For now, it is also slashing prices of small packs given that grammage addition takes time (weight increase may happen in new packs). ""Small packs outnumber large packs for us by a substantial margin in all categories except staples,"" Krishnakumar said, adding that the frequent notifications issued by the govt this time has eased the process of transitioning to the new regime for businesses.RCPL, he said, didn't face any major issues with inventory management. ""Our stocks tend to last only for 10-12 days on retail shelves, so it hasn't been much of an issue,"" Krishnakumar said. For RCPL which launched operations in Nov 2022, the geographical reach is still not as expansive as older incumbents.RCPL, which is set to be a direct subsidiary of Reliance Industries recorded revenues of $1.4 billion (over Rs 11,000 crore) in FY25. A large part of the growth for the business which has expanded its coverage of FMCG has come on the back of acquisitions and joint venture partnerships, a strategy which Krishnakumar said will continue alongside building own brands.The firm has charted a plan to become a national player (across product segments) in three years. ""We have started expanding geographies. Our branded staples and beverages portfolio will become fully national by March 2026. We will keep expanding in other categories and in three years' time, we will be a national player across segments. We are just about entering the general merchandise category (brooms, washing kits etc) and this too will be scaled nationally in three years,"" Krishnakumar said.RCPL's acquisition strategy has largely been focused around buying old, struggling heritage Indian brands and reviving their growth.","Reliance Consumer Products (RCPL) has started production of new packs with a target to roll them out in the market by the end of the month.

Lens on small-ticket personal loan defaults: RBI to look at use of device locking tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lens-on-small-ticket-personal-loan-defaults-rbi-to-look-at-use-of-device-locking-tech/articleshow/124033415.cms,"



MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: RBI is considering a proposal to regulate the use of device locking technology in case of continued default for some small-ticket personal loans - but with explicit safeguards. Sources said a final decision on the issue has not been taken, but the needs of consumers and lenders have to be balanced.In some of the loans used for purchase of things like smartphones, lenders are remotely disabling devices and locking the users from using the phones to recover their dues. While several low-ticket loans are now available to segments of the population that were earlier considered 'unbankable', there need to be adequate guardrails to ensure borrowers are not harassed, said a source.There is recognition that unbridled use of practices such as digital locking technology poses risks to borrowers, which impacts access to their personal data - including contacts, documents, work-related applications e-wallets, and educational material for children. For gig workers or small entrepreneurs, this may also mean losing access to navigation tools, client information and delivery platforms, hitting their ability to earn and repay.""Unlike traditional collaterals, where repossession is tangible and regulated, this digital form of control can be more intrusive and difficult for borrowers to anticipate or challenge,"" said a banking source.Besides, there is no redressal mechanism of wrongful locking of devices, which leaves the borrower completely at the mercy of the lender. Also, given access to such techniques, it is feared that lenders may not be adequately assessing the repayment capacity of the borrowers.As a result, there is growing recognition that if allowed under regulations, device locking should be accompanied by a clear and informed consent. There is also a need to provide sufficient notice after default before a phone is locked or restrictions are imposed, which should ideally be in a graded manner. Further, it should be ensured that there is no breach of data privacy.RBI's latest guidelines on digital lending released in May 2025 says that digital lending apps (DLAs) and lending service providers (LSPs) can collect only need-based data with prior, explicit borrower consent and an audit trail. They cannot access phone resources such as files, contacts, or call logs, and can use device features like camera, mic, or location only once for KYC with consent. Borrowers must retain full control over their data, including the right to deny, revoke, or limit consent, and to demand deletion. No biometric data can be collected unless legally permitted, and any third-party sharing requires explicit consent unless mandated by law.","RBI is considering a proposal to regulate the use of device locking technology in case of continued default for some small-ticket personal loans.

That picture has changed dramatically. ""As value growth in the FMCG sector returned in 2024-25, with rural markets even outpacing urban growth, newer categories like millets benefited from increased consumer willingness to try better-for-you alternatives.

What is the penalty for filing a belated return?



Can I claim a refund in a belated return?



How to file ITR after the due date?





Can a belated return be revised?







The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.The extension applies to those not required to undergo an income tax audit. This deadline has not been extended further.So, what happens if one misses the deadline?Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, but it may attract penalties and other consequences.Any ITR filed after the due date is considered a belated return and can be submitted until December 31, 2025. While filing a belated ITR allows taxpayers to comply with the law, it comes with certain limitations, including late fees and other potential consequences.Tax experts advise taxpayers to act promptly and file their ITR by September 16 to avoid unnecessary penalties and complications.Chartered Accountant Hitesh Jain, Partner – Direct Tax, N. A. Shah Associates LLP, explained that under Section 115BAC, effective from Assessment Year 2024-25, the new tax regime is the default option.Jain said, “So if a taxpayer wants to opt for the old regime, then ITR needs to be filed before the due date prescribed under Section 139(1) which is September 15, 2025 for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26).”This means that taxpayers without business income can select the old tax regime only through the original ITR filed on or before the due date. Jain added that deductions such as house rent allowance (HRA), home loan principal and interest under Section 80C, leave travel allowance (LTA), and others cannot be claimed if the ITR is filed after the deadline. In cases where the total tax liability is lower under the old regime, missing the September 15 deadline could lead to a higher effective tax liability.Taxpayers who miss the September 16 deadline for filing their ITR must pay a late fee of up to Rs 5,000. Those with an annual income exceeding Rs 5 lakh will be liable for a Rs 5,000 fee, while individuals earning below Rs 5 lakh will pay Rs 1,000. No late fee is charged for filing a nil belated return.A belated ITR is treated the same as a return filed on or before the original deadline when it comes to refunds. Taxpayers can claim a refund when filing a belated ITR, provided they complete all necessary bank validation and compliance requirements.One has to file an ITR after the due date (belated ITR) by logging into the ITR filing portal and then select the filing section as 139(4). The rest process is the same as filing an original ITR.Belated ITRs can be revised, but only until December 31, 2025. Any revision requests submitted after this date will not be accepted.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.

1. Paper checks end



2. Payments could be garnished



3. Higher taxes for some workers



4. COLA raises benefits

5. Medicare costs likely to rise





Social Security affects millions of Americans, with over 70 million receiving payments in July, and the number continues to rise each month.Although the program is in need of major reforms, it frequently undergoes smaller adjustments. Some are set by law, while others can be made through executive orders, a power that US President Donald Trump has actively used in his first seven months back in office.Here are five upcoming Social Security changes that retirees should know about:Trump signed an executive order in March ending paper Social Security checks. The deadline for compliance is September 30, meaning October will mark the first month without paper checks.Recipients must now have a direct deposit set up with their bank or use a Direct Express card, a prepaid debit card for those without bank accounts.A Social Security spokesperson advised, as quoted by USA Today, “If you're one of them, be sure to update your information with the Social Security office or online at my social security before the end of the month.”The department of education paused student loan collections in 2020 but resumed in May 2025.Temporary delays on garnishing Social Security payments are ending.The DOE said in June, “Please be aware that the department of education is delaying offsets of these monthly benefits for a couple of months and plans to resume sometime this summer.” Defaulting recipients may see up to 15% of their benefits garnished.Social Security is funded through payroll taxes, with workers paying 6.2% of earnings, matched by employers. High earners pay taxes only up to the maximum taxable income, which rises annually.For 2025, the maximum taxable earnings is $176,100, up from $168,600 in 2024. This means higher-income workers will pay more in Social Security taxes, boosting program revenue.Social Security benefits are protected against inflation via a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Recipients received a 2.5% increase in 2025, and analysts predict a 2.7% adjustment for the upcoming year, based on current data. The official number will be confirmed in mid-October.Medicare Part B premiums are automatically deducted from Social Security benefits. Due to rising healthcare costs, 2026 premiums are estimated to reach $206.20 per month, up from $185 this year, an 11.5% increase.For recipients with lower Social Security payments, the “hold harmless” policy protects them from reductions due to higher Medicare premiums. However, most beneficiaries will still experience the impact of rising healthcare costs on their monthly payments.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March ending paper Social Security checks.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: US lawmakers and community leaders voiced concern over US President Donald Trump's plan to impose a USD 100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, calling the move ""reckless"" and ""unfortunate"" that will have a ""huge negative"" impact on the IT industry.Trump's USD 100,000 H-1B visa fee is a ""reckless attempt to cut America off from high-skilled workers who have long strengthened our workforce, fuelled innovation, and helped build industries that employ millions of Americans,"" Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said.Krishnamoorthi said many H-1B holders ultimately become citizens and launch businesses that create well-paying jobs in the US. ""While other nations race to attract global talent, the United States should strengthen its workforce and modernise our immigration system-not erect barriers that weaken our economy and security,"" he said.Former advisor to president Joe Biden and Asian-American community leader on immigration policy, Ajay Bhutoria, warned of a potential crisis for the US technology sector's competitive edge with Trump's new plan to impose the ""staggering"" H1-B fee.""The H-1B programme, a lifeline for innovation that has attracted top talent from around the world, faces unprecedented barriers with this massive jump from the current USD 2000-USD 5000 total fee, which will crush small businesses and startups reliant on diverse talent,"" Bhutoria said.Bhutoria added that the move will drive away skilled professionals who power Silicon Valley and contribute billions to the US economy.He said the move may backfire by pushing talent to competitors like Canada or Europe. He called for a balanced reform like exempting startups or prioritising merit-based selection instead of ""this extreme overhaul"".Khanderao Kand of the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies said the USD 100,000 fee for H1-Bs is a very unfortunate policy with huge negative impact on businesses particularly software and tech industry as well as US-educated STEM talent who are already struggling due to negative impact of AI and tariffs.

A proposed US-China agreement on TikTok would give Americans a majority on a board overseeing the app’s US operations, the White House said Saturday.“Americans will control six of the seven seats for a planned board,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News, according to the Associated Press.Leavitt added, “We are 100 per cent confident that a deal is done. Now that deal just needs to be signed, and the president's team is working with their Chinese counterparts to do just that.”Her comments came a day after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed a TikTok deal in a lengthy phone call.A key issue in ongoing US-China negotiations has been whether TikTok would retain its algorithm following a potential divestment of its China-based parent company, ByteDance.Leavitt noted that “the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,” offering more detail on how the deal, at least in the eyes of the White House, is taking shape.According to her, tech giant Oracle would be responsible for the app’s data and security. Oracle is led by billionaire Larry Ellison, who briefly became the world’s richest person last week before Elon Musk reclaimed the top spot, pushing Ellison to number 2.Congress passed legislation mandating a TikTok ban to take effect in January. However, Trump repeatedly signed orders allowing the app to continue operating in the United States while his administration worked to reach an agreement for ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based parent company, to sell its US operations.Trump said that American investors were “lined up” and that Xi had been “a gentleman” about the matter, but he remained vague on whether China would retain control of TikTok’s algorithm.“It’s all being worked out. We’re going to have very good control,” he stated. statement from the Chinese government following the call did not clarify what Xi had agreed to regarding the sale of a controlling stake by ByteDance, to avoid a US ban.Leavitt expressed confidence that the agreement would be finalised soon. “Now we just need this deal to be signed,” she said. “And that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days.”","US-China agreement would give Americans a majority on a board overseeing the app’s US operations. “Americans will control six of the seven seats for a planned board,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.

Donald Trump’s $100K H-1B Visa Fee Shocker Sparks Fears Among Indian Tech Workers And US Firms





Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) emerged as the second-largest recipient of H-1B visas in 2025, with over 5,500 approvals, following Amazon, which received 10,044, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).Other top beneficiaries included Microsoft (5,189), Meta (5,123), Apple (4,202), Google (4,181), Deloitte (2,353), Infosys (2,004), Wipro (1,523), and Tech Mahindra Americas (951).In a move that could significantly impact Indian IT professionals in the US, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing a staggering annual H-1B visa fee of $100,000, aimed at curbing what the administration termed “systemic abuse” of the programme.The restriction applies to petitions filed after September 21, 2025, and is set to expire after 12 months unless extended.The proclamation cited a sharp rise in foreign STEM workers in the US, noting that between 2000 and 2019, the number of foreign STEM professionals more than doubled while overall STEM employment grew by just 44.5 per cent. “Information technology firms have prominently manipulated the H-1B system, significantly harming American workers in computer-related fields,” the proclamation said, highlighting that IT outsourcing companies now dominate H-1B approvals.According to USCIS, many US tech companies have reportedly laid off thousands of American employees while simultaneously securing approvals for large numbers of H-1B workers.One firm approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY25 laid off more than 15,000 US employees, while another received approval for nearly 1,700 visas and cut 2,400 American jobs in Oregon, as per news agency PTI.Critics argue that H-1B visas are often used for entry-level jobs, allowing companies to save costs by hiring foreign workers at lower wages. The proclamation noted that IT firms could pay up to 36 per cent less for H-1B “entry-level” positions compared with full-time American workers.The new $100,000 fee comes alongside a $1 million “gold card” visa, offering a path to US citizenship for wealthy investors, while a $5 million “platinum card” allows up to 270 days of US stay without taxation on foreign income.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said the fee hike is likely to reduce H-1B applications, noting, “If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa”.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) emerged as the second-largest recipient of H-1B visas in 2025, with over 5,500 approvals.

Companies dependent on H-1B visas





H-B visa fee hiked! The Donald Trump administration sent shockwaves across the technology sector - particularly Indian IT, by substantially hiking the fee for H-1B visas. The revised regulations mandate organisations recruiting foreign professionals on H-1B visas from abroad to submit a whopping $100,000 payment for each application!This decision could notably affect Indian IT professionals and workers in the United States.This substantial fee aims to discourage programme misuse whilst ensuring access to exceptional candidates. These limitations shall continue for 12 months, subject to potential extension following assessment by federal bodies.The Trump administration has introduced the significant modifications to the H-1B visa scheme through a presidential declaration effective September 21, 2025.Officials state this initiative targets widespread exploitation of the programme, specifically in the IT industry, where domestic employees are displaced by overseas workers receiving lower compensation.The declaration additionally instructs authorities to modify existing wage structures and give preference to specialists commanding higher salaries. The Secretary of Homeland Security retains discretion to grant exceptions where recruitment serves national objectives without compromising security considerations.The H-1B programme serves as a temporary work permit system in the United States, enabling US firms to recruit overseas talent for specialised positions.These positions typically are for roles demanding theoretical knowledge or technical competency in sectors such as IT, engineering, mathematics, medicine and science.This visa arrangement helps address skill shortages in the American labour market by bringing in qualified professionals, initially for three years with possible extension to six years. During this period, the visa holder can legally reside and work in the US whilst maintaining employment with the sponsoring organisation.The scheme requires employers to verify that the position demands specialist expertise and that the international candidate possesses the necessary qualifications. Indian professionals, particularly in technology and engineering fields, constitute a significant portion of H-1B visa recipients.The existing H-1B visa application fees are already high. It varies between $1,700 and $4,500, with the higher amount applicable for expedited processing, according to CBS News. Employers generally categorise these charges as operational business expenditure.It has been hiked by 22.2 times the $4,500 fee that is currently required to be paid by employers for H-1B visas. This means that the H-1B visa fee has seen a 2,111.1% hike from the $4,500 levels.US President Donald Trump's proclamation ""Restriction on entry of certain nonimmigrant workers"" stipulates that entry into the United States for nonimmigrants will require their H-1B petitions to include an additional payment of $100,000.According to the directive, the limitation will end after 12 months from September 21, 2025, unless extended.The document indicated that foreign STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) workforce in the United States increased from 1.2 million to approximately 2.5 million between 2000 and 2019, whilst overall STEM employment only grew by 44.5 per cent in the same period.Within computer and mathematics positions, the proportion of foreign workers increased from 17.7 per cent in 2000 to 26.1 per cent in 2019. The document identified H-1B visa misuse as the primary contributor to this surge in foreign STEM employment.Latest data from federal sources reveals Amazon leads with 10,044 H-1B visa approvals as of June 2025, whilst TCS holds the second position with 5,505 approved visas.Following closely are Microsoft and Meta with 5,189 and 5,123 approvals respectively. Apple secured 4,202 visas, whilst Google obtained 4,181. Deloitte received 2,353 approvals, followed by Infosys with 2,004, Wipro with 1,523, and Tech Mahindra Americas with 951 approvals, according to a PTI report.The directive noted that technology companies have ""prominently manipulated"" the H-1B programme, causing substantial disadvantages to US computer sector professionals.The proportion of IT professionals in the H-1B programme increased from 32 per cent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 to over 65 per cent on average in the previous 5 fiscal years. Additionally, several major H-1B employers are presently IT outsourcing organisations.The document referenced a technology sector study showing that employing these H-1B-dependent IT outsourcing firms results in considerable cost reductions, with H-1B ""entry-level"" positions costing 36 per cent less compared to traditional full-time employees.The directive claimed that companies are exploiting the system by shutting down their IT departments, dismissing American employees, and shifting IT positions to foreign workers at reduced wages, taking advantage of artificially reduced labour expenses encouraged by the scheme.According to the proclamation, many American technology firms have dismissed their skilled American workforce whilst recruiting thousands of H-1B workers simultaneously.A particular software enterprise received approval for more than 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025, whilst announcing redundancies affecting over 15,000 staff members. Similarly, another IT organisation, approved for roughly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025, declared the dismissal of 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July.The proclamation further noted that a third organisation has decreased its American workforce by approximately 27,000 since 2022, whilst receiving approval for more than 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. Additionally, a fourth company, which reportedly eliminated 1,000 positions in February, secured approval for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025.The USCIS announced in July that it had received sufficient petitions to meet both the standard 65,000 H-1B visa cap and the additional 20,000 master's cap for advanced US degree holders for fiscal year 2026.","H-1B visa fee has been hiked by 22.2 times the $4,500 fee that is currently required to be paid by employers. This decision could notably affect Indian IT professionals and workers in the United States. Officials state this initiative targets widespread exploitation of the programme, specifically in the IT industry.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124011458,imgsize-62670,width-400,resizemode-4/h-1b-visa.jpg"
Donald Trump tariffs: Container freight rates likely to remain subdued amid uncertainty; expected to correct 10–15%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariffs-container-freight-rates-likely-to-remain-subdued-amid-uncertainty-expected-to-correct-1015/articleshow/124010484.cms,"AI image





Container freight rates are expected to remain subdued for the rest of FY26 as uncertainty in global trade continues, driven by US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies, industry experts said.According to ET, exporters rushed shipments to the US ahead of the August 27 deadline for a steep 50% tariff on Indian goods, targeting the Christmas season.India’s exports to the US rose 18% year-on-year to $40.39 billion during April-August 2025, far outpacing the country’s overall export growth of 2.5% to $184.13 billion in the same period.Meanwhile, China’s exports to India climbed over 10% to $51.57 billion, exceeding India’s overall import growth of 2.14%, reported ET.Ajay Sahai, director general and CEO of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), said freight rates are likely to see a 10-15% correction due to oversupply amid weakening global demand. “Inflationary pressures are persistent, and the risk of recession in advanced markets could deal a major blow to world trade,” he said, as per ET.The Drewry World Container Index fell 6% sequentially this week to $1,913 per 40ft container, down from more than $4,000 a year ago.On the South East Asia to East Coast North America route, rates dropped to $2,600 per 40ft container from $2,900 ten days earlier and nearly halved from $5,500 a year ago.Bhavik Mota, head of markets (Intra Gulf & Far East, West & Central Asia) at AP Moller - Maersk, said shipments of automotive products have declined sharply, while FMCG exports remain steady and pharmaceuticals are expected to stay resilient. “Exports of shrimp are vulnerable too. With prices climbing for end-consumers due to Trump’s tariffs, this could eventually translate into a larger drop,” he said, as per ET.Smaller Indian exporters are facing the brunt of high US tariffs, with some cancelling orders. “The end consumer will be impacted and it’s going to hurt demand. The large ones are sustaining, but smaller shippers are having problems,” said a senior shipping official.Not all markets are bleak. Improved trade relations with China have supported Indian imports ahead of the Diwali season, with Drewry’s Intra-Asia Container Index rising 5% sequentially to $611 per 40ft container, reflecting firmer regional trade.However, industry officials warn that unless tariffs on India are eased, long-term pressures on global supply chains could intensify.","India's exports to the US rose 18% year-on-year to $40.39 billion during April- August 2025.

Trump Gold Card Visa : Residency through a $1 million investment



What the Trump Gold Card looks like?



Trump Corporate Gold Card

Trump Platinum Card Visa



Program funding and implementation



Potential Impacts: Immigration and business







US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the launch of the much-anticipated “Gold Card Visa”, a program designed to attract wealthy individuals and corporations by offering them fast-track US residency in exchange for hefty investments.“They’re going to spend a lot of money to come in,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed the order creating the visa program.“It’s going to raise billions of dollars, billions and billions of dollars, which is going to go to reduce taxes, pay off debt and for other good things,” he added.The program introduces a tiered visa system, including the Gold Card ($1 million) and the upcoming Platinum Card ($5 million), along with a separate Corporate Gold Card for businesses sponsoring employees.The Trump Gold Card is the centerpiece of the new visa scheme. Individuals who wish to apply must pay a non-refundable processing fee (estimated at $15,000) and undergo Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vetting.If approved, applicants must make a $1 million contribution to the US Treasury, which the administration defines as a “gift” to demonstrate that the individual will substantially benefit the country.According to the program’s official website: “The Trump Gold Card is a visa based upon an individual’s ability to provide a substantial benefit to the United States. To apply, an applicant must pay a nonrefundable processing fee. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for visa adjudication will take place… If approved, an individual must make a gift of $1 million, which has been determined to provide sufficient evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States. ”Trump officials said successful applicants will be granted lawful permanent resident status, equivalent to EB-1 or EB-2 visa classifications, but processed in “record time.”The card itself is styled like a luxury credit card. It features a gold background, Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with “Trump Gold Card” stamped on the left.The Platinum Card design has not been revealed yet, but the website encourages applicants to join a waitlist immediately, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.According to the program, the Gold Card grants lawful permanent resident status under the EB-1 or EB-2 visa categories, subject to DHS approval. That would put recipients on a path to US citizenship, though officials have not specified exact timelines for naturalisation.The Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor foreign employees. For each worker sponsored, the business must contribute $2 million after DHS vetting and a processing fee.One feature that may appeal to businesses is flexibility. If a company ends the sponsorship of one employee, it can transfer the original $2 million contribution to another worker without paying the amount again.As the website explains, “The Trump Corporate Gold Card is issued to a corporate sponsor for one or more of the sponsor’s employees. To apply, the corporate sponsor must pay a nonrefundable processing fee per employee. Corporate sponsors may apply for multiple employees at once. A $2 million per employee gift upon completion of the employee’s vetting is evidence that the employee will substantially benefit the United States. The advantage of the Trump Corporate Gold Card is that corporate sponsors may cease sponsoring one employee and use the gift contribution tied to the prior application as a basis for sponsoring a new employee without a new $2 million gift. The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small annual maintenance fee and a transfer fee.”The program, however, includes annual maintenance fees and transfer charges for each reassignment.The Platinum Card, still pending congressional approval, will target ultra-wealthy individuals willing to invest $5 million. In exchange, recipients can reside in the United States for up to 270 days a year without paying taxes on non-US income.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he expects approval “later this year,” adding that the Platinum Card could significantly expand America’s ability to attract capital.The administration has marketed this tier as a unique mix of residency, extended stay rights, and tax incentives, making it especially attractive to high-net-worth individuals with global income streams.Trump signed an executive order directing that revenue from the Gold and Platinum Cards be deposited into a “separate fund” at the Treasury, earmarked for commerce promotion and debt reduction.Lutnick added that applicants would face “a much more rigorous vetting than has ever been done before,” and that the program would replace existing EB-1 and EB-2 visas.He said other green card categories would likely be suspended once the Gold Card model is implemented. The administration expects the rollout phase to last less than a month.The announcement signals a dramatic reshaping of US immigration policy. The Gold Card would replace traditional skill-based visas like EB-1 and EB-2, while Trump has also proposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, used by technology firms to hire skilled workers.Tech executives could be divided: while the Gold Card allows for new inflows of capital and workers under corporate sponsorships, the higher cost of H-1B visas could burden companies like Accenture and Cognizant. Shares of both firms dipped on Friday following Trump’s announcement.Immigration experts have also raised doubts about Trump’s claim that up to one million Gold Cards could be sold, pointing out that the pool of individuals able to afford the $1 million buy-in is relatively small.Trump first teased the Gold Card program in February, presenting it as an initiative that could draw global capital, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. On Friday, he reiterated its fiscal impact:Despite skepticism about demand, the Gold Card represents one of Trump’s most sweeping attempts yet to monetise the US immigration system while tying it directly to national revenue goals.","US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the launch of the much-anticipated ‘Gold Card Visa’ The program is designed to attract wealthy individuals and corporations by offering them fast-track US residency in exchange for hefty investments.

Donald Trump’s $100K H-1B Visa Fee Shocker Sparks Fears Among Indian Tech Workers And US Firms

Significance of the new rule





US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation on Friday (US time) introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, along with other changes to the skilled foreign worker programme, which has been under scrutiny for years.Originally designed to attract exceptional foreign talent for specialised technical roles, the H-1B programme has evolved into a channel for workers accepting salaries around $60,000 annually—well below the $100,000-plus compensation typical for American technology professionals, according to AP reports.""I think they're going to be very happy,"" Trump said, anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes.Additionally, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said, ""One of the most abused visa systems is the H1-B non-immigrant visa programme. This is supposed to allow highly skilled labourers who work in fields that Americans don't work in to come into the United States of America. What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers.It is noteworthy that First Lady Melania Trump, formerly Melania Knauss, received an H-1B visa in October 1996 for modelling work; she hails from Slovenia.Established in 1990, the H-1B programme targets individuals with bachelor's degrees or higher in difficult-to-fill positions, particularly in STEM fields. Critics argue the system enables lower wages and limited worker protections. The annual quota of 85,000 visas has traditionally been distributed through a lottery.Lottery applications fell nearly 40 per cent in 2024, following measures to prevent multiple entries that skewed selection odds. Major tech companies had requested reforms after surging applications reduced individual chances, prompting USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) to limit candidates to a single lottery entry, regardless of multiple job offers.Amazon currently leads in approvals with over 10,000, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, with California hosting the largest H-1B workforce.Detractors note that many H-1B positions are junior-level roles rather than senior specialist jobs. Companies can reportedly reduce costs by classifying roles at lower skill levels while employing experienced workers. This has led to outsourcing of basic technical operations to consultancies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tata, IBM, and Cognizant, which employ foreign workers—mostly from India—contracted to American firms seeking cost savings.While critics welcome these changes, they are calling for further reforms. The AFL-CIO said the measures are ""some steps in the right direction"" but advocated for visas to be allocated based on highest wage offers rather than random selection—a proposal previously floated during Trump’s first term.The increased fees could affect hiring foreign workers as it'll cost more for companies. Currently, companies pay $215 to register for the lottery and $780 for a Form I-129, the employer-sponsored petition for a non-immigrant worker.The move is expected to discourage mass applications for H-1B visas, particularly affecting startups and small businesses that may struggle to absorb the higher upfront cost. Companies hiring foreign workers will now face significantly higher expenses, potentially shifting focus back to American tech workers.The change also aims to curb abuse of the H-1B system, where companies hire foreigners at lower wages for entry-level roles, while paying Americans significantly more for the same jobs. With the $100,000 fee, hiring foreign talent becomes equally costly, likely reducing opportunities for H-1B-dependent workers.The overhaul comes amid discussions to reform or end the lottery system and raise wage requirements, prioritizing high-wage, high-skill foreign workers and opening more entry-level jobs for US graduates. The administration’s broader goal is to protect American employment in the technology sector.","US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

Gold prices remain firm, hovering near the $4,500 level on COMEX. Meanwhile, silver continues its strong upward momentum, supported by tight supply conditions, robust industrial demand, and broader market uncertainties. Recent US economic data indicated easing inflation and softer labor market conditions, strengthening expectations of multiple rate cuts next year, even as GDP growth surprised on the upside.Gold prices are gradually trending higher, consistent with their typical behaviour, and have registered a record high of ₹140,000 following a consolidation breakout from the ₹135,000 level last week. The broader technical structure continues to favor a buy-on-dips strategy, preferably through staggered investments.There remains a possibility of prices re-testing the recent support zone between ₹137,000 and ₹138,000.After the breakout, prices have been holding near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating sustained buying interest, with the mid-band around ₹135,000 acting as an immediate stop.Any pullbacks may be used for accumulation, while a decisive move above ₹140,000 could open the way toward targets of ₹143,000–₹145,000.It is a holiday-shortened week due to the New Year, though a few key events are lined up. Focus will be on US industrial production, housing numbers and FOMC meeting minutes.","Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Clocks 180 Kmph Speed: Watch Video

Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Features

The first two prototypes of the Vande Bharat sleeper have 16 coaches, including 11 air-conditioned three-tier coaches, four air-conditioned two-tier coaches, and one air-conditioned first-class coach.

Designed as a semi-high-speed service, the train can operate at speeds of up to 160 kmph, with testing conducted at 180 kmph. However, actual operating speeds will depend on track capabilities across the Indian Railways network.

Drawing on design elements from European rolling stock, the sleeper coaches will offer cushioned berths for improved comfort, along with redesigned upper-berth access to make climbing easier.

Passenger amenities include low-intensity night lighting, audio announcements supported by visual display systems, CCTV surveillance, and modular pantry arrangements.

The train will be fitted with advanced bio-vacuum toilets similar to those used in aircraft. Facilities will include an accessible toilet for persons with disabilities, a baby care unit, and shower cubicles with hot water in the AC First Class coach.

Safety systems include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision technology. Like the chair car version, the sleeper variant will also feature regenerative braking to enhance energy efficiency.

Coaches are equipped with fully sealed gangways and automatic interconnecting doors, helping maintain interior air quality and stable temperature levels.

Each coach offers individual reading lamps, charging sockets, foldable refreshment tables, and interiors finished with GFRP panels. Train doors will open automatically at designated stations.

A Centralised Coach Monitoring System has been installed, along with emergency communication facilities that allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive driver.

Vande Bharat sleeper train launch soon! Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday shared an important update on the Vande Bharat sleeper train, posting a video on X (formerly Twitter) of the train’s speed trial.

Gold & silver price prediction: Where are gold & silver headed in 2026? Here’s the outlook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-silver-price-prediction-where-are-gold-silver-headed-in-2026-heres-the-outlook/articleshow/126246875.cms,"2025 has been an extraordinary year for precious metals, marked by gold gaining nearly 71% and silver surging an impressive 150%. (AI image)

By Praveen Singh

Drivers of 2025 rally:

Spot gold, currently at $4487, up around 71% YTD, is making 2025 its second-best year after 1979 (126%).

The ongoing exponential rally in gold this year has been powered by a confluence of strong fundamental factors including political concerns, geopolitical tensions, concerns about the US Dollar as a global reserve currency, inflation hedging, trade wars and mounting macroeconomic worries as surging debt and reckless fiscal spending by the governments in key economies are leading to a fiscal dominant policy, which is nothing but fast-paced fiat currency debasement.

Mounting risks to the US Dollar and US treasuries have broken the traditional relationship of gold with key drivers like US Dollar and yields. These seismic changes in the global macroeconomic and geopolitical landscapes have led to unprecedented gold buying by central banks in recent years as they diversify their forex reserves.

The official sector, i.e., central banks, which became net gold buyers since 2009, has boosted the gold’s share in its forex reserves making the shiny metal as the second largest asset in central banks’ reserves.

Macroeconomic & policy backdrop:

Political polarization is straining social fabric amid rising inequality.

The US fiscal deficit, at 6.1% ($1 .9 trillion) as compared to fifty-year average of 3.8%, amid unhinged government borrowing puts fiscal trajectory on an unsustainable path.

The current debt/GDP ratio of 100% is expected to surge to 118% in 2035.

Enormous net interest payment (NIP) load (around $1 trillion for 2025 exceeds defense spending) and sharply growing gap between revenues and outlays will lead to a cumulative fiscal deficit of around $22 trillion in 2025-2035 period. NIP/Primary deficit ratio rising to nearly 200% by then is a huge potential risk to its economic stability.

Despite rate cuts, long-term yields are surging globally on fiscal concerns and inflationary outlook as currency debasement continues unbated reducing the purchasing power of the fiat currencies.

Surging long-term yields may force the US Federal Reserve to go for Yield Curve Control (YCC)/quantitative easing (QE) to mitigate risks to the economy and bring down cost of interest, which will be bullish for gold and silver.

The Fed is expected to cut rates twice in 2026 in response to weakening US job market. We think that there could be more than 2 cuts. The Fed Chair Powell at his December 10 post FOMC voiced his concern that the nonfarm payrolls could have been overstating jobs by as much as 60K since April, which means the total number 277K jobs created since April might be masking a loss of over 200K jobs.

Trump’s tariff wars and ‘US first’ agendas make the geopolitical situation quite vulnerable and volatile amid elevated economic uncertainty, prompting nations to rethink globalization—effectively a geopolitical reset. The US and China caught up in a struggle for global supremacy will continue to support precious metals.

Heightened geopolitical risks due to ongoing Ukraine war, volatile situation in Middle East and simmering tensions in the Caribbean due to US-Venezuela standoff will keep huge geopolitical risk premiums embedded in gold prices.

Institutional risk is rising as political pressure on the Fed grows. With Stephen Miran, Chair of Council of Economic Advisers, on the Fed Governor Board and Kevin Hassett (a vocal proponent of lower rates) being floated as a potential successor to Powell, questions around Fed independence and inflation credibility intensify.

As the Federal Reserve, running a fiscal dominant monetary policy, cuts rates into elevated inflation and normalizes 3% inflation, its credibility to contain inflation is being questioned, more so as the Fed’s independence faces political threat.

The US Dollar Index, already down 10% YTD, faces further losses due to huge US twin deficits, diversification, loose monetary policy and the US government’s intent to weaken the Dollar to support the hollowed-out US manufacturing sector, a deeply politicized subject.

China and Europe, sensing an opportunity in the Dollar woes, continue to promote their currencies. We are also seeing increased bipartite/regional trade deals which will further erode the US Dollar’s role in global trade.

It is to be noted that fiscal worries and inflation concerns are visible in key economies like Japan, China, UK, etc. as well, so it is not merely a US-centric phenomenon. As government bonds face downside pressure, it is expected that the traditional 60:40 portfolio will change soon to accommodate precious metals also.

Positioning & flows:

AI-led lofty equity valuation and ROI concerns add to gold’s appeal.

Global gold ETF holdings of ~98.41 Moz are up ~18.7% YTD (+484t), the highest since Sep-2022. 2025 net inflows are the strongest since 2009 (644t); all-time high is 111.25 Moz (15 Oct 2020).

Central-bank reserves: gold’s share is ~28%, second after US Dollar and near 3-decade high.

The yellow metal’s share is reportedly above US treasuries for the first time since 1996.

Gold’s share in global FX reserves has nearly tripled since the 2007–08 crisis; with gold’s share near 75% in the 1980s, there remains ample runway for official sector buying.

View and target:

I remain constructive on gold and look for a target of $5000 in 2026. There is an upside risk to the target though.

Silver: moving out of gold’s shadow

Silver has stepped out of the shadows of the yellow metal as it builds on the gold rally with an enormous momentum.

The grey metal, currently at $72.33, has surged 150% YTD.

Fundamentals:

Strong bullish underpinnings rooted in green energy transition, AI and new demand sources like nuclear reactors, medical devices, defense technologies, etc. support our bullish thesis with industrial demand at a record high.

The metal is deriving its strength from tight inventory too as investors pile into the metal on its relatively cheaper valuation as compared to gold. In addition, strong ETF demand for silver has been resulting in inventory dislocation and tight inventory also, which is also a huge catalyst for silver rally.

Gold/Silver ratio, which surged to 105 in the wake of ‘Liberation Day’ shock in April, has plummeted to 62 as silver caught up with gold rally.

The silver market, currently in the fifth consecutive year of deficit, is expected to be in deficit in 2026, too.

Supply crunch has been felt in India, China and most notably in the LBMA market. One-month LBMA silver lease rate at 6% is at the highest since October 23 and is well-above the historical lease rate of 0.3%-0.5%.

Flows & positioning:

Silver ETF holdings of ~871 Moz are up ~21% YTD, the highest since June 2022.

Net inflows of ~4820 tons YTD are the strongest since 2020 (8,802t), and ETF holdings could surpass the 2021 peak (~1.02B oz).

Policy tailwinds to be supportive:

Possibility of QE/yield curve control in the US and stimulus in Germany, China, and the US should reinforce the demand for the metal.

View and target:

I continue to remain constructive on the grey metal and expect it to reach ~$85-$95 in 2026. At the same time, given that ~70% of silver demand is industrial, price action at times may be volatile sensitive to monetary policy, broader market corrections, and macro shifts.

Is it too late to start investing in precious metals?

It’s a natural question especially after the meteoric rallies in gold and silver. Despite their strong performance, our long‑term outlook still sees gold eventually moving into the $6,500–$7,000 range, while silver could advance toward $125 by the end of the decade.

Given this trajectory, it’s not too late for investors who may have missed the earlier upswings. Beginning to build exposure now through a systematic, disciplined investment approach can still position portfolios to benefit from the structural strength underpinning precious metals over the long term.

2025 has been an extraordinary year for precious metals, marked by gold gaining nearly 71% and silver surging an impressive 150%. As 2025 draws to a close, it’s an ideal moment to reflect on what 2026 may hold. With strong fundamentals and deep‑rooted structural forces supporting a long‑term bullish outlook for hard assets, particularly precious metals, it is reasonable to expect that 2026 could deliver another year of substantial gains.Indeed, it wouldn’t be far‑fetched to anticipate gold and silver maintaining their strength well into the remainder of the decade. Looking for a historical parallel to today’s surge in precious metals, the current rally closely echoes the boom of the 1970s a period defined by intense geopolitical tensions, runaway inflation, and the emergence of a new monetary and financial order following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971. It is worth highlighting that despite stellar performance of the metals, both gold and silver continue to remain under owned as gold ETF share of total global ETF AUM is 2.8%, while silver ETF share is merely 0.25%; the very fact itself may serve as a positive catalyst going forward."," 2025 has been an extraordinary year for precious metals, marked by gold gaining nearly 71% and silver surging an impressive 150%.

Croatia was the last to join in January 2023.Bulgaria's accession will bring the number of Europeans using the euro to more than 350 million.","Bulgaria will become the 21st eurozone member on Wednesday night. The country will ditch its lev currency, which has been in use since the late 19th century. Some Bulgarians worry the introduction of the euro could lead to price increases.

Strong balance sheet, growing Corp. confidence

MUMBAI: India's dealmaking activity is expected to keep up the pace next year after a strong run in 2025. Domestic consolidation hit $104 billion this year, its strongest showing in two years, while inbound deals climbed to $30 billion as banks from East Asia and the Middle East acquired stakes in Indian lenders. Outbound deals surged to $22 billion this year, the highest in a decade, led by overseas acquisitions by Tata Motors and Tega Industries. Among emerging markets, India ranked second, behind China’s $410 billion, according to Dealogic.“In 2026, we anticipate continued momentum in mergers and acquisitions (M&As), driven by strong balance sheets and growing corporate confidence,” said S Sundareswaran, Morgan Stanley’s India head of M&A.While financial services, technology, and healthcare have traditionally dominated deal flow, a broader range of sectors is expected to participate next year, Sundareswaran said. “Activity will be fuelled by both domestic players and global strategic acquirers, with inbound M&A expanding beyond financial services and industrials, despite occasional exits by foreign players.”Domestic consolidation will continue to be a key theme as Indian corporates pursue strategic growth locally while selectively exploring international opportunities, said Amit Thawani, Nomura’s India head of investment banking.The makeup of M&A participants is also shifting. “While conglomerates have traditionally led domestic consolidation, we are increasingly seeing mid-cap companies that were virtually absent in this type of consolidation also entering the M&A arena,” Thawani said, citing Mankind Pharma’s takeover of Bharat Serums and Vaccines, Tilaknagar’s buy of the Imperial Blue brand, and Jubilant’s acquisition of Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages as recent examples.“Inbound M&A will continue in sectors such as financial services, consumer, and infrastructure, which remain attractive to foreign investors over the long term,” said Rahul Mody, co-head of investment banking at Ambit.However, inbound M&As are transitioning from a volume-driven to a value-driven model. “While deal volumes have declined over the past three years, transaction values rose sharply this year, signaling that foreign investors are becoming more selective while committing larger sums per deal,” said Sumeet Abrol, partner at Grant Thornton Bharat, adding that “Investments are also concentrated in policy-aligned sectors including financial, manufacturing and energy. ”Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan’s $4.4 billion acquisition of a 20% stake in Shriram Finance was the year’s largest inbound deal in the financial sector. Dubai-based Emirates NBD followed with a $3 billion investment in RBL Bank, while Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation injected $1.6 billion into Yes Bank.The next year could see the privatisation of IDBI Bank as India plans to cut the number of public sector banks from 12 to four or six. Fairfax Group and Kotak Mahindra Bank have shown interest in IDBI Bank, highlighting the growing interest in financial services.Dealmakers’ optimism for an active 2026 is underpinned by rising disposable incomes, consumption growth, and a supportive policy environment. India has taken steps to boost dealmaking by allowing banks to finance M&A transactions, raising foreign direct investment limits in insurance, and permitting direct share swaps between Indian and foreign companies.The proposed $2.3 billion overseas acquisition of Encora by Indian IT firm Coforge will be among the first listed-space deals under revised foreign exchange rules allowing overseas shareholders of Encora to indirectly own a stake in Coforge. Previously, Indian companies were barred from issuing shares to foreign owners in exchange for overseas assets, effectively preventing non-cash deals.Bharat Anand, senior partner at Khaitan & Co said expectations of lower US Fed interest rates could further support dealmaking, adding to dealmakers’ optimism for 2026, as reduced borrowing costs typically boosts M&As.","India's dealmaking activity is expected to keep up the pace next year after a strong run in 2025.

"As jewellery shines, Titan’s watches and CaratLane close in on $1 bn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/as-jewellery-shines-titans-watches-and-caratlane-close-in-on-1-bn/articleshow/126259251.cms,"Bengaluru: Even as jewellery continues to account for about 90% of Titan's revenues, its other businesses—watches and CaratLane—are now in the fast lane, within striking distance of the $1-billion revenue mark over the next few years. ""Watches are certainly on their course, in consumer price terms, to reach that billion. Given the way they are progressing, and the way we are seeing the projection, we expect it to be there—driven, of course, by premiumisation, but also by volume growth through our portfolio of brands: Fastrack, Sonata, not just Titan, and of course the channels between Titan World, Helios Luxe, and Fastrack stores,"" said Ajoy Chawla, who succeeds CK Venkataraman as managing director on Thursday.The watches business grew 17.2% year on year to Rs 4,576 crore in the 2024-25 financial year, while CaratLane's revenue stood at Rs 3,583 crore. Titan's jewellery business remained the largest contributor, reporting revenue of Rs 46,571 crore, up 21.4% year on year. Chawla said the average watch price across Titan's channels—now branded as Titan World—more than doubled from Rs 3,000–Rs 4,000 7 to 8 years ago to over Rs 8,000 today, reflecting a steady shift towards higher-value products.The watches division now operates 1,259 stores across formats.Venkataraman said premiumisation is clearly visible in the watches business. ""We sold higher-priced watches, going all the way up to—I think we even crossed Rs 10 lakh, maybe, for a Nebula. We sell quite a few pieces around Rs 3–4 lakh in Nebula, a lot of watches between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh, and some in the Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh range. So the overall share of watches priced at Rs 25,000-plus rose markedly over the last few years,"" he said. ""We see that runway open for the next 1 or 2 decades—millions of people acquiring wealth and much higher incomes. So it is really a decade- or 2-decades kind of opportunity.""Chawla said Titan, as a house of lifestyle and design-led brands, has ""truly come of age"". ""We are fortunate to be operating at a time when discretionary spending is rising and premiumisation is accelerating in India. The priority is sustaining the kind of growth we delivered over the last 5 to 6 years—growth is oxygen for any organisation,"" he said. ""Beyond growth, my focus is on increasing the potency of our brands. ""Beyond watches and CaratLane, Titan also has other up-and-coming businesses in its portfolio that are on track to reach the half-billion-dollar mark. Speaking about Damas, Chawla said, ""Damas—maybe the first milestone, maybe half a billion, depending on how the dollar-rupee moves, ... I would say maybe in the next 3 to 4 years, we would be getting close to $500 million."" Titan acquired a 67% stake in GCC-based Damas Jewellery for $283 million and plans to acquire the remaining 33% by end-2029.Following the acquisition, Venkataraman said the jewellery division is exploring tariff-mitigation options, including potential manufacturing in the UAE, while stressing there is no shift away from India. Chawla also pointed to TEAL—Titan Engineering and Automation Limited—as another business that could hit the $500-million revenue mark, driven by precision manufacturing for aerospace, defence, and semiconductor equipment.Venkataraman, who took the helm in 2019, transformed Titan into a diversified lifestyle powerhouse, growing revenues from a little over Rs 19,900 crore to over Rs 57,000 crore. Even as he superannuates, he deflects credit for the expansion. ""Over the last 5 to 6 years, we consciously worked towards becoming a full-fledged lifestyle company—perfumes, bags, sarees, jewellery, watches, smartwatches, and more,"" he said.Titan reported 22% revenue growth to Rs 57,818 crore in FY25. Venkataraman also navigated macro challenges, including rising gold prices. Higher prices muted buyer growth in lower-ticket jewellery below Rs 1 lakh, though value growth remained strong, aided by studded jewellery, bullion coins, and modern designs in 18K, 14K, and even 9K.""Gold prices continue to rise, putting pressure on buyer growth, particularly in gold jewellery. Gold bullion coins, however, are doing very well—they are on a completely different growth trajectory,"" Chawla said. He added that customers are increasingly comfortable with lower-carat jewellery if there is transparency and clarity on value, reinforcing jewellery's appeal as a store of value.On international markets, Titan's jewellery strategy remains focused on the Indian diaspora, while Venkataraman said the US expansion began in large diaspora hubs such as New Jersey, Chicago, and Seattle, with smaller markets like Orlando now being explored. Both Chawla and Venkataraman declined to comment on Titan's foray into lab-grown diamonds.","Titan's jewellery business remained the largest contributor, reporting revenue of Rs 46,571 crore, up 21.4% year on year.

Chinese imports: India imposes 12% tariff on steel inflows; aims to curb cheap shipments with safeguards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/chinese-imports-india-imposes-12-tariff-on-steel-inflows-aims-to-curb-cheap-shipments-with-safeguards/articleshow/126262418.cms,"'No Free Lift For India': PM Modi's Chief Economic Adviser Says China Won’t Repeat West’s Mistake

India rolled out a new trade measure on Tuesday, imposing safeguard duties on certain steel imports for a period of three years. The move comes as a push to protect domestic manufacturers from a surge in low-cost overseas supplies, particularly from China.As per a finance ministry notification, the safeguard duty will stand at 12% in the first year, ease to 11.5% in the second, and fall further to 11% in the final year. The decision follows a detailed probe into import trends and their impact on local producers.The levy will apply to steel shipments from countries including China, Vietnam and Nepal. However, imports from some developing nations have been kept outside the scope of the measure. The order also makes it clear that specialty steel products, such as stainless steel, will not be covered under the safeguard duty.The directorate general of trade remedies, which examined the matter, recommended the three-year tariff after observing a “recent, sudden, sharp ‍and significant ⁠increase in imports ... ⁠causing and threatening to cause serious injury to the domestic industry,” the order stated.The latest move builds on an earlier step taken in April, when the government imposed a temporary 200-day safeguard duty of 12% on similar steel products, according to a Reuters report.Officials from the federal steel ministry have repeatedly stated that unchecked inflows of cheap and sub-standard steel could harm India’s domestic steel sector, prompting the need for protective measures.The decision also comes against the backdrop of growing global trade tensions in the steel market. US President Donald Trump’s import tariffs on steel have intensified scrutiny of Chinese exports, leading countries such as South Korea and Vietnam to introduce anti-dumping duties earlier this year.","India imposes safeguard duties on certain steel imports for a period of three years.

All roads lead to Dalal Street: 2025 was year of IPOs; 2026 set to be bigger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/all-roads-lead-to-dalal-street-2025-was-year-of-ipos-2026-set-to-be-bigger/articleshow/126262314.cms,"Dalal Street, Mumbai

Dream debut

MUMBAI: Dalal Street is preparing for what could be its biggest year in the primary market, with 2026 expected to be a record-breaker for IPOs.About 197 companies have either received regulatory clearance or are awaiting approval from Sebi, representing potential fund mobilisation of around $31 billion.This builds on a strong 2025, when companies raised $22 billion through first-time share sales, making India the world's third-largest IPO hub after China and the US. According to LSEG data, India came close to matching China's $25-billion IPO proceeds, while remaining behind the US, which led with $39 billion.Jio Platforms is expected to spearhead the next wave of mega IPOs, potentially raising over $6 billion by selling a small stake - a deal that would make it India's largest-ever listing. Other names anticipated to test investor appetite include NSE, SBI Mutual Fund, PhonePe, Flipkart, Oyo, Zepto, boAt, Kent RO and Curefoods. The 2026 IPO cycle is expected to revolve around three major themes - digital economy platforms, financial infrastructure, and scaled consumer businesses. In contrast, financials and industrials dominated IPO activity in 2025, LSEG data showed.""2026 may prove to be a landmark period that could redefine India's capital market benchmarks,"" said Vikas Khattar, head of equity markets at Ambit.""The market is transitioning to a 'new normal' where annual IPO issuances are expected to structurally stay around $20 billion, supported by deep domestic liquidity and macroeconomic stability.""Abhishek Joshi, head of equity markets at UBS India, echoed the optimism: ""Given where things stand, 2026 could break IPO records of 2025. We could see IPO issuance of $20 billion-plus for the next few years,"" he said.Khaitan & Co partner Abhimanyu Bhattacharya added that the 2026 pipeline is ""arguably stronger"" than in 2025. ""The 'growth at all costs' narrative is now muted. Fundraising will be dominated by companies demonstrating a clear path to profitability and reasonable pricing,"" he said.Khattar also noted a shift in investor preferences. ""The market is moving away from cash-burning discovery stories toward businesses demonstrating credible profitability,"" he said.Offers for sale (OFS) dominated recent IPOs, accounting for 85% of the $22 billion raised in 2025, according to LSEG. ""In previous cycles, an IPO was a way for a company to get money to survive. That thinking has shifted,"" Khattar said. ""Most issuers not looking for fresh capital are firms that are operationally scaled and profitable, making their IPOs liquidity events rather than fundraisers. Large OFS is a sign of maturity, not a lack of confidence. ""Joshi added private equity's rapid growth has helped companies scale, with capital markets now offering enough liquidity for PE exits while giving public investors access to these firms.2025 listings were mixed, underscoring Bhattacharya's view that leaving money on the table is essential, with 2026 favoring performance-based pricing over perfection.","Jio Platforms is expected to spearhead the next wave of mega IPOs, potentially raising over $6 billion by selling a small stake.

PAN-Aadhaar Deadline Nears: How To Link Before December 31 Or Risk Inoperative PAN From Next Year

How to link PAN with Aadhaar card: Step-by-step guide

To begin with, you will have to pay a mandatory fee through the Income Tax Department’s e-Filing portal.

After choosing to pay through e-Pay Tax, you are required to re-enter your PAN, verify your mobile number through an OTP, select the Income Tax option, and proceed to payment.

The assessment year must be selected and the payment category should be marked as Other Receipts (500). The Rs 1,000 amount is auto-filled and can be paid using net banking, debit card, or UPI. The payment may take four to five working days to reflect in the system.

Once the payment is confirmed (which can take a few days), taxpayers can make the linking request.

Go to the Link Aadhaar section, enter your PAN and Aadhaar details, and validate the information.

A confirmation message stating ""Your payment details are verified."" should appear, after which users must enter their name as per Aadhaar and their mobile number.

They are also required to confirm Aadhaar validation and indicate if only the year of birth is mentioned on their Aadhaar record.

The process is completed by entering the six-digit OTP sent to the registered mobile number.

By selecting Link Aadhaar Status under Quick Links on the e-Filing homepage and entering PAN and Aadhaar details, users can view the current status. A successful linkage is indicated by a green checkmark, while pending cases will display a message stating that the request has been forwarded to UIDAI for validation.

"With the legendary Warren Buffett stepping back, Berkshire Hathaway enters a new era",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/with-the-legendary-warren-buffett-stepping-back-berkshire-hathaway-enters-a-new-era/articleshow/126255534.cms,"Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffett this week.Many regard Buffett as the world's greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett's personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving more than $60 billion away over the past 20 years.Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation's biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall's $9.7 billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn't big enough to make a difference in Berkshire's profits.Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire's trajectory, but don't expect any seismic shifts.Buffett isn't going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for.Some changes are likely CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that.The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett's longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company's culture.Part of Buffett's sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.""I think the investment community would likely applaud Greg's management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,"" Seifert said. ""And if it helps performance, that can't really be faulted.""Abel plays an active role managing companies Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance.Abel did announce some leadership changes earlier this month after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he's appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel's plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses.Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.But if Abel can't find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn't done that since early 2024.Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed.Berkshire has a solid foundation Many of Berkshire's subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire's utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due.Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire's businesses ""can almost take care of themselves."" He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel.One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs' departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74 and many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett.""As a long-term shareholder, we aren't too concerned with Todd's departure and don't think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,"" said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. ""Todd's situation is unique. It's just a reminder that Warren's pending departure is imminent and they're preparing for a new phase - one that we're still excited to see unfold.""",Greg Abel will take over Berkshire Hathaway from Warren Buffett this week. Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126255617,imgsize-737246,width-400,resizemode-4/warren-buffett.jpg"

US holds top spot as Taiwan's largest bank debtor for 41st straight quarter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-holds-top-spot-as-taiwans-largest-bank-debtor-for-41st-straight-quarter/articleshow/126227093.cms,"U.S. holds top spot as Taiwan's largest bank debtor for 41st straight quarter

The United States remains the top debtor of Taiwan banks for the 41st straight quarter. This means the U.S. owes more money to Taiwanese banks than any other country. According to a report by Focus Taiwan, this trend has continued for more than ten years without any change at the top spot.Citing data released by the central bank, the report shows that the money Taiwanese banks have tied up in the US grew by $4.03 billion. This is an increase of 2.07% from the end of June. By the end of September, the total amount reached $198.896 billion. The report noted that Hsieh Jen-chun, who is the deputy head of the central bank's Department of Financial Inspection, said the growth happened because banks put more money into U.S. securities and lending.On the other hand, Luxembourg is now the second-largest debtor to Taiwan's banks. It took the second spot away from China. Exposure to Luxembourg rose by $2.72 billion to reach $50.77 billion at the end of September. Hsieh said the increase happened because Taiwanese banks put more funds into trust assets in that European country. This is the third quarter in a row that the money kept in Luxembourg has grown.China fell to the third spot on the list. Even though the money tied up in China rose by about $1.07 billion to reach $49.56 billion, it is now less than Luxembourg.

Silver price today: White metal hits record high; spot silver surges past $80 an ounce mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/silvers-sparkling-rally-spot-silver-hits-record-high-surges-past-80-an-ounce-mark/articleshow/126224147.cms,"Silver continued its glittering rally on Monday, surging past the $80-an-ounce mark. The white metal's momentum was lifted by tight supplies, rising industrial demand and expectations of further US interest rate cuts. Besides silver, platinum also touched a record high, briefly.Silver's sparkling rally extended gains for the sixth straight session, surging 6% to touch a lifetime high of Rs 2,54,174 per kilogram in futures trade.Spot silver jumped 3.8% to $82.15 an ounce, after earlier hitting an all-time high of $83.62, according to Reuters.The metal has spiked 181% so far this year, sharply outperforming gold, as it broke through the $80 level amid supply constraints, low inventories and growing industrial and investment demand. Its inclusion on the US critical minerals list has also added to investor interest.The white metal later slipped 1.3% to $78.12 per ounce as investors booked profits.""A combination of profit-taking and seemingly productive talks between Trump and Zelenskyy regarding a potential peace deal have put gold, silver on the back foot,"" KCM trade chief market analyst Tim Waterer told Reuters.Gold prices eased slightly after scaling fresh highs in the previous session.Spot gold slipped 0.1% to $4,527.79 per ounce by 1152 GMT on December 28, having touched a record $4,549.71 earlier. US gold futures for February delivery were steady at $4,553.10 an ounce.Gold has been lifted by a mix of factors, including US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and bets on further easing, geopolitical tensions, sustained buying by central banks seeking to diversify away from US securities and the dollar, and rising holdings in exchange-traded funds. Traders continue to price in two US rate cuts next year, a backdrop that tends to favour non-yielding assets. The US dollar hovered near the two-month lows reached last Wednesday, offering some support to bullion, which has enjoyed a strong rally in 2025, climbing 72% so far.Geopolitical developments also remained in focus.US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were “getting a lot closer, maybe very close” to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.Among other precious metals, spot platinum slipped 0.8% to $2,429.10 an ounce after earlier rising to a record $2,478.50, while palladium edged up 0.1% to $2,003.83 an ounce.","Silver's rally extended gains for the sixth straight session, surging 6% to touch a lifetime high of Rs 2,54,174 per kilogram.

Attention is pinned on the minutes of the Fed’s December policy meeting, which is due for release on Tuesday. Meanwhile, recent strength in precious metals also showed signs of easing.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index traded at 25,944, adding 125 points or 0.49%. Japan's Nikkei was down over 200 points to 50,550. Shanghai and Shenzhen added 0.4% and 0.19%, respectively. In Korea, Kospi gained 1.6%, to reach 4,197 at 8:40 AM IST.With only a handful of trading sessions left in the year, sentiment has been supported by expectations that US interest rates could be cut further, alongside confidence that the rally led by technology stocks has not yet run out of steam. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve reduced borrowing costs as widely anticipated. However, it also struck a more measured tone, suggesting rates could remain unchanged at its next meeting, after two policymakers opposed a cut and one pushed for a deeper reduction.On the commodities front, gold and silver pulled back after surging to record levels in recent days. Both metals have benefited from strong buying interest, fuelled by expectations that lower interest rates would enhance their appeal, as well as their traditional role as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions, including US strikes in Nigeria and a blockade involving Venezuelan oil tankers, have further added to their attractiveness.Gold was hovering near $4,500 on Monday, after topping out just under $4,550 late last week. Silver slipped to $77.50, having briefly touched a record $80. The metal’s sharp rise has also been underpinned by tightening supply and rising industrial demand.Oil prices recovered some ground after falling more than two percent on Friday, as markets assessed developments from weekend talks between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on possible peace proposals.Trump said on Sunday that an agreement to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was closer than ever, though he acknowledged there had been no clear breakthrough on territorial questions. He added that it would become evident within weeks whether the nearly four-year-long conflict, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives, could be brought to an end.","Asian markets mostly traded in green on Monday, beginning the week on a positive note.

China's BYD poised to overtake Tesla in 2025 EV sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-byd-poised-to-overtake-tesla-in-2025-ev-sales/articleshow/126222415.cms,"Growing Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company in annual sales.The two groups are expected soon to publish their final figures for 2025, and based on sales data so far this year, there is almost no chance the American company led by Elon Musk will retain its leadership position.At the end of November, Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, had sold 2.07 million EVs so far in 2025.Tesla, for its part, had sold 1.22 million by the end of September.Tesla's September figures included a one-time boost in sales, to nearly half-a-million vehicles in a three-month period, before the expiration of a US tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles -- which ended under legislation backed by President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic.But Tesla's sales in the coming quarter are expected to fall to 449,000, according to a FactSet analysis consensus. That would give Tesla about 1.65 million sales for all of 2025, a drop of 7.7 percent and well below the level BYD had attained by end November.Deutsche Bank, which projects just 405,000 Tesla EV sales during the fourth quarter, sees the company's sales down by around one-third in both North America and Europe, and by one-tenth in China.- Transition period -Industry watchers say it will take time for EV demand to reach a level of equilibrium in the United States following the elimination of the $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025.Even prior to that, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of Trump and other far-right politicians. Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies and from European giants.""We believe Tesla will see some weakness on deliveries"" in the fourth quarter, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.Sales of 420,000 would be ""good enough to show stable demand,"" with Wall Street ""laser focused on the autonomous chapter kicking off in 2026,"" Ives added, referring to plans for self-driving vehicles.Even as it has grown quickly, BYD has faced challenges in its home market.With profitability in China weighed down by price-wary consumers, the company has sought to strengthen its foothold in foreign markets.BYD is ""one of the pioneers to establish overseas production capacity and supply chains for EVs,"" Jing Yang, Director of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings, told AFP.""Going forward, its geographical diversification is likely to help it to navigate an increasingly complicated global tariff environment,"" said Yang.Overseas rivals to BYD have balked at Chinese state subsidies and other state supports that have allowed the company to sell vehicles cheaply.Trump's predecessor Joe Biden imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports that could potentially go even higher under Trump. Europe has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, but BYD is building manufacturing capacity in Hungary.While the chance of Tesla reclaiming its global leadership in EVs looks uncertain, the American company is also potentially positioned for growth.Michaeli of TD Cowen sees autonomous technology playing an increasingly important role for Tesla, with breakthroughs in its ""full self-driving"" or ""FSD"" offerings potentially boosting sales.""As Tesla really begins to roll out eyes-off features and expand FSDs capability, if they do that successfully, that should generate more demand for their vehicles,"" Michaeli said.Musk has said the Cybercab, an autonomous robotaxi model, will begin production in April 2026. The company has also unveiled lower-priced versions of the Models 3 and Y that could boost sales.","Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company.

'Substantial' gains

Stability needed

SOFIA: Bulgaria will become the 21st country to adopt the euro on Thursday, but some believe the move could bring higher prices and add to instability in the European Union's poorest country.A protest campaign emerged this year to ""keep the Bulgarian lev"", playing on public fears of price rises and a generally negative view of the euro among much of the population.But successive governments have pushed to join the eurozone and supporters insist it will boost the economy, reinforce ties to the West and protect against Russia's influence.The single currency first rolled out in 12 countries on January 1, 2002, and has since regularly extended its influence, with Croatia the last country to join in 2023.But Bulgaria faces unique challenges, including anti-corruption protests that recently swept a conservative-led government from office, leaving the country on the verge of its eighth election in five years.Boryana Dimitrova of the Alpha Research polling institute, which has tracked public opinion on the euro for a year, told AFP any problems with euro adoption would be seized on by anti-EU politicians.Any issues will become ""part of the political campaign, which creates a basis for rhetoric directed against the EU"", she said.While far-right and pro-Russia parties have been behind several anti-euro protests, many people, especially in poor rural areas, worry about the new currency.""Prices will go up. That's what friends of mine who live in Western Europe told me,"" Bilyana Nikolova, 53, who runs a grocery store in the village of Chuprene in northwestern Bulgaria, told AFP.The latest survey by the EU's polling agency Eurobarometer suggested 49 percent of Bulgarians were against the single currency.After hyperinflation in the 1990s, Bulgaria pegged its currency to the German mark and then to the euro, making the country dependent on the European Central Bank (ECB).""It will now finally be able to take part in decision making within this monetary union,"" Georgi Angelov, senior economist at the Open Society Institute in Sofia, told AFP.An EU member since 2007, Bulgaria joined the so-called ""waiting room"" to the single currency in 2020, at the same time as Croatia.The gains of joining the euro are ""substantial"", ECB president Christine Lagarde said last month in Sofia, citing ""smoother trade, lower financing costs and more stable prices"".Small and medium-sized enterprises stand to save an equivalent of some 500 million euros ($580 million) in exchange fees, she added.One sector expected to benefit in the Black Sea nation is tourism, which this year generated around eight percent of the country's GDP.Lagarde predicted the impact on consumer prices would be ""modest and short-lived"", saying in earlier euro changeovers, the impact was between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points.But consumers -- already struggling with inflation -- fear they will not be able to make ends meet, according to Dimitrova.Food prices in November were up five percent year-on-year, according to the National Statistical Institute, more than double the eurozone average.Parliament this year adopted empowered oversight bodies to investigate sharp price hikes and curb ""unjustified"" surges linked to the euro changeover.But analysts fear wider political uncertainty risks delaying much needed anti-corruption reforms, which could have a knock-on effect on the wider economy.""The challenge will be to have a stable government for at least one to two years, so we can fully reap the benefits of joining the euro area,"" Angelov said.","Bulgaria will become the 21st country to adopt the euro on Thursday.

Chilean regulators authorized the alliance earlier in December.The agreement was approved by more than 20 national and international regulatory bodies, including in China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the European Union.Chile was the last of the countries to clear the deal.Last month, China gave the green light to the planned partnership between Codelco and SQM.The partnership aims to restore Chile's leadership in lithium production, a title it lost to Australia nearly a decade ago.The new company aims to increase production by about 300,000 tons per year in the Atacama salt flat.In 2022, Chile produced 243,100 tons of the so-called white gold.""This joint venture makes it possible to plan the development of the Atacama salt flat,"" and for the benefit of global markets, said Ricardo Ramos, CEO of SQM, one of the world's leading lithium producers.The partnership is part of the National Lithium Strategy announced by the leftist government of Gabriel Boric in 2023, aimed at reclaiming Chile's global leadership in lithium production.According to Codelco, with this agreement the Chilean state will receive around 70 percent of the operating margin generated by the new production between 2025 and 2030, and starting in 2031, 85 percent of that margin.Lithium accounted for three percent of Chile's exports in 2024.","Chile is the world's second-largest producer of lithium, a key component of EVs and other clean technologies.

China's industrial firms saw their profits drop by 13.1 per cent in November, from last year, marking the steepest decline in over a year. This fall came despite strong exports, putting focus on country's ongoing economic struggles and increasing pressure for more government support. The National Bureau of Statistics released these figures on Saturday, as quoted by Reuters.The decline was worse than October's 5.5 per cent. This trend comes as China faces persistent factory-gate deflation and weak consumer spending. For the first 11 months of the year, industrial profits barely grew, showing just a 0.1% increase compared to the previous year's 1.9% growth.""The profit numbers show a broader cooling in economic activity in the fourth quarter, mainly due to the drag from soft domestic demand,"" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Xu remained cautiously optimistic about future profits, suggesting companies might find more opportunities overseas.Despite this, there were some industries that managed to register gains. The automobile industry posted a 7.5 per cent rise in profitability, while the high tech industry posted a 10 per cent rise. A massive decline of 47.3 percent in profitability was seen in the coal mine industry.An estimate by the think tank, Rhodium Group, quoted by Reuters, indicated a growth of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in the Chinese economy for the year, which is approximately half the officially-hinted growth.Chinese policymakers are now promising more support. At a recent meeting, they pledged to maintain ""proactive"" fiscal policies next year. The government has also committed to improving employment, boosting consumption, stabilizing prices, and helping the struggling property market.NBS Chief Statistician Yu Weining noted that industrial firms still need stronger support, especially given the uncertain global environment and ongoing changes in growth drivers. The data covers companies earning at least 20 million yuan ($2.85 million) in annual revenue from their main operations.","China's industrial firms saw their profits drop by 13.1 per cent in November, from last year, marking the steepest decline in over a year.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge. The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104558088,imgsize-2534,width-400,resizemode-4/SISIRRADAR.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

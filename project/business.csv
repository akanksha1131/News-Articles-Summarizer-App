<p>HD Hyundai Heavy Industries plans<br></p>

HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the giant South Korean shipbuilding company, has initiated plans to establish a shipyard in India, conducting site visits this month to explore potential locations.The delegation from the company, which holds approximately 10% of the global market share in shipbuilding, visited Thoothukudi and Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. They also held discussions with L&T executives regarding possible collaboration. L&T operates a substantial shipyard in Kattupalli that handles shipbuilding, retrofitting and conversions.The company's interest extends beyond Tamil Nadu to other coastal states.""HD Hyundai Heavy Industries came down to India earlier this month to assess possible sites for a shipbuilding facility,"" a source familiar with the matter told ET. ""They have a shipyard in South Korea and are now very keen to build one in India to cater to the local demand.""""The competition between states is very intense now,"" revealed another source. ""It is not just in talks with Tamil Nadu but also Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, who are also courting the company aggressively.""In December 2023, an Indian delegation, headed by ports and shipping ministry secretary T.K. Ramachandran, visited major South Korean shipyards to explore collaborative opportunities for enhancing India's shipbuilding sector.The delegation conducted meetings in Seoul with representatives from Korea's leading three shipbuilding companies, including HD Hyundai.Also Read | Move away from Russia?

This plan seeks to reduce international freight expenses by one-third by 2047 and boost trade earnings through shared ownership between government-run entities and overseas companies.Also Read | Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‘very unfair’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla to set up a factory in India According to an industry expert, increasing environmental regulations and trade growth have created a higher demand for ships.""The present yards are full, with order books and looking to expand capacity,"" this person said. ""HHI has tried setting up yards in the Philippines in the past but were not very successful. With Indian government emphasis on local ship building, they can utilise this opportunity of increasing their base in countries outside Korea.""The expert emphasised that HHI's presence in India would significantly impact the Indian shipbuilding sector through technology sharing, enhanced ship owner confidence in Indian builders, and increased investment in advanced technologies.The HD Hyundai Group's establishment dates back to 1947 by Chung Ju-yung, though the shipbuilding venture began in the early 1970s under his leadership.Construction commenced in March 1972 on a coastal site that would develop into one of the world's premier shipyards.Also Read | 'More of white noise': Why Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India’s exports to US will have a ‘limited’ impact Located along Mipo Bay in Ulsan, Korea, the Hyundai shipyard spans four kilometres.

Latest income tax calculation post Budget 2025: Starting April 1, 2025, individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in taxable income under the new income tax regime will not need to pay any tax. For those earning above this threshold, there are ways to structure their salary to maintain taxable income below Rs 12 lakh. Various allowances within the new income tax regime can assist in reducing the taxable income to this limit.ET quotes Harsh Bhuta, Partner of Bhuta Shah & Co., a tax consulting firm as saying, ""Under the new tax regime, there are certain allowances in the Income Tax Act that can help taxpayers to rejig their salary structure. These allowances are exempt from tax in the new tax regime if certain conditions are met. These allowances can help taxpayers to reduce taxable income under the new tax regime.""Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? Employers can reimburse work-related travel expenses incurred by employees. Bhuta says, ""The conveyance reimbursement received by an employee is exempt if the same is expended while commuting to the workplace. An employee is required to submit bills to claim reimbursement.""This provision applies to specially-abled individuals. Unlike conveyance reimbursement, this allowance covers travel between home and workplace. Bhuta says, ""The transport allowance received by specially-abled employees is exempted up to Rs 3,200 per month or Rs 38,400 per annum. Only those specially-abled employees are exempted if they are blind/deaf/dumb or orthopaedically handicapped with a disability of the lower extremities.""Salaried employees can receive tax exemptions for reimbursed telephone bills. According to Yogesh Kale, Executive Director of Nangia Andersen LLP, ""There is no limit prescribed concerning the exemption of telephone and internet bills under either of the old or new income tax regimes. However, as an ideal practice, the reimbursement amount should be reasonable, considering an employee's designation and the roles and responsibilities.""He further explains, ""As telephone and internet expenses generally go hand in hand, many employers provide exemptions in respect of internet reimbursements to employees under the income tax rules, though the said rules provide that telephone expenses incurred by the employer on behalf of the employees do not qualify as perquisites in the old or new tax regime and do not specifically mention internet expenses.""Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: 8 salary perks to save around Rs 1.35 lakh income tax under old regime Staff members have the option to restructure their salary packages to incorporate telephone, mobile and internet bill reimbursements, potentially lowering their taxable income.Employers' car leasing arrangements can contribute to reducing taxable salary. When an employer provides a vehicle for both personal and official use, it is classified as a perquisite under the Income Tax Act.Kale explains, ""The perquisite value of a car given by the employer for the employee's personal and official use as per the income tax rules is very low. The valuation mechanism remains the same under the old and new regimes. The taxable value of such perquisite is Rs 1,800 per month if the engine's cubic capacity does not exceed 1.6 litres. An amount of Rs 2,400 per month would be taxable if the engine's cubic capacity exceeds 1.6 litres.""He continues, ""An amount of Rs 900 per month is added to the value of perquisite if the chauffeur is also provided to run the car. (Employees should remember that expenses on maintenance and running are met or reimbursed by the employer.) Thus, the amount taxable as perquisite in respect of a car given by the employer for the employee's personal and official use is much less as compared to the actual amount of expenditure that may be incurred by the employer.""The analysis presents two scenarios with varying basic salary percentages (30% and 40% of CTC). Higher basic salary percentages within the CTC enable greater tax savings at elevated CTC levels. Tax exemptions apply to mobile and conveyance reimbursements when bills are submitted timely to employers. Both cases include employer NPS contributions at 14% of basic salary under the new regime.The net taxable income reduces to Rs 12 lakh in both instances. This reduction occurs through submission of mobile and conveyance bills, claiming the Rs 75,000 standard deduction under the new regime, and employer NPS contributions under Section 80CCD (2) of the Income Tax Act.These calculations exclude additional income sources like share dividends, savings account interest, and fixed deposit returns. Including these would alter the final calculations.Kale states, ""The new tax regime from FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27) offers lower tax rates but limits many salary-based exemptions and deductions. Although options such as the ones discussed above provide a bit of scope for reducing the tax burden, the opportunities are more limited than under the old regime.""Under the new regime, meal coupons (Sodexo) from employers are taxable, whereas the old regime allowed tax exemption up to Rs 26,400 yearly (Rs 2,200 per month).Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime",Several allowances are available for taxpayers to restructure their salary and lower their taxable income.

India is set to construct the world's longest hyperloop test facility, which will help evaluate the feasibility of commercial operations for this advanced transport system. The infrastructure, capable of achieving speeds up to 1,100 kilometres per hour, follows the successful completion of a 422-metre test track in December 2024, according to officials.""Plans are being readied for a 40–50-kilometre (km) hyperloop test track in the country. It will be supported by the Indian Railways ,"" a senior official told ET.Hyperloop represents an emerging high-speed mass transit system. Whilst operating similarly to railways, it utilises advanced technologies aimed at delivering greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Various technological approaches are being explored globally to create a transportation system featuring capsules supported by air-bearing surfaces within low-pressure tubes.The 422-metre vacuum tube testing facility was established through a collaborative effort between Indian Railways, L&T Constructions and Avishkar Hyperloop at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.TuTr Hyperloop, a deep-tech venture incubated at IIT Madras, conducted India's first commercial intent hyperloop pod run on Monday. The firm has been working alongside Indian Railways to advance this technology. Additionally, an official statement indicated that Indian Railways and IIT Madras will collaborate on developing a vertical take-off landing vehicle, with funding from Indian Railways.The potential for hyperloop technology in India is substantial. As Denis Tudor, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Co-founder at Swisspod Technologies said, ""India has a great potential for hyperloop. It is estimated that a 40-kilometre test track would cost $150 -300 million upon completion depending on the dimension for the project.""A significant collaboration emerged when Tudor's Swiss-American enterprise and TuTr from India entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in March 2022. Both Swiss and Indian governments supported this partnership. Notably, Swisspod receives backing from Elon Musk, who serves as Senior Advisor to US President Donald Trump.The initial concept of the Hyperloop System originated from Swiss Professor Marcel Juffer during the 1970s. Subsequently, Swissmetro SA was established in 1992 to advance this innovation, though the company ceased operations in 2009.In Nevada, Virgin Hyperloop continues its system testing programme. The company has now prioritised freight transport applications, considering the complexities in passenger certification. Simultaneously, Canadian firm TransPod is developing a test facility to verify their distinctive propulsion and levitation mechanism. Additionally, China is advancing plans for a system similar to Hyperloop, intended to achieve hypersonic velocities.","The infrastructure, capable of achieving speeds up to 1,100 kilometres per hour, follows the successful completion of a 422-metre test track in December 2024.

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi has eased norms for security receipts - issued by asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) to manage bad loans - by allowing smaller finance companies to invest in the financial instruments.Sebi's outgoing chief Madhabi Puri Buch in a notification on Feb 28, her last day in office, allowed smaller NBFCs and housing finance companies to invest in the security receipts, expanding a market that was restricted to larger financial institutions.The move aims to inject liquidity into distressed debt but comes with safeguards to prevent defaulting promoters from reclaiming assets. RBI may impose additional compliance measures, Sebi said.So far, only deposit-taking NBFCs, systemically important non-deposit-taking NBFCs, infrastructure finance companies, and asset finance firms were allowed to buy security receipts.A committee led by Sudarshan Sen, formed by RBI in 2021 to review ARC regulations, had recommended expanding eligibility to all NBFCs and housing finance firms. It also proposed allowing high-net-worth individuals (Rs 1 crore+), corporates (Rs 10 crore+), trusts, family offices, pension funds, and distressed asset funds to invest.""Investment in security receipts can offer an alternative investment class with higher income yield. Small NBFC/HFC squeezed for margins can look at it as an investment option,"" says Hari Hara Mishra, chief executive of the Association of ARCs in India.

"Health premiums surge, some renewals take a hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/health-premiums-surge-some-renewals-take-a-hit/articleshow/118669212.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Health insurance premium costs have surged forcing some policyholders to either downgrade or drop out of their cover. 1 in 10 policyholders has missed out on renewals in this financial year. About 10% policyholders have seen their renewal costs rise by 30% or more this year - only half of them paid the full premium.Why are premiums soaring? Insurers say a worsening claims ratio (the percentage of claims to total premium collected) is behind the hikes.The reason why a section of policyholders see sharp hikes is that health premiums do not rise in a steady, predictable manner but tend to jump at intervals. Insurers typically adjust their rate schedules every three years to account for medical inflation - the rising cost of treatments. Premiums also increase with age, with sharper hikes in later years reflecting higher claims in older age groups.Over the last 10 years, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in premiums ranged between 5-10% for 52% of policyholders. This means that for more than half of them, a Rs 100 premium increased to Rs 162-259 after 10 years.For another 38%, CAGR in premiums ranged from 10-15%, translating to their Rs 100 premium rising to Rs 259-404 over the same period. However, 3% of policyholders saw their premiums rise with a CAGR of 15-30%.""The percentage of people who saw a very large price increase is very small. You have to look at what is happening in the context of medical inflation, which is close to 14%, while the average increase in premiums is much lower,"" said Amit Chhabra, chief business officer general insurance at Policybazaar. He adds that the 90% renewal is a 10% improvement from the previous year and the renewal ratio is trending upwards.A study by Policybazaar provides insights into India's evolving health insurance market, highlighting rising premiums, consumer strategies to mitigate costs, and the industry's response to increasing medical inflation. While some policyholders face sharp premium hikes, most are finding ways to manage expenses through new plan structures and cost-saving measures.""If there is a price increase, and I don't want to absorb that increase, then as a customer, I have the option to move to a slightly lower variant, which brings down the premium. Many people are also opting for deductibles when renewing their policies to reduce costs,"" said Chhabra. Besides medical inflation, and emergence of new tech, there is also widening of the scope of cover in health insurance.",1 in 10 policyholders has missed out on renewals in this financial year. 10% policyholders have seen their renewal costs rise by 30% or more this year.

BENGALURU: India's technology sector expanded its workforce by 1.2 lakh people in 2024-25, with global capability centres (GCCs) accounting for over 1 lakh of these roles. It is significant that GCCs hired over 100,000 professionals during this period, up from 90,000 last year. Overall, the tech industry has 5.8 million employees.Through the first nine months of 2024-25, top Indian IT firms hired just 11,000 people. In fact, the top five Indian IT services organisations increased their workforce by only 5,190 employees during the 2023-24 financial year. TOI reported how this will be the second consecutive year where GCCs will surpass IT firms in net hiring.Even as India's tech sector is expected to become a $300 billion industry in the 2025-26, the last few years have seen business models become dynamic and outcome-based. For the first time, Nasscom highlighted an even distribution in export revenues of $224 billion between MNCs (including GCCs) and Indian IT firms, with each contributing $112 billion.The pendulum has swung from an employees' market to an employers' market, even as the IT sector's business model is undergoing a massive transformation, with AI disrupting the linear relationship between revenue and employment. The current scenario reflects a period when major IT companies are experiencing single-digit growth rates and workforce reductions, while GCCs contributed significantly to employment growth in the previous year.At the recent Nasscom Technology & Leadership Forum (NTLF), HCL CEO C Vijayakumar said if the IT services industry is ""paranoid"" about the change like an ""existential threat,"" it will come out winners in the long term.Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar told TOI recently that with machines writing 20% of the code, teams can accomplish more tasks with fewer personnel. This, Kumar said, creates an interesting economic scenario known as Jevons Paradox, where increased efficiency in resource usage leads to higher overall demand for that resource. In AI's case, the efficiency it brings is enabling a lot more to be accomplished using AI, thereby increasing its use.Kumar said GCCs are not adversaries, and Cognizant is beginning to work actively with them to do some parts of their work. He said he has set up a team to cater to GCCs.Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a tech growth advisory firm, said, ""It's akin to the tale of two cities. The past year was another year of tepid growth for major IT services companies and of outsized growth for GCCs, resulting in the net hiring by GCCs being substantially higher for the second year in a row,"" he said.Nasscom president Rajesh Nambiar believes IT firms and GCCs complement each other and can benefit from this synergy.","India's technology sector expanded its workforce by 1.2 lakh people in 2024-25.

Mahindra beats Hyundai in car sales & revenue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mahindra-beats-hyundai-in-car-sales-revenue/articleshow/118668603.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mahindra & Mahindra has not only clinched the Number 2 slot in sales of passenger vehicles, but the demand for its premium off-roaders has also meant that the company has moved ahead of Korean Hyundai in revenue market share while getting the crown of the largest SUV seller in the country.Powered by sale of SUVs such as Scorpio-N, Thar, XUV7OO and XUV3XO, Mahindra's revenue in April-Jan 2024-25 stood at nearly Rs 71,000 crore, much ahead of Hyundai's Rs 58,653 crore and that of others like Toyota (Rs 51,945 crore) and Tata Motors (Rs 48,976 crore), according to the data accessed from research firm Jato. Only Maruti, the largest PV player, leads the segment with a revenue of over Rs 1.2 lakh crore.Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director & CEO of Mahindra's automotive and farm divisions, said the company has a clear focus on maintaining its volume and value leadership in SUVs, while driving in new ""adventure-ready"" off-roaders. ""For us, revenue market share is a more critical metric, and so is having the top position in SUVs. And in this process, if we also become the No. 2 PV player during certain periods, that's clearly an added bonus for us,"" Jejurikar told TOI.According to JATO, while Maruti leads the PV revenue market with a share of 30%, Mahindra comes in second with 17%, Hyundai third with 14%, Toyota fourth with 12.5%, and Tata Motors fifth with 12% (in ten months of this fiscal).In Jan this year, Mahindra emerged as the second-largest PV seller (behind only Maruti Suzuki) as it sold 50,420 units against 47,727 sold by Hyundai. Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai India, said the company expects demand to come back following income tax relaxation given in the Union Budget. ""Despite geopolitical challenges, we remain optimistic that the proposed tax reforms in the Budget and improved liquidity will provide the much-needed demand boost.""Mahindra has clearly gained from the growing demand for SUVs, especially as the company refreshed its aging fleet at a time when the positive trend started to build up for off-roaders. Rapidly-developing highways, better inter-city connectivity, and changing lifestyle trends have fuelled the demand for SUVs, giving them a share in excess of 50%.","Mahindra's revenue in April-Jan 2024-25 stood at nearly Rs 71,000 crore.

Lara Trump: We have 'serious' health ground to make up

Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of US President Donald Trump is facing backlash after discussing health and wellness on her Fox News show, My View with Lara Trump , while critics pointed out her alleged cosmetic procedures.In the latest episode, aired on Saturday, Trump promoted the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, praising Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s controversial views on health. “Clearly, we have serious ground to make up,” she said, while blaming Democrats for failing to address health issues. “And yet, those on the left are more focused on fear-mongering and attacking RFK rather than working together.”However, viewers took to social media to call out the perceived hypocrisy of Trump discussing health while allegedly undergoing cosmetic enhancements. One viewer on X wrote, “So watching the Lara Trump show, she has a Mom on talking about the MAHA movement/health issues. Meanwhile both Lara & Kristin have faces full of plastic and injected lips. Kinda hypocritical to lecture us about health while you’re injecting plastics/toxins in your face.”During the episode, Trump visited biohacker Gary Brecka, who shared various longevity techniques, including the benefits of owning a hyperbaric chamber and using red light therapy. She participated in a three-minute ice plunge and observed Brecka’s special Wi-Fi-free bed, meant to improve sleep quality.Speculation over Lara Trump's appearanceAccording to Express US, Trump’s appearance has been a topic of discussion for years, with speculation about possible plastic surgery. After her Fox News debut, criticism resurfaced. “What in the horse face happened to Lara Trump?” one user posted on X. Another asked, “What has Lara Trump done to her face? Did she have plastic surgery? New cheek bones? She was pretty.”This isn’t the first time Trump’s looks have drawn attention. During Donald Trump’s 2017 inauguration, people speculated about her cosmetic enhancements. Express US noted one comment: “Most [women] look worse after plastic surgery. Just look at literally all the Trump women.” Another person asked, “What’s up with Lara Trump’s eyes???”Fox News and Lara Trump’s new showTrump’s show, which debuted on February 22, features interviews with conservative figures, including Trump administration officials such as Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. In an interview with Time Magazine, she suggested that her presence on Fox News signaled a renewed connection between the network and Donald Trump. “I certainly hope they can take me being on the team at Fox as a very clear indication as to where Fox stands,” she said.Fox News has historically supported Donald Trump, though the network distanced itself after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The former president later criticized the network in November 2022. Despite this, Fox News remains influential among conservative audiences.","Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of US President Donald Trump is facing backlash after discussing health and wellness on her Fox News show.

Harvard International Review removes article criticising Khalistan movement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-international-review-removes-article-criticising-khalistan-movement/articleshow/118659737.cms,"Representative AI Image by Denny (left), Khalistan Protest file photo by ANI (right)

The Harvard International Review (HIR) removed an article critical of the Sikh separatist Khalistan movement on February 22, following backlash from Sikh readers, including a complaint from Harvard’s Sikh chaplain .The article by Sophia King and Anneliese S Mattox published on February 15, titled “A Thorn in the Maple: How the Khalistan Question is Reshaping India-Canada Relations,” said that the movement lacked widespread support and echoed Indian government allegations that key leaders were terrorists.The decision to take down the article sparked controversy, with its author, Zyna Dhillon ’28, refusing to make requested edits. “I think the HIR buckled down under pressure and the decision to remove the article was, in my opinion, a knee-jerk reaction,” Dhillon wrote in a statement.HIR’s editors-in-chief, Sydney C Black ’27 and Elizabeth R Place ’27, defended their decision, stating that the article would not be reinstated unless Dhillon made “necessary” changes.They cited concerns over neutrality, calling the article an “opinionated style of journalism rather than the analytical reporting HIR has published for nearly 50 years.”The Khalistan movement, which seeks a separate Sikh state in Punjab, peaked in the 1970s and 1980s but remains strong among segments of the Sikh diaspora. Dhillon’s article argued that Sikh nationalism in Canada has strained India-Canada relations. The issue gained renewed attention after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused “agents of the government of India” of assassinating Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in 2023, a claim India denied.On February 16, a day after the article’s publication, HIR editors reached out to Dhillon, citing a reader’s concern that the piece focused on Khalistani violence without adequately addressing its suppression. The editors suggested Dhillon add context but did not threaten removal. However, on February 22, they informed her that the article was taken down following a four-page complaint from Harvard Sikh chaplain Harpreet Singh.Singh criticised Dhillon’s argument as “a dangerous equivalency” that conflated “all Khalistan activism with ‘terrorism’” and accused her of relying on Indian government data while downplaying support for Khalistan. HIR editors then asked Dhillon to remove Indian government statistics on militant violence and add details about alleged harassment of Indian diplomats in Canada.Dhillon rejected the proposed changes and said that some edits—such as adding that “India defines terrorism broadly”—would have “actively pandered to the pro-Khalistan critics of the article.” She argued that HIR’s editorial interventions came in response to complaints rather than independent scrutiny of her work.“They seem to think that me presenting the Khalistan movement in a certain way is a matter of my opinion, rather than what is like the actual situation on the ground,” Dhillon said.Black and Place stated that HIR is implementing “stronger editorial checks on all reporting” and expanding its faculty advisory network “to deepen our expertise on complex regional issues.”","The Harvard International Review removed an article critical of the Sikh separatist Khalistan movement on February 22.

"Jeffrey Epstein files: Justice department releases Jeffrey Epstein files, but critics say they lack new revelations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/classified-or-declassified-justice-department-releases-jeffrey-epstein-files-but-critics-say-they-lack-new-revelations/articleshow/118614418.cms,"Conservative commentators outside White House with “The Epstein Files: Phase 1”

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday released a set of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender. Conservative influencers exiting the White House were seen carrying white binders labeled ""The Epstein Files: Phase 1,"" featuring the DOJ seal, and some held them up for cameras. The release came after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was confirmed earlier this month, had pledged to make files public, including flight logs and names of individuals involved. However, she had cautioned that certain information would remain undisclosed to protect over 250 victims.Despite the anticipation surrounding the release, the DOJ later acknowledged that the files contained little new information. A review of the documents found them heavily redacted and largely composed of details that had already been publicly reported. While the binders were marked ""declassified,"" it remained unclear whether they had ever been classified in the first place.The limited scope of the release led to criticism, even from some Republicans. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency, voiced her disappointment, stating, ""I nor the task force were given or reviewed the Epstein documents being released today … A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein’s phonebook. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!""The manner of the release also sparked controversy online, as the DOJ provided access to the files to a select group of conservative commentators, including Rogan O’Handley (DC Draino), Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, podcaster Liz Wheeler, and Jack Posobiec, among others. By Thursday evening, the files had not been made available to DOJ reporters or posted publicly online, leading to criticism that the rollout resembled the 'Twitter Files'—the selective disclosure of internal Twitter communications by Elon Musk to independent journalists in 2022-23.Social media users questioned why the DOJ had chosen to distribute the documents exclusively to certain influencers rather than making them accessible to the general public. “Trump did exactly what I was afraid of, just like Elon did with the 'Twitter Files.' The Epstein files should have been released on a website to the public, not just to a few select people. Any of these ‘influencers’ who don’t immediately scan and publicly post the entire binder will have outed themselves as a grifting gatekeeping POS,” one person wrote on X.Another commenter stated, ""Not blackpilling, but today's Epstein stunt is unfortunately delegitimizing and a poor attempt at recreating some kind of 'Twitter Files' type exposé. We have all the power now, so we don’t need influencers to leak stuff. Use the government. That’s why we put you in power.""The criticism highlighted concerns over transparency and the selective nature of the document distribution. Many argued that the DOJ should have published the files on an official government website, rather than allowing certain influencers to control how and when the information was shared. “This smells like the Twitter Files again. Select individuals receive the information and decide how to release it. Create a link on a government website and every American can access and review it. Why the gatekeeping? I hope I am wrong,” another user wrote.Epstein’s criminal history has been well-documented over the years, with multiple lawsuits, police reports, and public disclosures outlining his abuse of underage girls, some as young as 14. His crimes allegedly involved high-profile figures, including politicians, celebrities, and royalty. His death in 2019, ruled a suicide while awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail, only fueled speculation and calls for greater transparency regarding his connections and the extent of his criminal network.In January 2024, a court unsealed a significant batch of documents from a lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre. The materials included police reports and victim testimonies that had already been widely circulated. Bondi, in her interview with Fox News ahead of the document release, hinted at their contents but stopped short of confirming whether they would contain new revelations beyond what was already known.The DOJ’s move to release the files was framed as part of its commitment to transparency. However, with many of the materials already publicly available and key details redacted, critics—both online and in Congress—expressed disappointment, arguing that the public deserved full disclosure rather than a controlled release through select individuals.","The US Department of Justice on Thursday released a set of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.

Trump's crypto play: A game changer or just a market jolt?

Unanswered questions: How will the crypto reserve work?

US President Donald Trump shook up the cryptocurrency world on Sunday, announcing that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve . The move sent all three assets surging between 10% and 35% in market trading, reported Reuters.Trump revealed the decision in a social media post, tying it to his January executive order on digital assets. “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World,” he declared, adding that his directive instructed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the reserve plan.The announcement marks a sharp policy shift from the Biden administration, which had cracked down on the crypto industry over concerns about fraud and money laundering. Trump's 2024 campaign, in contrast, won significant backing from crypto executives, and his latest move signals that he intends to deliver on his pro-crypto promises.While the news initially sparked a rally, broader cryptocurrency markets have struggled in recent weeks, with many digital assets erasing their post-election gains. Analysts believe a more sustained market boost will require either interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve or a clearer regulatory framework from the Trump administration.Despite the excitement, details about the crypto reserve remain unclear. Some experts speculate it could be funded through the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is traditionally used to manage foreign currencies. Others suggest it might involve cryptocurrencies seized in law enforcement actions.Legal scholars are divided on whether the reserve could be established without congressional approval. Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is pressing ahead—his family has even launched its own cryptocurrency, and the first-ever White House Crypto Summit is set for Friday.With the administration doubling down on its pro-crypto stance, all eyes are now on Washington to see whether Trump’s bold move is the start of a new financial era or just another short-lived market shake-up.","US President Donald Trump announced Sunday that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve.

"Tesla sets sights on Waymo, Uber in California ride-hail bid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-sets-sights-on-waymo-uber-in-california-ride-hail-bid/articleshow/118656189.cms,"Tesla

Different business models

Tesla Inc. is seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, a key step by Elon Musk’s company to begin carrying paying customers while its traditional car-selling business falters.The electric vehicle manufacturer applied late last year for what’s known as a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, according to documents viewed by Bloomberg. That classification means Tesla would own and control the fleet of vehicles.The previously unreported application suggests Tesla is working to launch a promised ride-hailing business in the near term, opening a new revenue stream and putting it in competition with the likes of Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc. and Waymo. Musk has said Tesla would roll out driverless ride-hailing in Austin in June and aimed to offer it in California by the end of the year, without offering specific details.Shares of Uber briefly turned negative on the news and were trading up less than 1% as of 12.57 p.m. in New York. Lyft also pared gains. Tesla was little changed.Musk has made a big bet on autonomous driving , robotics and artificial intelligence as the primary business of selling EVs struggles. Tesla recently posted its first annual sales decline in over a decade, and the first quarter shows signs of sluggishness in key markets such as the US and Europe.In its communications with California officials, Tesla discussed driver’s license information and drug-testing coordination, suggesting the company intends to use human drivers, at least initially. Tesla is applying for the same type of permit used by Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s robotaxi business. While Tesla has approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California, it doesn’t have, nor has applied for, a driverless testing or deployment permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, according to a spokesperson.It wasn’t immediately clear whether Tesla would obtain the California Public Utilities Commission permit or when the service might start. A spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Tesla’s application “is pending and not yet public.”Casey Blaine, Tesla’s senior regulatory counsel, didn’t respond to requests from Bloomberg for comment. Several other Tesla employees who are involved in the effort also didn’t respond to inquiries.A ride-hailing business with human drivers could pave the way for Tesla to introduce robotaxi service in California, where Waymo already operates a driverless fleet in San Francisco.There are different permitting requirements and operating rules for each business model — Uber and Lyft allow drivers to use their personal vehicles, unlike Waymo — and the state’s stricter demands on autonomous vehicles have tripped up some companies. Cruise had its license suspended in California after an incident that injured a pedestrian, and parent General Motors Co. later folded the operations while abandoning the robotaxi market.Musk has talked for years about operating a Tesla fleet without human drivers. Tesla does not currently have a fully autonomous vehicle on the market, but it offers driver-assistance systems that control some functions while an alert human remains behind the wheel.Tesla unveiled a prototype in October of its forthcoming driverless Cybercab. Musk has said the company will roll out its ride-hailing service initially using existing vehicle models, which would include the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV.Musk recently addressed ride-hailing preparations, saying that there was “a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works efficiently,” including ensuring that the payment system and app functionality operate as intended.Tesla’s path to launching robotaxi service is clearer in Texas, where autonomous driving is regulated much like any other vehicle. Its vehicles will be required to have cameras and be able to follow traffic laws and have insurance.The company will also need a ride-share license with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. As of early February, the company had not had communication with the department, according to a records request. Tesla is also not currently listed as a ride-share licensee on the department’s website.Uber is preparing to launch autonomous rides with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta this year. Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said this month that he had had conversations with Musk, but that the Tesla CEO decided not to put its vehicles on Uber’s platform.","Elon Musk has said Tesla would roll out driverless ride-hailing in Austin in June and aimed to offer it in California by the end of the year.

Bitcoin slides from all-time high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-slides-from-all-time-high/articleshow/118655668.cms,"Trump trade woes

A week-long rout in Bitcoin deepened amid the recent broader retreat from risky assets in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and crypto sector turmoil, marking a dramatic reality check for one of the most popular Trump trades.The original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday, bringing its decline from the all-time high reached less than six weeks ago to 28%. Bitcoin later pared the loss, and ended up trading little changed on the day. Bitcoin fell around 18% in February, the biggest monthly drop since June 2022.“Some large players just said at the end of the day, ‘you know what, I’m just going to throw in the towel,” said Zaheer Ebtikar, co-founder of crypto fund Split Capital. “I think that’s what we saw this past week. There was definitely a lot of selling more than usual, so it’s hard to pinpoint one specific exchange or place.”This week’s drop in Bitcoin has taken it to technical levels that many traders watch for signs that the selloff may have gone too far, inspiring dip buyers to step in and at least pause the declines. Bitcoin has fallen below its 200-day moving average, a closely watched indicator of the long-term trend, for the first time since October. Its 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of price momentum, this week fell below a level indicating the asset is considered oversold for the first time since September.Trump said Thursday that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would come into force from March 4, undermining hopes he might reverse course after a previous delay. He also said Chinese imports would face a further 10% levy, prompting officials in Beijing to promise “all necessary measures” in response.The focus on trade tensions had led to a broad risk-off decline across markets on Friday, pushing down almost all Asian stock markets and fueling declines in Europe. But cryptocurrencies — which are deeply exposed to shifts in risk appetite — were among the worst hit.The selloff underscores a swift change of fortunes for what was previously one of the most popular Trump trades in global markets: buying Bitcoin on the expectation that the president’s crypto-friendly approach would lead to a broad rally.That worked for a while. Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $109,241 on Jan. 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. But cryptocurrencies have recently come under pressure amid worries that Trump’s pugilistic approach to global trade could lead to broad pain.“Given the macro environment, it’s not surprising to see we are where we are,” said Stefan von Haenisch, director of over-the-counter trading in Asia Pacific at crypto custody firm Bitgo Inc. Traders are still waiting for Trump to come up with concrete steps for the sector including a Bitcoin stockpile, he said.Investors are now being forced to consider quite how far the world’s biggest cryptocurrency can fall. There is support for the coin around $70,000, said Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler, pointing to technical analysis. But he said investors shouldn’t assume the rout in Bitcoin will get that bad.“We will only see this level if negative sentiment dominates the equity markets,“ said Lienkha.Bearish sentiment has also hit spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds . Investors have pulled a record $3.3 billion from US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in February, poised for the biggest monthly exodus since they debuted, as investors sought refuge in safer assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and persistent inflation concerns.Trump has already made a few changes that have pleased crypto bulls, including putting crypto advocates in key positions. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which embarked on a yearslong crackdown under former Chair Gary Gensler, has also closed investigations into several crypto outfits in recent weeks.Trump has said he wants to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.”","The original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday. Bitcoin fell around 18% in February, the biggest monthly drop since June 2022. The selloff underscores a swift change of fortunes for what was previously one of the most popular Trump trades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118655688,imgsize-733116,width-400,resizemode-4/118655688.jpg"

Many analysts believe these factors are pushing investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.After a strong run in the markets, sentiment took a hit this week when Trump confirmed that a 25 per cent tariff on Mexico and Canada would take effect on 4 March, with an additional 10 per cent levy on China to follow.Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $109,241 on 20 January, the day of Trump’s inauguration, but has since plunged almost 25 per cent as traders unwind bets placed on the back of his election.The sell-off gained momentum during Friday’s Asian trading session, driven by growing concerns over Trump’s aggressive trade policies and broader economic instability. His pledges to slash taxes and immigration also raised fears of renewed inflation, which could compel the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated.","The world’s largest digital asset dropped to $79,525.88 during early Asian trading on Friday.

Adding to their pain is the tightening of post-education work visa norms, which dims chances of higher pay abroad and repay loan sooner back home.In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug. That's an increase of Rs 5 lakh on a Rs 1-crore tuition-plus-expenses budget.At the same time, the UK has proposed requiring international graduates to secure graduate-level jobs with salaries between 36,000-40,000 pounds to stay beyond two years. Canada too is tightening immigration rules for Indian students, by allowing officials to cancel permits and ending the Student Direct Stream visa program.""Earlier, students used the post-education work visa to earn in dollars and repay a large part of their loans. For Indian students in undergraduate programs, the impact could be severe as their total cost of education is in excess of Rs 1.5 crore in the US,"" said Ajay Bohora, co-founder of education loan company HDFC Credila.This means either a longer repayment period or higher EMIs on their education loans , said Bohora. The weak rupee also increases costs for students flying back. According to Bohora, the higher financial burden on families will require students to be more frugal.""I am now sending $800 a month instead of $900 for my daughter's food & board in the US. Govt has, on top of that, put TCS, which is an additional burden. So, on my tax-paid money, I am paying tax for the second time via TCS. Though I can get a refund, it has blocked my tax-paid money for a year,"" said Sudha Pai, a Mumbai resident.""While fluctuations are a regular phenomenon, this year there has been a huge upward rise in the dollar. Coupled with the uncertainty caused by the political scenario in the wake of elections, the impact on overseas education has been huge,"" said K P Singh, an education counsellor & founder, Institute of Management & Foreign Studies.According to Karan Gupta, a career counsellor, parents can 'lock in' foreign exchange rates by getting a loan sanctioned early and transferring funds to the university account to hedge against depreciation. ""Students should avoid foreign currency loans, as it would be more expensive to repay when they return to India. They should also apply to universities that offer financial aid and scholarships, thereby reducing their financial burden,"" said Gupta.Bohora attributes the restrictions on student work visas to ""economic patriotism,"" which is on the rise in the US, the UK, and Canada.The US has signalled its intent to attract highly skilled global talent to drive technological innovation and economic growth. Indian students who want to pursue higher education in the US would have to explore emerging fields such as GenAI, cybersecurity, distributed finance, blockchain, and digital currencies to enhance job prospects.According to Singh, students should not focus solely on traditional fields like coding and programming but should explore new-age areas. He added that those without the financial resources should not take risks by pursuing courses with limited employment potential.","In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug.

Sahil Bloom with family

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

In a semi-kayfabe culture of productivity hacks and KPIs, Sahil Bloom has some real insights. The investor, entrepreneur, and author sits across from me in his office, occasionally glancing at what I imagine is a meticulously structured calendar. His recent book, “The 5 Types of Wealth,” has been gaining traction not just in business circles but among a broader audience seeking a more comprehensive approach to success.“Money is an enabler, not a goal,” Bloom states with conviction early in our conversation. It's a sentiment that might sound trite coming from someone else, but Bloom's background in finance and investing lends the observation a certain gravitas. “What gets measured gets managed,” he continues, referencing Peter Drucker . “Money's measurability means that for most people, that's the only thing they focus on and optimize around.”This observation forms one pillar of Bloom's philosophy: We've been measuring the wrong things. Through his research and conversations with successful individuals, Bloom identified four recurring themes that contribute to a fulfilling life: time, people, purpose, and health. The financial component, while important, serves primarily as an enabler rather than an end in itself.“A big part of the book, and the entire idea, is that we need to measure the bigger picture of what really matters in building a fulfilling life,” he explains. “These other things in addition to money. Money is not nothing. It simply can't be the only thing.”When pressed about the three most important decisions that shape our lives—where to live, who to be with romantically, and what to do professionally—Bloom resists offering prescriptive advice. “It's very hard for me to tell you what you should care about.” Instead, he emphasizes the meta-perspective: creating space to ask these questions in the first place. “You need to stop and pause and create the space necessary to come to your own answers for them,” he insists. “That is what's important. It's not someone telling you 'here are the answers.' It's that you are given and allowed and pushed to create the space to ask them in the first place.”This approach reflects Bloom's belief that self-awareness is paramount in decision-making. But how does one distinguish between authentic desires and mimetic ones—those we've absorbed from our environment? Bloom references a conversation with his friend Derek Thompson , a writer at The Atlantic: “Do you want the job, or do you want other people to see you have this job?”He elaborates: “Would you take that job or buy that thing if no one else in the world would figure out or find out that you had it? Would you still want to do it? That's a really good way of cutting through the noise.”I also asked Bloom about the evergreen skills that will remain valuable regardless of technological advances. His answer is immediate and confident.“I think the two skills that will continue to matter no matter what are storytelling and sales,” he says. “Storytelling and sales are fundamentally everything when it comes to your life. The CEOs of the biggest companies in the world are not the smartest people at their organizations. They are the best storytellers.”This perspective challenges conventional thinking about technical expertise. “Ten years ago, you would have said software engineering is such a durable skill. Well, I could create a case where software engineering is a totally obsolete skill because of AI in ten years,” Bloom observes. “What that means is that the meta-skills are what really matter.”But how does one become a good storyteller? Per Bloom, it's about deliberate practice and acute observation. “Every single time I talk about anything, I am paying attention to the things that are making your eyes light up. I'm paying attention to the things that are making you lean in. I'm paying attention to the things where you look confused,” he explains. “Every single time you are telling your story, you should be gathering information and data to make your story even better the next time you do it.”Perhaps the most striking aspect of my conversation with Bloom is his unwavering commitment to delayed gratification. In an era of instant validation, though, his approach seems almost ancient (and wise).“I fundamentally believe that delayed gratification is the key to life,” he states with remarkable certainty. “Delayed gratification is effectively the cheat code that allows you to build the life that you want.”This philosophy manifests in his daily routine and work ethic. “If all I have to do to provide for my family is wake up at 4am every single day, I have to be able to get myself up and do that,"" he says, his voice taking on an edge of intensity. “It doesn't matter how I feel, because if I followed how it felt on a daily basis, I would never get started on anything.”This willingness to override short-term discomfort for long-term gain permeates Bloom's thinking about relationships as well. “Marriage is sacrificing short-term freedom in order to achieve long-term freedom of a fulfilling, happy life,” he observes. “That is really the fundamental trade-off that we constantly come into tension with.”In between our discussion on productivity and discipline, Bloom endorses boredom. In our hyper-stimulated world, he sees deliberate periods of non-stimulation as essential.“Create space to retreat, to pause, to create solitude for yourself,” he advises. “This is like the hidden life hack that no one talks about—that you need to have a boredom ritual in your life.”Bloom cites Pascal: “Blaise Pascal said all of humanity's problems come from the inability to sit in a room alone, and that's very true.” For Bloom, these periods of boredom aren't extensive—""probably like 15 minutes a day of true boredom”—but they're non-negotiable. “It's very uncomfortable when you first do it because you're so unused to zero stimulation. The only time you ever have zero stimulation is when you're in the shower, and it's no wonder that you have your best ideas there.”This approach to intentional boredom connects to his journaling practice, which again reflects Bloom's pragmatic nature. Rather than lengthy introspection, he employs what he calls the “1-1-1 method”: “Three minutes, and you write down one win from the day, something you feel good about; one point of stress or tension, something you're stressed about; and then one point of gratitude, something that you were grateful for during the day. Takes literally two to three minutes, and you never have an excuse to not do it.”The primary benefit? Better sleep. “I fall asleep much more quickly. I feel way less anxious when I get into bed because I got that thing off my brain and onto the paper.”Bloom also offers a perspective on relationships that aligns with his long-term thinking. “I approach every single new relationship with a question: If I were to assume that I am going to know this person for the next 50 years, how would I approach this relationship, this first meeting?”The answer reflects his non-transactional philosophy: “I wouldn't ask for anything, for sure. I would probably just try to really understand a person and start to go deep and understand who this person is, what their motivations are, what they're all about. People that approach life quid pro quo and approach things in a transactional way very rarely achieve the best outcomes in life.”His approach to maintaining relationships is similarly intuitive rather than systematic. “I don't have a CRM. I just do everything off of feel. When I think something about someone, I just send them the text, and I do it right then, because I think that inspiration around relationships is very perishable.”As our time draws to a close, I ask Bloom what people most commonly misunderstand about building a fulfilling life. His answer crystallizes the philosophy that underpins his book and worldview.“The single biggest mindset shift people need to have is to recognize that investments in all of these areas of your life compound in the same way as financial investments,” he says with particular emphasis. “We don't think that way. We don't think about investments in relationships compounding. We don't think about investments in our health or in our purpose as compounding, but they do.”This insight leads to the final one: “Anything above zero compounds. Doing a tiny bit today—sending the one text, going for the 15-minute walk—all of those things are better than doing nothing. Anything above zero compounds. That mindset will change your life.”In a world fragmented by competing metrics and definitions of success, Bloom’s approach suggests that fulfillment may lie not in the grand gestures but in small, consistent actions across multiple dimensions of wealth—actions whose value, like compound interest, becomes apparent only with the passage of time.","Sahil Bloom is an investor, entrepreneur, and author.

Buffett’s assurance on cash reserves

Big bets on Japan’s trading giants

Berkshire Hathaway’s outlook

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has reassured shareholders regarding Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial cash reserves, signaling that the funds will be strategically deployed to fuel future growth.Addressing concerns about the company’s massive $321.4 billion cash pile, Buffett, in his annual letter to shareholders, dismissed speculations that it signals an impending economic downturn. He emphasized his plans to make significant investments, particularly in one major emerging market.Despite the growing cash reserves, Buffett clarified that Berkshire Hathaway’s focus remains firmly on equity investments. He explained that while the firm’s cash reserves have reached unprecedented levels, the majority of Berkshire’s value remains tied up in equities, with no intention to shift away from this strategy. As of the last quarter, Berkshire had refrained from stock buybacks for the second consecutive period, leading some analysts to speculate that Buffett didn’t see the company’s stock as undervalued. However, Buffett reassured that the company’s core preference for equities would not change.Buffett also revealed where some of this enormous cash reserve will be allocated. Berkshire Hathaway has already made significant investments in Japan, particularly in the country’s five largest trading houses: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. These companies, known as ""sogo shosha,"" are involved in diverse sectors ranging from commodities to shipping and steel. Buffett expressed confidence in these firms, citing their strong integration into Japan’s economy and their diversified business models, which closely mirror Berkshire Hathaway’s investment philosophy.Buffett indicated that Berkshire would likely increase its stake in these companies over time, noting that they had agreed to allow Berkshire to surpass the 9.9% ownership limit previously set. By the end of 2024, Berkshire’s holdings in these Japanese trading houses had reached $23.5 billion, with the potential for further growth. Buffett’s long-term vision for these investments reflects his strategy of investing in businesses he understands and trusts.Berkshire Hathaway’s total market value surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in 2024, a milestone that Buffett attributed to the company’s culture of long-term reinvestment and compounding returns. Despite a slight decline in profits, from $96.2 billion to $89 billion, Buffett encouraged investors to focus on operating earnings, which saw a significant rise from $37.4 billion to $47.4 billion in 2023.Buffett reiterated the importance of reinvesting Berkshire’s revenues, rather than paying dividends, which has yielded substantial returns over time. He credited the success of this approach to the power of compounding and sustained savings.","Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has reassured shareholders regarding Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial cash reserves.

Pi coin surges after Open Mainnet launch: Can it reach $100 or $500 by 2030?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pi-coin-surges-after-open-mainnet-launch-can-it-reach-100-or-500-by-2030/articleshow/118563592.cms,"Pi coin (Photo: ET)

Can Pi coin reach $100?

Will Pi Coin ever hit $500?

What’s Next for Pi Coin?

Pi Network officially launched its Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025, marking a shift from a closed ecosystem to full decentralization. The launch resulted in price fluctuations, with Pi Coin initially surging to $1.97, before dipping to $0.737, and then rebounding 80% to $1.29.As of February 24, 2025, Pi Coin is trading at around $1.55, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.18 billion.Despite still being far from the $10 mark, some crypto analysts believe Pi Coin has significant growth potential, especially if adoption increases and major exchanges begin listing it. OKX has already announced plans to enable Pi Coin trading once the network meets its listing criteria and completes a successful transition. Market experts suggest that for Pi Coin to hit the $100 mark, it will need robust demand, increased trading liquidity, and widespread adoption as a digital asset.Looking ahead, reports like those from Fortune India suggest that if Pi Network evolves into a widely accepted digital currency with real-world use cases, its price could potentially exceed $500 by 2030. However, this depends on various factors, including continuous development, mass adoption, and regulatory compliance. Analysts warn that Pi Coin's long-term growth could face challenges without strong real-world utility and developer engagement.Following its Open Mainnet launch , the focus now shifts to whether Pi Coin can maintain momentum and attract wider adoption. While this is a significant step forward, Pi Coin’s future will depend on its ability to build utility and trust among users and investors. The trajectory of Pi Coin will be influenced by how the network navigates challenges in a competitive and regulatory-heavy environment, ultimately determining whether it can surge towards $100, $500, or beyond.Disclaimer: Recommendations, views, and opinions expressed by experts are their own and do not reflect the views of The Times of India.","Pi Network officially launched its Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025.

That is possible. That's the prize. Getting it right is what we are here to do, and that's what we are working very hard towards"".Terming it a ""substantial"" agreement, he said these pacts make a ""real difference if you"" get them right.The negotiations are resuming after a gap of over eight months. The talks are happening following the UK general elections, which resulted in the Labour Party coming to power. The talks were launched on January 13, 2022.""I am very encouraged by the progress we have been able to make,"" Reynolds told PTI.The two countries are actively negotiating at three different fronts - FTA, bilateral investment treaty (BIT), and a Double Contribution Convention Agrement.""I gave assurances about the strengths of our commitment to the FTA and the investment treaty...,"" the UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade added.Further, he noted that the two economies are complementary in terms of services, and goods.""This (India) is such an important market for UK goods,"" he said adding huge demand is also there in the UK for Indian goods and services.Goyal has said that the agreement will be ""pathbreaking"" and would provide huge opportunities to grow ""our current USD 20 billion bilateral trade in merchandise to probably two or three times in the next 10 years"".He added that enthusiasm is there in both the countries about the FTA. ""Going forward, our trade relations will further strengthen.""In the FTA, India is looking for greater access for its students and professionals in the UK market, besides market access for several goods at nil customs duty.On the other hand, the UK is seeking a significant cut in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, electric vehicles, lamb meat, chocolates and certain confectionary items.Britain is also looking for more opportunities for UK services in Indian markets in segments like telecommunications, legal and financial services, including banking and insurance.The bilateral trade between India and the UK increased to USD 21.34 billion in 2023-24 from USD 20.36 billion in 2022-23. Britain is the sixth-largest investor in India. The country has received USD 35.3 billion FDI during April 2000 and September 2024.The negotiations for the trade pact come at a time when US President Donald Trump has announced imposing reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from America's all trade partners, including India.","India and the UK on Monday announced resumption of negotiations for the FTA.

Tesla unveils self-driving feature in China after long regulatory hurdles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-unveils-self-driving-feature-in-china-after-long-regulatory-hurdles/articleshow/118554100.cms,"Regulatory challenges and market expansion

China’s push for self-driving innovation

Tesla began rolling out advanced self-driving features for its cars in China, marking a milestone after years of regulatory hurdles in the world’s largest automobile market.In an announcement on its WeChat page on Tuesday, the US electric vehicle giant confirmed that a software update would gradually introduce ""automatic autopilot-assisted driving on city streets.""The update also included a rearview mirror function designed to detect whether drivers are paying attention.These features are similar to Tesla’s ""full self driving"" (FSD) capability available in the United States. However, the technology does not make vehicles fully autonomous and still requires driver supervision.Tesla stated that the update had already been released for some models and would be expanded to other compatible vehicles over time.China is a crucial market for Tesla, where it operates two factories and faces increasing competition from domestic manufacturers.The announcement comes shortly after Chinese automaker BYD, Tesla’s biggest rival in the country, revealed plans to introduce advanced self-driving technology across nearly all its models.Tesla has long been working to gain regulatory approval for FSD in China, a process complicated by strict data and privacy laws. CEO Elon Musk has visited the country multiple times in past years, allegedly to secure key data security clearances for Tesla’s locally produced vehicles.Chinese automakers and tech firms have invested heavily in self-driving technology, aiming to compete with industry leaders in the US. While fully autonomous cars are not yet available for purchase, China has approved multiple self-driving taxi services in major cities.In Wuhan, more than 500 driverless taxis operate as part of Baidu’s Apollo Go project, offering rides across large parts of the city.Meanwhile, BYD’s ""God’s Eye"" autonomous driving system, previously reserved for high-end vehicles, will soon be available in budget models priced under $10,000, further increasing competition in the market.As Tesla expands its self-driving capabilities in China, it faces an increasingly dynamic landscape where local companies are rapidly advancing their own autonomous technologies.","Tesla began rolling out advanced self-driving features for its cars in China.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

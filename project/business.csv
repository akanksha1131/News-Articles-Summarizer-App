Have you signed the updated locker agreement with your bank? If not, you are at the risk of losing your locker. Customers who have bank lockers face the risk of losing access if they fail to sign a revised rental agreement with their banks. Approximately 20% of locker renters could be denied access for not meeting regulatory timelines.The revised locker agreement now includes provisions allowing customers to seek legal remedies if banks fail to safeguard their locker contents.Banks are considering measures against non-compliant customers as the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) monitors compliance levels. Sources told ET that banks have approached both the regulator and government officials seeking authorisation to dispatch final notices and potentially seal lockers. These actions aim to ensure adherence to regulations whilst protecting banks from supervisory concerns.Currently, banks limit their actions to sending reminder notices to customers about agreement renewals. A government representative confirmed that they are reviewing the appeal from public sector banks.The RBI's updated guidelines for locker agreements required complete implementation by March 2024.In August 2021, RBI instructed banks to implement revised agreements with existing locker holders by January 1, 2023, considering technological advancements, customer complaints and feedback.Subsequently, RBI extended the implementation deadline to December 2023, followed by a further extension to March 2024.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted?

Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations:

Gold Price Weekly View: Volatile (1 – 2 Weeks)

Broad trading range on MCX futures (Aug CMP Rs 99,385) remains around Rs 97,200 - 1,02,500 per 10 gm

Meanwhile Silver is expected to trade with a positive bias as it may test Rs 1,10,000 - 1,13,000 per Kg on MCX (Aug) futures contract on the higher side in 1 - 2 weeks perspective.

Gold rate in India has seen a notable decrease across all purities and quantities in the last few days as higher prices have continued to dampen physical demand in India especially for jewellery. 24 Karat gold price could remain subdued in the near term amid lack of fresh demand cues in global markets.

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have been in focus for the last few days due to increased safe haven demand amidst the escalating Iran-Israel conflict. All eyes this week will be on the US Federal Reserve’s commentary on rate cut possibility. Gold prices are expected to remain volatile in the near future.Gold prices ended the last week with gains amid escalating Middle-East tensions & rising bets of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut. Investors ignored the upbeat US economic data released last week as geopolitical tensions remained the major focus of the current week.In other news, due to a combination of central bank gold buying & surging price of gold, the yellow metal overtook the euro as the world’s number two reserve asset as gold made up 19.6 percent of global reserves, with the Euro accounting for 15.9 percent.The survey carried out by World Gold Council expected 95% of respondents believing that global central bank gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months as a record 43% of respondents also believe that their own gold reserves will also increase over the same period and none anticipate a decline in gold holdings.In China, the recent US-China trade truce still faced challenges as military-use rare earth exports were unresolved. This remained after China refused to approve exports of specific rare earth metals used in US weapon systems, maintaining a chokepoint in the global supply chain.Focus this week to remain on any escalation in the middle east crisis, along with global central banks including US monetary policy meetings. The Bank of Japan had foregone another interest rate hike this year due to uncertainty over US tariff policy.However, all eyes remain on the June 18 Fed meeting, where the dot plot and Powell's tone may define gold’s path for the rest of 2025. US Policymakers are expected to monitor inflation through the coming months till September before considering any moves. Overall Markets continue to price in two rate cuts later this year, likely in the second half.On the other hand, traders may also closely monitor further rise in Oil prices which may keep Indian rupee under pressure keeping domestic prices elevated in near sessions. For Gold, a breach of all time high levels in spot markets cannot be completely ruled out in the coming week while volatility & profit booking moves could also persist at higher levels.

MUMBAI: Public sector banks lag their peers among private sector and foreign lenders in terms of accuracy, timeliness and consistency of data submitted for the purpose of supervision. However, they outperform in terms of completeness of data. Reserve Bank of India has started publishing the Supervisory Data Quality Index (sDQI) for scheduled commercial banks, with the first release covering the March 2024 and March 2025 quarters. The index, which evaluates the quality of regulatory data submissions based on accuracy, timeliness, completeness and consistency, improved to 89.3 in March 2025 from 88.6 a year earlier.Among bank groups, small finance banks topped the overall sDQI score at 90.6, followed by private sector banks at 89.6. Foreign banks and public sector banks reported overall scores of 89.1 and 88.8 respectively-both within the ""acceptable"" range of 80-90 as per RBI's benchmarks.Public sector banks recorded the highest score on data completeness (99.4), but lower marks in accuracy (85.7), timeliness (84.8) and consistency (85.2).The sDQI covers 87 scheduled commercial banks and assesses the quality of returns submitted for supervisory review, including those related to asset quality, liquidity, capital adequacy, and large credit exposures.

Income Tax Return e-filing: Can you keep switching between new and old tax regime every year?

Old vs New Tax Regime: Can you switch every year?

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): When filing your income tax return every year, the choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one. The new income tax regime offers lower tax rates and higher standard deduction compared to the old tax regime.On the flip side, the old tax regime allows for popular deductions and exemptions like Section 80C, 80D, House Rent Allowance (HRA), Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) and more.As your financial situation evolves over years, you may find it beneficial to be in the old regime versus the new or vice-versa. What if you opted for the new tax regime last year, but realise that for this year’s ITR filing the old tax regime results in lower tax outgo? A common question that taxpayers have is: can they choose between the new and old income tax regime every year, or is it a one time choice?Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted? Explained According to Sudhakar Sethuraman, Partner at Deloitte India, the Income-tax Act, 1961 allows individual taxpayers (who do not have business income) to choose between the regular (old) and simplified (new) tax regimes each financial year.“The choice of income tax regime is at the discretion of the individual and they can choose every year (provided they don’t have business income) depending on what is beneficial for them,” he tells TOI.Sudhakar Sethuraman goes on to explain, “Further, even if an individual had declared one tax regime to the employer for TDS purposes, he/she can change the choice of tax regime at the time of filing tax return (if he/she does not have business income).”It’s important to note that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime. In case you wish to file ITR under the old income tax regime, then you will have to opt for it. This can either be done at the start of the financial year by informing your employer, or at the time of filing the income tax return.Yet another fact that is of consequence is: you can opt for the old income tax regime at the time of ITR filing only if you file your tax return within the due date. Once the deadline to file ITR is crossed, you will automatically be switched to the new income tax regime.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Several changes in Form 16!

Gov Walz CONFIRMS Vance Boelter's ARREST After NFL Star Blames Him For 'Chaos' In State | WATCH

Suspect has been identified as Vance Boelter

Poll Should lawmakers receive increased security measures after such incidents? Yes, absolutely. No, they should manage without.





Minnesota authorities have arrested Vance Boelter, 57, the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, ending an intense two-day manhunt that left the state on edge.The suspect is also accused of wounding State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife Yvette in a separate attack at their Minneapolis suburban home. During both incidents, the assailant reportedly wore a rubber mask and posed as a law enforcement officer.Investigators discovered the suspect had compiled a notebook containing approximately 70 potential targets, including both lawmakers. Before fleeing one of the crime scenes, he allegedly opened fire on responding officers.The manhunt intensified Saturday night when SWAT teams converged on a residence in Plymouth, Minnesota, roughly 12 miles west of Minneapolis. The search expanded to Sibley County the following day, where authorities recovered the suspect's vehicle and hat, approximately an hour's drive from the attack sites.Prior to the shootings, Boelter exhibited suspicious behavior, including emptying his bank account and prepaying four months' rent – at $220 monthly – for a room he occasionally occupied in Minneapolis. The payment was made to David Carlson, who described himself as one of Boelter's closest friends since elementary school.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Minnesota authorities have arrested Vance Boelter, 57, the primary suspect in the fatal shooting of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark.

DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: Manoj Sharma doesn't fly by the book in the Kedarnath sector — he flies by sight, by wind, by instinct. ""We are flying in one of the world's most unforgiving regions with very little real-time weather support,"" he said. ""Operations in such large numbers are being conducted on pilot observation and visual reference. The weather is very unpredictable and changes very rapidly.""That reality, long known to those in the cockpit, now has the country's attention. In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents — two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage — all on the Kedar route. In one case, a Kestrel Aviation helicopter crash-landed near a road after a mechanical failure, injuring the pilot and damaging a vehicle.This is not an outlier year. In 2022, an Aryan Aviation chopper crashed near Kedarnath, killing seven. In 2023, Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) finance controller Amit Saini died after being struck by a tail rotor. And in 2013, a military rescue helicopter went down during flood relief, killing 20.The terrain is tough — but it is not the only challenge. The system built to manage it is, in many ways, still catching up to the traffic it supports.Pilgrimage flights have surged over the past decade, but the region lacks a dedicated air traffic control network.""There is no ATC control nor any weather station in these areas,"" said a veteran pilot. ""Flying in the narrow valley from Gaurikund to Kedarnath needs a lot of experience and safety awareness, as there are no landing sites on this stretch that can be used in an emergency or bad weather."" Another pilot added, ""There is no information provided on routes where major helicopter operations take place. Till such time these issues can't be addressed, these operations should immediately be stopped. ""This month, the civil aviation ministry suspended Aryan Aviation from Char Dham operations and grounded two TransBharat pilots who flew in unsuitable weather, suspending their licences for six months.UCADA — established by the state in 2013 to oversee civil aviation development and safety, including helipad infrastructure and coordination with private operators — has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review with all operators and setting up a command-and-control room to monitor real-time risks. DGCA has deployed officers to oversee safety, airworthiness and the functioning of the control centre.But many in the sector say these moves fall short. ""It seems there are no checks and balances in place,"" said one chopper operator. ""There is someone who replaced one inoperative part on a chopper with another inoperative part from another chopper to show that the part has been changed. Because of unscrupulous operators, conscientious operators and passengers are suffering.""Others point to a deeper culture of pressure and compromise. ""There have been five chopper crashes in the country within the last 1.5 months, which is the worst we have ever seen in helicopter operations in our country,"" said a senior pilot. ""Char Dham operations are one of the toughest... yet we still fly as if nothing needs fixing.""Another pilot was more direct: ""We need a complete stop on chopper operations for this yatra season. All stakeholders — owners, pilots, commercial, engineers, DGCA and UCADA — need to look within and change."" One added, simply, ""It's greed. That's what's driving this. Not safety.""","In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents. Two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage.

US Fed Meeting: Top Highlights & Takeaways

Recent economic indicators point towards sustained robust growth in economic activity, despite fluctuations in net exports affecting the data, the policy statement said.

US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

US Fed has forecasted higher inflation and lower US GDP growth. Officials at the Federal Reserve anticipate that inflation, based on their preferred measurement, will increase to 3% towards the end of this year, compared to 2.1% recorded in April.

Their projections indicate the unemployment rate will climb to 4.5%, up from the present rate of 4.2%.

The US GDP growth is expected to come down to 1.4% this year, showing a significant reduction from the previous year's 2.5%.

Labour market stability persists with low unemployment rates and steady employment conditions. Price levels continue to show moderate elevation, it said.

Whilst economic uncertainty has decreased, it still remains elevated. The Committee maintains vigilance regarding risks to both aspects of its dual mandate.

The Committee continues to evaluate incoming data's implications for economic prospects whilst determining suitable monetary policy stance. Should any risks surface that might hinder achieving the Committee's objectives, they stand ready to modify monetary policy accordingly. The evaluations encompass diverse factors, including labour market status, inflation metrics and expectations, alongside financial and global economic trends, the statement added.

US Fed Chair Defies Donald Trump

US Fed Meeting: The US Federal Reserve, led by chair Jerome Powell, kept interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, defying President Donald Trump ’s call for a rate cut.“In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the US Federal Reserve statement reads.The US central bank has maintained its key interest rate steady in the current year, ranging between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent. Market observers had widely anticipated that Fed officials will maintain their current position until inflation shows consistent signs of moderation.During the Federal Reserve's second day of meetings, Trump intensified his demands for interest rate cuts, directing criticism at Federal Reserve Chairman Powell whilst dismissing inflation concerns.""We have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed, he probably won't cut today,"" Trump remarked about Powell, making these comments just hours before the Federal Reserve's scheduled announcement.""We have no inflation, we have only success, and I'd like to see interest rates get down,"" he continued whilst speaking at the White House. ""Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself?""Inflation has shown a downward trend since January, and economic experts indicate that without elevated import duties, the Federal Reserve would be implementing further rate reductions.The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of Powell regarding borrowing costs, with Trump directly referring to the Fed chair as a ""numbskull"" for not implementing cuts. Additional administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have joined in advocating for rate reductions.Economists express concern when there is pressure on the Fed to reduce rates solely to decrease government interest payments, as this could compromise the Fed's congressional responsibility to maintain price stability and maximum employment.Trump has expressed dissatisfaction that the Fed maintains rates whilst other global central banks have decreased their borrowing costs, including those in Europe, Canada, and the UK. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan maintained its short-term rate at 0.5%, following a recent increase.The European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England have implemented rate reductions this year partly due to US tariffs affecting their economies. Meanwhile, the US economy remains predominantly robust, with low unemployment levels.","US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

Ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision later today, US President Donald Trump has fired a fresh salvo at the American central bank. The US President has called Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell 'stupid' for not cutting rates. This is not the first time that Trump has targeted the US Fed chairman.Last week, Donald Trump had posted on social media platform Truth Social, ""“CPI JUST OUT. GREAT NUMBERS! FED SHOULD LOWER ONE FULL POINT. WOULD PAY MUCH LESS INTEREST ON DEBT COMING DUE. SO IMPORTANT!!!”.The Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to maintain current interest rates on Wednesday whilst its officials evaluate indicators of economic slowdown and inflation risks stemming from US import duties and the intensifying Middle East situation.Federal Reserve officials have indicated their desire for greater certainty regarding the economy's direction towards either increased inflation or reduced growth before providing additional interest rate guidance, yet the possibility of both price increases and employment reduction continues to exist.The Fed, having established its reference interest rate between 4.25%-4.50% in December, has observed increasing uncertainty in economic prospects, particularly following Donald Trump's return to office in January and his subsequent transformation of US trade strategy through the introduction of substantial reciprocal tariffs.Although implementation of the tariffs has been postponed, the matter remains unresolved and continues to be monitored by US central bank officials.Petroleum prices have increased following Israel's strike on Iran and the ensuing missile exchanges between these regional adversaries, whilst indicators regarding employment, retail performance and other US economic metrics suggest a potential decline in growth.Despite Trump's implementation of a 10 per cent tariff on most US trading partners and higher duties on steel, aluminium and automobile imports in recent months, there hasn't been a significant increase in prices yet.This limited price impact can be attributed to Trump's decisions to delay or withdraw some of his most severe tariff measures, whilst businesses have managed costs by utilising their existing stock rather than immediately raising prices for consumers.The consumer price index showed a modest increase to 2.4 per cent year-on-year in May from 2.3 per cent in April, demonstrating the current minimal impact of these trade levies.However, economic analysts anticipate that it will take several months before the effects of tariffs become evident in consumer prices, and the Fed is taking a measured approach towards interest rate modifications.",US President has called Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell'stupid' for not cutting rates.

Brent crude fell 2.3% to $74.65. Crude has been volatile this week amid rising tensions in West Asia.Investor attention is now on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to hold interest rates steady. The key event will be the Fed's updated projections for inflation, economic growth, and policy rates. Analysts expect at least two rate cuts by end-2025, although recent spikes in oil prices have dampened expectations.""While rate cuts could lower borrowing costs for households and businesses, they also risk fuelling inflation, particularly with tariffs and geopolitical risks in play,"" analysts noted, as quoted AP.The Fed has paused its easing cycle this year after a single cut in late 2024, citing persistent inflation concerns. Inflation remains near the Fed’s 2% target, but economists warn that the full impact of Trump’s tariffs may still be unfolding.Economic signals were mixed on Wednesday. Jobless claims fell, hinting at fewer layoffs, but housing starts disappointed, suggesting that high mortgage rates are weighing on the construction sector.Solar energy stocks rebounded after Tuesday’s sharp selloff triggered by fears of a rollback in green energy tax credits.

We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" he wrote.These remarks pushed oil prices more than 4% higher on Tuesday amid fears that an escalation could disrupt crude supplies, especially through the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway responsible for around 20% of global oil transport, reported AFP.Analysts warned that any strike on Iranian nuclear sites could have severe regional consequences.""Washington's refuelling jets are already en route, and if Fordow gets hit, expect the Strait of Hormuz to become a maritime minefield, Houthi drones to swarm Red Sea shipping lanes, and every militia from Basra to Damascus to light up American forward outposts,"" said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management.Despite a slight pullback in oil prices on Wednesday, markets remain volatile. Asian equities mirrored investor anxiety: Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Manila, and Jakarta all posted losses, while Tokyo, Seoul, and Taipei saw modest gains.Wall Street's performance also weighed on sentiment. Weak US retail sales and an unexpected drop in factory output for May raised fresh concerns about the resilience of the American economy.However, the disappointing data bolstered speculation that the Federal Reserve may consider cutting interest rates later this year. While the Fed is expected to hold rates steady at the conclusion of its policy meeting Wednesday, investors are closely watching for revisions in its growth and inflation outlook amid growing geopolitical and economic uncertainties.KPMG senior economist Benjamin Shoesmith noted that the Fed would likely be cutting rates already were it not for the unpredictability surrounding tariffs and tensions in the Middle East.","Oil prices steadied on Wednesday following a sharp surge the previous day, triggered by fears of escalating US involvement in the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict.

The US federal reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged Wednesday after concluding its latest policy meeting, as officials weigh the impact of tariffs on inflation and assess broader economic signals.The central bank has maintained the benchmark lending rate at 4.25–4.50 per cent throughout the year. Analysts believe policymakers will continue with this cautious stance until inflation shows clear signs of cooling.While US President Donald Trump has imposed 10 per cent tariffs on most US trading partners and higher levies on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, these moves have yet to push up consumer prices significantly. This limited impact is partly due to delayed implementation of some tariffs and businesses relying on existing inventory to avoid immediate price hikes.In May, the consumer price index rose to 2.4 per cent year-on-year, slightly higher than April’s 2.3 per cent, suggesting that tariff effects have not fully materialised.Economists warn that it may take months for the full impact of tariffs to be reflected in consumer prices.As a result, the Fed is taking a ""wait-and-see"" approach to interest rate decisions.""The Fed would no doubt be cutting again by now if not for the uncertainty regarding tariffs and a recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East,"" said KPMG senior economist Benjamin Shoesmith.Policymakers are also focused on keeping inflation expectations “anchored”. If consumers and businesses begin to anticipate higher prices, inflation could become self-reinforcing through increased wage demands and higher costs.On Wednesday, the Fed will also release updated economic projections covering GDP growth , unemployment, and inflation. Analysts are watching to see whether the Fed still expects two rate cuts this year.Despite repeated calls from Trump for lower interest rates, including public criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell, officials have reiterated the Fed’s independence and commitment to data-driven decision-making.Trump has argued that rate cuts would help reduce interest payments on government debt, but economists point out that lower rates typically increase consumer prices.Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, said Powell is unlikely to be swayed by political pressure, citing continued consumer spending and job creation. ""Certainly, the health of the economy doesn't beg for the Fed to cut rates,"" he said, ""so we think they're on hold till the end of the year.""",The US federal reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged Wednesday after concluding its latest policy meeting.

About Regencell Bioscience Holdings: The Stock That Rose 46,000%

Imagine a stock rising a whopping 46,000%, when the company makes no revenue! As unbelievable as it sounds, that’s the case for a herbal medicine biotech company. The shares of Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited have jumped by a mind-boggling 46,000% in 2025, despite having no revenue generation since its establishment!The Hong Kong-based organisation, which began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market in 2021, has witnessed an inexplicable 460-fold increase in 2025, despite minimal corporate announcements. According to its latest annual SEC filing, the company remains in its research and development phase, having generated no revenue since its inception.According to a Bloomberg report, Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited has transformed from a penny stock in April to achieve a market value of approximately $30 billion. The company's market capitalisation stood at merely $53 million a year ago. The firm reported a net loss of $4.4 million for the fiscal year ending June 2024, which is a 28% reduction compared to the previous period.The company's board sanctioned a 38-for-1 stock split in early 2025. Following the split's implementation on Monday, the share price rose by 283%, marking its highest single-day increase in nearly a year and triggering multiple trading halts due to volatility.The company has primarily sustained its operations through shareholder loans and IPO proceeds, as per the SEC documentation. The IPO generated gross proceeds of $21.85 million, whilst additional net proceeds of $2.85 million were obtained from over allotment shares and the exercise of 325,000 shares.Based in the Cayman Islands, the organisation specialises in developing natural herb-based medicines for treating neurological conditions such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder, according to its website.Their product candidates are derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations, which they emphasise contain exclusively natural components without synthetic additives.""We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable,"" the company stated in an October filing.In 2022, the organisation expanded into Covid-19 treatments, conducting clinical trials for their experimental comprehensive treatment approach. Regencell reported that their 2022 trial data demonstrated the treatment's effectiveness in alleviating and eliminating Covid symptoms within six days, though these findings await peer review validation.The significant fluctuations in Regencell shares can be attributed to its limited float, the Bloomberg report said. Of the company's approximately 500 million outstanding shares, merely 30 million are tradeable, representing about 6% of total shares.This stands in stark contrast to Apple Inc., with 98% tradeable shares, and Tesla Inc., with 87%. The remaining Regencell shares are held by insiders, with Chief Executive Officer Yat-Gai Au controlling 86%, according to Bloomberg's compiled holding data.","Shares of Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited have jumped by a mind-boggling 46,000% in 2025, despite having no revenue generation since its establishment.

Analysts attributed part of the slowdown to consumers front-loading purchases in April ahead of impending tariffs on automobiles.“Today’s data suggests consumers are downshifting, but they haven’t yet slammed the brakes,” said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, as quoted AP.Adding to the unease, President Donald Trump left the G7 summit early and urged immediate evacuation of Tehran, just hours after calling a nuclear deal with Iran “achievable.” The shift in tone added to market anxiety over the Israel-Iran conflict, which threatens to disrupt global oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz.In response, oil prices surged. Benchmark US crude rose 2.7% to $73.71, while Brent crude gained 2.8% to $75.25 per barrel, extending Friday’s 7% rally before easing slightly on Monday.Despite usually benefiting from high oil prices, solar stocks tumbled on fears that US Congress may roll back clean energy tax credits. Enphase Energy plunged 24.4% and First Solar fell 18%.On the upside, Jabil jumped 11.6% after posting better-than-expected earnings, with CEO Mike Dastoor citing strong AI-related demand.Verve Therapeutics soared 79% after Eli Lilly announced it would acquire the genetic medicine firm in a deal worth up to $1.3 billion, including milestone payments. Shares of Lilly dipped 1.3%.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting with markets widely expecting rates to remain unchanged. The Fed has held off on further cuts after easing once late last year, as it monitors the impact of Trump’s tariffs and watches inflation trends.While inflation has remained near the Fed’s 2% target, the central bank’s updated economic and interest rate projections — due Wednesday — are expected to provide clearer cues for the second half of the year.Bond yields fell slightly after the retail report. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.41% (from 4.46% Monday), while the 2-year yield — more sensitive to Fed expectations — slipped to 3.95% from 3.97%.Globally, European stock indexes fell, while Asia saw mixed trade.

China, the top crude importer, is expected to follow suit with a decline beginning in 2028.Middle East demand will peak in 2027, then begin falling in 2028, with Saudi Arabia forecast to post the ""single largest decline in oil demand for any country"" in absolute terms. The drop comes as the kingdom accelerates efforts to replace oil-fired power generation with gas and renewables.Meanwhile, the IEA noted that recent oil price spikes — triggered by conflict between Israel and Iran — are not backed by market fundamentals.“We have a lot of supply in the market. Demand is much weaker than the supply,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said, adding that the agency does not expect elevated prices to persist. The IEA, he said, is prepared to act if supply disruptions occur.Despite short-term risks, supply growth is expected to outpace demand through 2030. Global oil production capacity is projected to rise by 5.1 million bpd to 114.7 million bpd, nearly twice the growth rate of demand.Saudi Arabia and the United States together will account for 40% of that capacity increase, the agency said.","Global oil demand will decline slightly in 2030 for the first time since the 2020 Covid shock, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.

But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector from 74% to 100%, while ensuring that one of the top officials, chairman, managing director, or CEO, is an Indian citizen. Allowing sector-specific licences, enabling insurers to operate in niche lines such as cyber, property, or marine insurance. The government may notify other classes of business in consultation with IRDA. Permitting mergers between non-insurance and insurance companies. Shifting from detailed statutory prescriptions to a regulation-driven framework, giving IRDA the authority to set operational norms such as capital requirements, solvency margins, and investment conditions through regulations rather than Parliament-approved legislation. The Bill allows IRDA to set commission and remuneration caps for agents. Establishing a Policyholders’ education and protection fund funded through penalties imposed on insurers. Expand the definition of insurance intermediaries to include entities such as insurance repositories. Eased licensing requirements for surveyors and loss assessors, with oversight moving to a regulatory framework. Allowing LIC to establish zonal offices without prior approval from the Centre and enable overseas branches to maintain funds. Provide for a five-year term for the chairperson and other whole-time members of IRDA, or until they reach 65 years, whichever is earlier.

The government on Tuesday introduced the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Bill, 2025 in Parliament, but what could it mean for you?The Bill, already cleared by the Union Cabinet, aims to revolutionise India’s insurance sector, making coverage easier to access for all and setting the ambitious goal of universal protection by 2047. Major changes are lined up for the Insurance Act, 1938, the LIC Act, 1956, and the IRDA Act, 1999.The proposed amendments are designed to modernise the sector, widen capital access, and enhance protection for policyholders. Key features of the Bill include:Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed in this year’s Budget speech to raise foreign investment to 100% as part of new-generation financial sector reforms. So far, the sector has attracted Rs 82,000 crore through FDI.The Bill aims to accelerate growth, improve policyholder protection, bring transparency to regulations, and attract significant investments, creating more opportunities for insurers and intermediaries across India.","The government on Tuesday introduced the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Bill, 2025 in Parliament.

Gold price prediction today

:

are well-supported and are expected to rise in the domestic market as the rupee continues to be weak, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

On December 15, spot gold swung between $4285 and $4351 and was somewhat volatile as traders are turning cautious before the US job report due on Tuesday.

The yellow metal was thwarted around $4353, December 12 high, and the highest level since October 21. At the time of writing, the metal was trading steady around $4304.

Buoyed by a dovish FOMC outcome on December 10 meeting, in which the Fed slashed the Fed Fund rate by 25 bps to 3.5%-3.75% and decided to buy $40 billion worth of US T-bills/month for several months, spot gold closed with a huge weekly gain of 2.5% at $4302.

The shiny metal trimmed some of its gains on Friday due to mixed Fedspeak on monetary policy outlook.

Data roundup:

China's data dump on December 16 turned out to be disappointing as new home prices slid 0.39% in November, the 30th straight monthly decline. Retail sales in November were up by merely 1.3% Vs the forecast of 2.9%, which makes it the slowest increase since December 2022. Industrial production was up by 4.8% Vs the forecast of 5%. Fixed assets rural YTD y-o-y were down 2.6% Vs the estimate of 2.3% as residential property sales fell 11.2% YTD.

US data released on December 15 were uninspiring as December Empire manufacturing Index came in at -3.9 Vs the estimate of 10, while NAHB Index at 39 matched the forecast, which is highest since April, but a reading below 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as poor than good.

ETF and COMEX inventory:

As of December 12, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 98.33 MOz, highest since October 23, as holdings rose for the third straight week. Holdings have risen 18.69% YTD,15.48 MOz - equivalent to 482 tons.

Gold ETFs have attracted a net inflow of around 25 tons in the last two weeks.

Registered COMEX gold inventory stands at 18.95 MOz, highest since February 2, but down 21.88% from the record high of 24.25 MOz noted on April 7 on investors opting for physical ownership of the metal in uncertain times.

Zimbabwe to introduce gold ETF by June:

Zimbabwe, which has accumulated 4.02 tons of gold, plans to start a gold ETF by June.

Fed watch:

US President has zeroed down on Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett as his top choices to succeed Powell as the next Fed Chair

NY Fed President John Williams said that US monetary policy is well-positioned for next year following the December 10 rate cut. He expects growth to pick up on fiscal policy support and AI investments, while inflation may dip slightly below 2.5%.

Fed Governor Miran said that the Fed's policy is unnecessarily restrictive.

The Fed governor Waller will speak on the economic outlook at the Yale CEO summit on December 17, while NY Fed President John Williams will deliver opening remarks at the FX Market Structure Conference on December 17.

Atlanta Fed President Bostic will be a part of a moderated discussion at the Gwinnett County Chamber of Commerce on December 17.

US Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index was nearly 0.05% lower at 98.35.

Two-year US yields dipped nearly 2 bps to 3.50% while ten-year US yields were flat at 4.18% at the time of writing.

US treasuries have returned 6% this year despite fiscal worries and inflation concerns as companies have yet to pass on the entire tariff costs to consumers, tariff revenues have narrowed deficit, US treasury meeting its funding needs through T-bills rather than long-term treasuries and the Fed has cut rates with easing bias remaining intact.

US interest rate expense has grown at the slowest pace since 2021.

Geopolitics watch:

Ukrainian and US negotiators engaged in assessment of talks for the last two days in Berlin over the Ukraine war sounded optimistic that an agreement could be reached by the end of the day as both the sides are said to have reached consensus on nearly 90% of the concerned issues. However, it is to be noted that the major sticky point between Ukraine and Russia over territorial issues continues to linger.

India's gold imports:

India's gold imports stood at $4.02 Billion in November.

Upcoming data:

The US BLS will release nonfarm payroll data for both October and November on December 16. The unemployment rate is expected to rise from 4.4% in September to 4.5% in November.

The US CPI report for November will be released on December 18, the first CPI report in two months.

India’s pension regulator to allow pension funds to invest in gold and silver:

Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is planning to permit NPS funds to invest in gold and silver exchange traded funds, a scheme under which 1% of the corpus under alternative investment category can be permitted for silver and gold ETFs. The National Pension System (NPS), introduced two decades ago, oversees about $177 billion.

Gold Price Outlook:

Spot gold prices are well positioned to extend the rally on the dovish Fed running a monetary policy under fiscal dominance. The Fed Chair Powell showing heightened concerns over the US job market in his post FOMC presser is positive for the metal.

Sluggish Dollar and geopolitical worries add to the charm of the metal.

Gold is expected to trade with a positive bias unless the US nonfarm payroll data is significantly upbeat as Powell has said that there is a possibility that there could be huge downward revisions in the job data since April.

Gold support is at $4245/$4230/$4183. Resistance is at $4354/$ 4382 (all-time high)/$4500. We suggest staying long with strict stop-loss.

Gold is supported in domestic price terms due to the Indian Rupee remaining extremely weak on tariff woes.

How the corpus thresholds work

Accumulated pension wealth up to Rs 8 lakh: Subscribers can withdraw the entire amount as a lump sum. Annuity purchase is optional, up to 20 per cent.

Accumulated pension wealth between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh: Lump sum withdrawal is capped at Rs 6 lakh, with the balance available for annuity purchase or systematic unit withdrawal over a period of up to six years.

Accumulated pension wealth above Rs 12 lakh: At least 20 per cent of the corpus must be used to purchase an annuity, while up to 80 per cent can be withdrawn as a lump sum.

Greater control over retirement savings

In a significant overhaul of retirement withdrawal norms, exiting the National Pension System NPS ) has become more flexible for non-government subscribers.Under amended rules notified by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), eligible NPS members can now withdraw up to 80 per cent of their retirement corpus as a lump sum at the time of exit, reported Economic Times.The revised rules apply to subscribers under the All Citizen Model and Corporate NPS, bringing major relief to non-government sector employees who were earlier required to allocate a larger share of their savings to annuity purchases.As per the amended PFRDA (Exits and Withdrawals under the NPS) Regulations, 2025, notified on December 16, the compulsory annuity purchase requirement for non-government subscribers has been reduced to a minimum of 20 per cent of the accumulated pension wealth in specified cases.Annuities provide regular pension income after retirement, while the remaining portion of the corpus can be withdrawn as a lump sum or through systematic unit withdrawal.Earlier, non-government NPS subscribers had to use at least 40 per cent of their retirement corpus to buy an annuity on exit.The revised annuity requirement applies to normal exits at the age of 60, exits after completing the minimum subscription period, and exits between the ages of 60 and 85.For subscribers whose accumulated pension wealth crosses certain monetary thresholds, at least 20 per cent of the corpus must be set aside for annuity purchase, while up to 80 per cent becomes available for withdrawal.The amended regulations lay down different withdrawal rules based on the size of the retirement corpus:By lowering the mandatory annuity component from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, the PFRDA has given non-government NPS subscribers greater control over how they use their retirement savings. The move increases liquidity at exit and allows retirees more flexibility in planning post-retirement income, while still ensuring a minimum assured pension through annuity purchase.","National Pension System NPS has become more flexible for non-government subscribers.

Rupee falls to fresh low! Currency continues downward streak; reaches 90.83 against US dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-falls-to-fresh-low-currency-continues-downward-streak-reaches-90-83-against-us-dollar/articleshow/125994825.cms,"RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

Rupee extended its downward rally on Tuesday, slipping to a record low of 90.83 against the US dollar. The currency began trading on a weak note, opening 0.1% lower at 90.79 against Monday’s close of 90.73, as continued foreign fund outflows and trade-related uncertainty weighed on the domestic currency.The muted opening follows a sharp sell-off in the previous session, when the rupee slid to an all-time intra-day low of 90.80 before ending trade at a record closing level of 90.78 against the greenback. The domestic unit had registered a loss of 29 paise on Monday, extending its recent losing streak.According to forex traders, persistent risk aversion in the market, strong demand for dollars from importers, kept the currency weak.Concerns also rose over the timing and outcome of an India-US trade deal.VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Investments Limited told TOI that the currency “is likely to stabilise since November trade deficit has come down to $ 24.53 billion from $ 41.64 billion in October. This will take away some pressure on the FIIs to sell anticipating further depreciation.”Earlier on Monday, rupee opened at 90.53 at the interbank foreign exchange market.The latest slide came after the rupee had already fallen 17 paise, last week on Friday to close at 90.49, which was then its lowest-ever level against the US dollar.“The Indian rupee plunged to a record low, positioning it as the worst performer among the Asian currencies. Despite the better-than-expected trade balance number, the rupee was unable to find support,” Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.Looking ahead, Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst, MiraeAsset ShareKhan, said that the currency is likely to remain under pressure in the near term.“The rupee is expected to trade with a negative bias amid delay in Indo-US trade deal and FII outflows,” he said.“A weak dollar and any intervention by the RBI may also support the rupee at lower levels. Investors may watch for central bank monetary policy decisions from BOE, ECB and BoJ. USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of Rs 90.30 to Rs 91.”","Rupee opens 0.1% lower at 90.79 against Monday’s close of 90.73.

Trump expands travel ban and restrictions to include an additional 20 countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-expands-travel-ban-and-restrictions-to-include-an-additional-20-countries/articleshow/126029802.cms,"The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was expanding travel restrictions to an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, doubling the number of nations affected by sweeping limits announced earlier this year on who can travel and emigrate to the USThe Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the US and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.The move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten US entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.People who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the US or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the US interest are all exempt from the restrictions.It was not immediately clear when the new restrictions would take effect.In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.At the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.On Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the US to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian-Authority-issued travel documents, the latest US travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.An additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the US as visitors or to emigrate there.The Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had ""widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records"" that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the USIt also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens who the US wished to deport or had a ""general lack of stability and government control,"" which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.The Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the USThe news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.""This expanded ban is not about national security but instead is another shameful attempt to demonize people simply for where they are from,"" said Laurie Ball Cooper, Vice President of US Legal Programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project.The Trump administration also upgraded restrictions on some countries - Laos and Sierra Leone - that previously were on the partially restricted list and in one case - Turkmenistan - said the country had improved enough to warrant easing some restrictions on travelers from that country. Everything else from the previous travel restrictions announced in June remains in place, the administration said.The new restrictions on Palestinians comes months after the administration imposed limits that make it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport from receiving travel documents to visit the US for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes. The announcement Tuesday goes further, banning people with Palestinian Authority passports from emigrating to the USIn justifying its decision Tuesday, the administration said several ""US -designated terrorist groups operate actively in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens."" The administration also said that the recent war in those areas had ""likely resulted in compromised vetting and screening abilities.""","Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria are added to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the US. 15 other countries are also being added to a list of nations facing partial restrictions.

WTO can't be forum to solve trading problems: US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wto-cant-be-forum-to-solve-trading-problems-us/articleshow/126028659.cms,".

New Delhi: Virtually denouncing the World Trade Organisation WTO ), the US has blamed the Geneva-based body for creating global imbalances and said that it cannot be the forum to solve existing and future problems of the trading system.""The US has serious concerns with the trading system embodied by the WTO, given that the system has overseen and contributed to a world of severe and sustained imbalances. These imbalances, which are driven in part by overcapacity and concentration of production, have created dangerous dependencies and vulnerabilities for many countries and have undermined many countries' legitimate aspirations to develop or maintain industrial capacity,"" it said in a paper on reforming the agency submitted late Monday.Listing out the problems - which seemed primarily focused on China - it argued that trade imbalances were created as countries offered subsidies, suppressed wages, indulged in labour and environmental abuse and used their currency policies, resulting in massive trade deficit in the US, which it is seeking to address. Besides, it said that non-market policies have resulted in over-capacity and over-concentration of production in some countries.It added that WTO has ""no competence on security matters, including economic security"" or addressing supply chain resilience.The US attacked the basic principle of most-favoured nation (MFN) treatment, providing for countries to levy the same level of tariff for a product. ""The MFN principle is not just unsuitable for this era; it prevents countries from optimising their trade relationships in ways that would benefit each party in that relationship. Put differently, MFN impedes welfare-enhancing liberalisation. It pushes members to engage in one venue - WTO - and attempt to develop a one-size-fits-all approach. ""Arguing that the current global system is completely at variance with what was perceived, the paper said: ""It has been replaced by an era of deepening divergence, rooted in some countries' unwillingness to pursue and uphold fair, market-oriented competition, some countries' insistence on maintaining economic systems that that are fundamentally incompatible with WTO principles, and many countries' pursuit of chronic trade surpluses that have adverse economic and political consequences in deficit countries. To face these challenges, trading nations must be able to treat different trading partners differently.""In what was seen as another comment primarily aimed at China, it said that the current architecture has reduced the manufacturing capabilities of not just the US but other developed and developing countries and called for a deep-rooted reform of WTO. Without naming it India it has hit out at countries that are blocking plurilateral agreements - where a group of WTO member nations come together to do sectoral deals - such as those related to investment facilitation.Further, it said that the special and differential treatment, which allows poor and developing countries such as India a longer implementation period and take lower levels of commitments has once again faced American attack, which has called for its elimination.","The US has serious concerns with the trading system embodied by the WTO.

Mumbai: In another twist in the legal battle involving Bharat Forge chairman Baba Kalyani and his sister Sugandha Hiremath, the Bombay high court on Monday allowed Sugandha’s children to amend their lawsuit. The HC order enables them to seek a restraint on voting rights attached to shares of Kalyani Group companies that were acquired using funds from the Kalyani Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).The court also granted permission to Sugandha’s children Sameer Hiremath and his sister Pallavi Swadi to include the request to appoint an administrator to decide on the voting rights of those shares, considering their interests, in their amended suit.At present, Baba Kalyani and his family exercise voting rights over Bharat Forge and Kalyani Steels shares that were acquired or subscribed to through Kalyani HUF funds.The latest order, which overturned a ruling by a Pune court, does not mean Sugandha’s children have obtained voting rights on those shares or have gained administrative oversight of those assets. These matters will be determined by the HC.According to the Hiremaths, Kalyani Group’s assets, including shares and immovable properties originated from and belong to the Kalyani HUF, rather than being solely owned by individual family members. A Kalyani Group spokesperson said: “The order is purely procedural and reflects settled law permitting a party to seek relief. It grants no substantive relief to the Hiremaths in relation to voting rights or property, as is being suggested. ”",Baba Kalyani and his sister Sugandha Hiremath are involved in a legal battle. The Bombay high court has allowed the siblings to amend their lawsuit.

Mumbai: Reserve Bank of India has approved HDFC Bank to acquire and hold an aggregate stake of up to 9.5% in IndusInd Bank, within the regulatory framework governing significant shareholding in banks. The approval, dated Dec 15, 2025, was disclosed by IndusInd Bank in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.HDFC Bank clarified that it does not intend to invest directly in IndusInd Bank. ""As mentioned in the stock exchange intimation, approval from RBI for increasing the investment in IndusInd Bank from 5% to 9.5% was made by HDFC Bank being the banking entity regulated by RBI (on behalf of its group companies); however, HDFC Bank does not intend to make any investment in IndusInd Bank,"" a spokesperson said.The proposed investments will be made by HDFC Bank's group companies, as specifically listed in the exchange filing. ""These investments would be made by the respective companies in their normal course of business and from the open market,"" the spokesperson added.According to sources, the RBI approval is primarily meant to facilitate portfolio investments by HDFC group entities, mainly its mutual fund and insurance arms. Market participants view the holding as financial rather than strategic, with RBI norms and concentration limits making a takeover-style transaction unlikely.The approval allows HDFC Bank, as the sponsor and promoter of its broader financial services group, to hold up to 9.5% of IndusInd Bank's paid-up share capital or voting rights on an aggregate basis.","HDFC Bank does not intend to invest directly in IndusInd Bank.

IndiGo beats Air India duo to be country’s top international carrier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-beats-air-india-duo-to-be-countrys-top-international-carrier/articleshow/126028523.cms,".

New Delhi: In a direct fallout of the June 12 AI 171 crash, IndiGo has for the first time flown more international passengers than Air India group (AI plus AI Express).DGCA data for July-Sept 2025 shows the two Tata Group airlines flew 41 lakh international passengers, while IndiGo was at 41.36 lakh. This was because of the 15% reduction in AI flights — mostly on wide body international routes — after the Ahmedabad Dreamliner crash and a general reluctance from flying AI among travellers for some weeks.Even during India’s worst ever flight disruption seen earlier this month with IndiGo, the budget carrier had cancelled only 2.4% of its 2,702 international flights between Dec 1 and 9. Domestic cancellations were 10 times higher at almost 25% of the 17,404 scheduled flights not being operated during the same time.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) probe into the IndiGo fiasco is specifically examining this disparity in disruptions too. Clearly, the airline wanted to protect its international flights even as domestic ones were in complete disarray.On a standalone basis, IndiGo had overtaken Air India earlier. In 2019, it had become the single largest Indian airline in terms of carrying international passengers when Jet Airways shut down in April of that year.In its last quarter of flying (Jan-March 2019), Jet was the second largest standalone Indian carrier after AI, with IndiGo at the third spot. In Jet’s prime days, the pecking order for Indian carriers in terms of foreign traffic for many years was Jet, AI, AI Express, IndiGo and SpiceJet (Jan-March 2018 as per DGCA data).How things play out in coming few quarters remains to be seen as Air India’s legacy Boeing wide bodies are now being pulled out for revamp and some will be returned to lessors, leading to a fall in its wide body international capacity in the short-to medium-term. On the other hand, the aviation ministry is finalising at least 10% cut in IndiGo flights till such time the dominant low-cost carrier gets its house in order. The cuts in terms of how many international and how many domestic flights are not yet known.For AI, the biggest shock in recent times was crash of Boeing 787 Dreamliner in Ahmedabad killing 260 people. The first wide body crash in India in decades left passengers hesitant travelling the airline for a few weeks, especially on its Boeing 787s.","DGCA data for July-Sept 2025 shows the two Tata Group airlines flew 41 lakh international passengers, while IndiGo was at 41.36 lakh.

Nirav Modi applies to ‘reopen’ his extradition case after confidential legal matter preventing his removal fails,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nirav-modi-applies-to-reopen-his-extradition-case-after-confidential-legal-matter-preventing-his-removal-fails/articleshow/126018765.cms,".

London: Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi applied to reopen his extradition case at the London high court on Tuesday, claiming he had substantial new evidence that he will be interrogated and tortured by the investigating authorities if extradited to India. His confidential legal application, which hitherto had barred his extradition to India, has now “failed”, the court was told.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Nirav (54), said the new evidence had arisen following the Sanjay Bhandari judgment handed down by the same court on Feb 28, which found that Bhandari, accused of tax evasion, should not be extradited as he could be tortured or mistreated by the Indian police or investigative authorities, both within and outside Tihar jail.The Bhandari judgment claimed the use of torture in India to obtain confessions “is commonplace and endemic”.Fitzgerald argued there was a real risk that Nirav would be interrogated by the CBI, ED and other investigative agencies upon his extradition, and that he was at “real risk of torture”, contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR.This “expert evidence” came from former Supreme Court judge Deepak Verma and Ayush Agarwal, a lawyer in India who previously acted for Nirav.A confidential legal matter, which began in April 2018 and barred Nirav’s removal to India despite his extradition being ordered on April 15, 2021, had concluded in Aug and Nirav’s application “had failed”, the court was told. This matter has never been disclosed, but is widely believed to be an asylum claim.Within days Fitzgerald applied to reopen Nirav’s appeal against extradition. Had he not done so, Nirav would have already been removed to India.UK courts may only reopen decisions in exceptional circumstances such as a “supervening event”.Fitzgerald argued that in Nirav’s earlier appeals, the focus was on Nirav’s suicide risk and prison conditions and the issue of torture did not arise, but the Bhandari judgment and several new reports, including one by the US state department, were “the supervening event”.Nirav appeared via video link from a London prison in a khaki T-shirt. He has been in prison since he was arrested on an extradition warrant in March 2019 charged with defrauding Punjab National Bank of over $1 billion.Four men from the CBI and ED flew here from India for the hearing.Helen Malcolm KC, representing India, said: “On 28th Feb the high court gave judgment which had a convulsive effect on all extraditions to India, especially to Tihar jail. Fitzgerald raised this in March and then it went quiet, and then Nirav’s secret application failed, and then suddenly we got this application. I don’t know what the confidential thing was. But I know there is only one statutory thing to stop extradition. My concern is we are now already six years down the line. I just see this going on for the rest of my career.”Malcolm provided new assurances from New Delhi saying Nirav would not be interrogated by any agency on his return to India. But Fitzgerald argued these needed further examination by his experts. The two HC judges agreed. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith told Malcom: “Your chunky assurances came very late.” He added: “We are concerned that the materials we have been given don’t leave us on a stable footing for deciding this application. ”The next hearing is expected to take place in March.","Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi applied to reopen his extradition case at the London high court on Tuesday.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) sales declined by over 4 per cent in early December, driven by IndiGo 's widespread flight cancellations, according to preliminary industry data released on Tuesday.The aviation sector in India had shown steady growth in jet fuel demand for two years following recovery from Covid-related disruptions. However, this pattern shifted when IndiGo experienced extensive cancellations due to new pilot duty-time regulations, staff shortages and winter weather conditions.The airline cancelled approximately 5,000 flights, including more than 1,600 from their usual 2,300 daily flights during peak disruption.Services returned to normal over the weekend.Data showed ATF sales fell to 331,400 tonnes during December 1 to 15, compared to 345,400 tonnes in the corresponding period last year. The sales decreased by 7.2 per cent month-on-month, as reported by PTI.While jet fuel declined, other major fuels demonstrated strong growth. Diesel consumption, representing about 40 per cent of India's fuel usage, increased by nearly 5 per cent to 3.3 million tonnes during December 1-15, although month-on-month sales decreased by 5.5 per cent post-festive season.Compared to 3.16 million tonnes consumption during December 1-15, 2023, diesel demand rose by 4.4 per cent. The increase was 15.2 per cent against 2.87 million tonnes sales in early December 2022.Petrol usage in early December increased by 7.7 per cent to 1.33 million tonnes. Sales were up 8.4 per cent compared to December 1-15, 2023, and showed a 24.7 per cent increase from 1.06 million tonnes in early December 2022. Monthly consumption declined by 5.1 per cent.LPG sales increased by 15.1 per cent to 1.55 million tonnes during December 1-15, driven by domestic cooking requirements. The demand rose by 4.4 per cent month-on-month compared to 1.49 million tonnes sold in early November.The PMUY scheme expanded to include 2.5 million additional households, increasing total coverage from 103.3 million to 105.8 million households.","Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) sales declined by over 4 per cent in early December, driven by IndiGo's widespread flight cancellations.

Easing car emission rules 'pragmatic' response to industry challenges: EU VP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/easing-car-emission-rules-pragmatic-response-to-industry-challenges-eu-vp/articleshow/126012982.cms,"STRASBOURG: Relaxing car emission targets is a ""pragmatic"" answer to the sector's challenges but the EU's green ambitions remain intact, the bloc's industry chief said Tuesday as Brussels walked back a 2035 combustion-engine ban.""The European Commission has chosen an approach that is both pragmatic and consistent with its climate objectives and ambitions,"" Stephane Sejourne told AFP in an interview at the EU parliament.Heeding calls from industry, the European Commission agreed to give ground on one of its flagship climate measures by relaxing the planned ban on new combustion-engine car sales.Instead of a full switch to electric vehicles , Brussels will let carmakers use ""other types of technologies"" for a limited part of their sales beyond 2035, Sejourne said.Adopted under commission chief Ursula von der Leyen's first term, the combustion-engine ban was a key part of the EU's pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.""The goal remains the same,"" said the commission vice president. ""But the flexibilities are pragmatic given consumer uptake and the difficulty for manufacturers to offer 100 percent electric by 2035.""Faced with competition from China and trade tensions with the United States, the EU has delayed or pared back a series of green measures in a pro-business shift over the past year.Sejourne back in March warned that Europe's car industry was in ""mortal danger"" as the EU launched a rescue plan for the sector, with rivals speeding ahead in the United States and China.The jewel in Europe's industrial crown, the auto industry employs almost 14 million people and contributes some seven percent to the European Union's economy -- but faces rising threats.Sejourne rejected the charge from environmentalists that the concessions granted to automakers undermine Europe's climate goals.""The electric transition remains the objective, but these flexibilities are pragmatic in the current context,"" he told AFP in Tuesday's interview.Germany and Poland had pushed hard for a rollback of the 2035 ban and the right to keep selling combustion engine cars beyond 2035.France was more cautious, fearing the move could stifle Europe's emerging electric battery sector.Sejourne stressed that France had not lost out, noting the 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in interest-free loans to European battery makers announced as part of the commission's new measures.","European Commission agrees to give ground on one of its flagship climate measures.

The US Wall Street showed minimal movement on Tuesday, with mixed economic indicators providing little clarity about future interest rate directions.Early trading saw the S&P 500 decrease by 0.1%, remaining slightly below its recent record high. At 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4 points, whilst the Nasdaq composite declined by 0.2%.Treasury yields remained relatively stable following initial fluctuations. Reports indicated the highest US unemployment rate since 2021, despite higher-than-expected job additions. Additionally, October's retail revenue growth exceeded economists' forecasts.These varied reports initially lowered Treasury yields. Investors initially interpreted the data as potentially influencing the Federal Reserve to prioritise addressing unemployment over inflation, possibly leading to further interest rate reductions in 2026.However, yields subsequently fluctuated.Interest rate decisions significantly influence Wall Street, as lower rates can stimulate economic growth and investment values, despite potential inflationary risks.

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

US saw a significant cutdown in jobs in November, marking a record unemployment high since 2021. It gained 64,000 jobs in November, over October's loss of 105,000 positions, primarily due to federal workforce reductions under the Trump administration. The unemployment level increased to 4.6%, reaching its peak since 2021.The Labour Department's delayed reports, released on Tuesday, were postponed by the 43-day federal government closure. November's employment growth exceeded economists' predictions of 40,000, while October's decline stemmed from 162,000 federal workers departing by fiscal year 2025's end on September 30, influenced by Elon Musk 's reduction of government personnel.Official revisions reduced August and September employment figures by 33,000 positions. Employment growth has slowed, affected by uncertainty regarding President Trump's tariff policies and the lingering impact of Federal Reserve's elevated interest rates from 2022-2023 to control inflation.While organisations maintain current staff, they hesitate to expand, grappling with artificial intelligence integration and adaptation to Trump's unpredictable policies, particularly his substantial import tariffs.This situation complicates job searches, while Federal Reserve officials debate interest rate adjustments amidst delayed economic data following the shutdown.The unemployment rate, though historically moderate, has risen since its 54-year low of 3.4% in April 2023. The situation is further complicated by advancing technology potentially reducing workforce requirements.""We've seen a lot of the businesses that we support are stuck in that stagnant mode: 'Are we going to hire or are we not? What can we automate? What do we need the human touch with?''' said Matt Hobbie, vice president of the staffing firm HealthSkil in Allentown, Pennsylvania, as quoted by Associated Press.""We're in Lehigh Valley, which is a big transportation hub in eastern Pennsylvania. We've seen some cooling in the logistics and transportation markets, specifically because we've seen automation in those sectors, robotics,"" he added.Employment concerns prompted the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points, marking the third reduction this year. Three Fed officials opposed this decision, marking the highest dissent in six years. Some officials resist further cuts while inflation exceeds the 2% target. Two maintained their position for unchanged rates, while Trump appointee Stephen Miran supported a larger reduction.The shutdown delayed the Labour Department's September, October and November reports. The September report emerged on November 20, with partial October data released alongside November's report on Tuesday. October's unemployment rate remained uncalculated due to the shutdown.","US saw a significant cutdown in jobs in November, marking a record unemployment high since 2021.

China's Economic Crisis: Record Exports but Plummeting Domestic Growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-1-trillion-trade-surplus-xi-jinping-chinas-economic-model-chinas-property-crisis/articleshow/126007300.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

'No Free Lift For India': PM Modi's Chief Economic Adviser Says China Won’t Repeat West’s Mistake

Why it matters

The big picture: A lopsided economy

Indeed, China’s surplus is more a problem for itself than for the rest of the world. It is the only big country where inflation looks dangerously low. Hiring is weak, consumers lack confidence, and the property market has entered the fifth year of a seemingly intractable slump. The central bank is worried that lower interest rates will hurt banks’ margins. And the government is reluctant to do whatever it takes to turn things round. An article in the Economist

Zoom in: The property crisis is the epicenter

Between the lines:

Xi Jinping

is worried about fake growth

“All plans must be based on facts,” Xi said. “Those who act recklessly without regard for reality must be held strictly accountable.”

Growing trade headwinds

The outlook: More of the same - for now

China has become dependent on the spending of foreigners to stabilise its own economy. It is not being anti-social. But it is being unwise. The Economist

The bottom line

China’s economic engine sputtered hard in November, with retail sales rising just 1.3% - the weakest since December 2022, when “zero-Covid” ended - and industrial production slowing to 4.8%, a 15-month low.Meanwhile, fixed-asset investment dropped 2.6%, the worst performance in decades, and property investment plunged nearly 16%. Even the usually robust auto and appliance markets collapsed, with car sales down 8.5% and home appliance sales falling a staggering 19%, per Bloomberg.“The economy faced a number of challenges,” China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. “There were many external instabilities and uncertainties, and domestic demand was insufficient.”Beijing has been over-reliant on exports to meet its annual growth target of around 5%. That worked in 2025, helping China notch a record $1 trillion trade surplus, but the strategy is showing serious cracks:* Domestic demand is faltering under the weight of a real estate crisis, weak consumer confidence, and fading fiscal stimulus.* Global frustration is rising over China’s massive export surplus.* Protectionist responses are escalating - from the US and Europe to Mexico.“Strong exports limited the need to turbocharge domestic demand this year,” said Xu Tianchen of the Economist Intelligence Unit. “Policymakers have turned their attention to 2026, since the 5% growth target seems within reach.”But the warning signs are piling up that next year could be far tougher.The imbalance between booming exports and collapsing consumption is becoming untenable:* Retail sales growth has now slowed for six consecutive months, the longest streak since 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal.* Despite $1 trillion in exports, China’s domestic economy is stuck in low-gear recovery, with consumer sentiment still shaken by years of lockdowns and a deteriorating property market.* Singles’ Day, China’s Black Friday, ran for five weeks this year. Even that failed to excite cautious spenders.“November data point to broad-based weakness in domestic activity,” said Zichun Huang of Capital Economics. “Policy support should help drive a partial recovery… but this probably won’t prevent China’s growth from remaining weak across 2026.”Bloomberg noted that November’s 1.3% retail sales growth missed every estimate in its analyst survey.At the center of China’s consumption problem sits its property market, which for decades doubled as both a growth engine and a savings account. Roughly 70% of household wealth is tied up in real estate, according to estimates cited by the International Monetary Fund.That wealth is still shrinking.New home prices fell further in November, and property investment dropped 15.9% in the first eleven months of the year, widening from earlier declines. Fixed-asset investment overall fell 2.6% over the same period, one of the sharpest pullbacks on record, according to official data cited by Reuters, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal.The trouble is no longer confined to weaker developers. China Vanke, long seen as relatively stable and backed by state-linked lenders, plans to hold another bondholder meeting this week after investors rejected a proposal to delay repayment on an onshore bond. The company is now racing against the clock during the bond’s grace period, according to Reuters.“Developers are struggling to convince investors there are buyers for their apartments,” said Fu Linghui, NBS spokesperson. “Even discounted units remain unsold.”The IMF has warned that repairing the sector could cost the equivalent of 5% of GDP over the next three years. But even that figure understates the psychological damage. Unsold apartments, discounted units, and half-finished developments have turned housing from a source of security into a reminder of risk.At last week’s Central Economic Work Conference, President Xi Jinping issued a rare rebuke of GDP-chasing and inflated local data, warning that “reckless” projects and overbuilt industrial zones are wasting resources and distorting progress, a Bloomberg report said.His call for “high-quality, sustainable development” was widely seen as a rebuke of the decades-long model that emphasized GDP at any cost - often backed by wasteful borrowing and inflated statistics.Yet the contradiction is stark:* Xi demands quality growth,* But local officials remain judged on quantity,* While global demand for Chinese goods is starting to fade under rising tariffs.While exports saved China’s 2025 performance, protectionism is spreading fast - and the backlash is now global, not just from Washington.* French President Emmanuel Macron warned of tariffs and called China’s trade practices “unsustainable.”* Mexico approved new tariffs of up to 50% on Chinese imports starting next year to protect local manufacturers.* US and European leaders continue to pressure China over industrial overcapacity and export dumping, particularly in clean energy and EVs.“China is too large to rely on exports for growth,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned last week.Despite warnings, no aggressive new stimulus appears imminent.* The People’s Bank of China is expected to cut interest rates moderately in early 2026.* The government may repeat a 4% budget deficit, per economists cited by Bloomberg.* Leaders pledged a “proactive fiscal policy,” but specifics are scarce.China’s 30-year bond futures have slumped to their lowest levels since 2024, and stock markets remain under pressure. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index is down 1.3% amid renewed real estate fears.Still, the 5% growth target for 2026 - seen as politically important - remains in place, likely buoyed by modest stimulus and base effects.For now, China is still likely to hit its growth target of around 5% this year. Most economists expect Beijing to set a similar target for 2026, along with a fiscal stimulus package roughly the same size as this year’s.But confidence in the medium-term outlook is fading.“November data point to a broad-based weakness in domestic activity, largely due to a pull-back in fiscal spending,” said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. “Policy support should help drive a partial recovery in the coming months, but this probably won’t avert China’s growth from remaining weak across 2026 as a whole.”Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, was more blunt in comments cited by Bloomberg. “While a 5% real growth target is likely a done deal, 2026 will be a much more challenging year if the stress persists,” he said.China’s economy is not collapsing. It is stalling in a more subtle, more politically uncomfortable way. The factories still run. The ships still leave port. But inside the country, households remain cautious, investors hesitant, and policymakers caught between old instincts and new constraints.(With inputs from the agencies)","China's economic engine sputtered hard in November, with retail sales rising just 1.3% - the weakest since December 2022.

World's richest just got richer! Elon Musk becomes first person to cross $600 bn net worth — how SpaceX's $800 bn valuation helped,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/worlds-richest-just-got-richer-elon-musk-becomes-first-person-to-cross-600-bn-net-worth-how-spacexs-800-bn-valuation-helped/articleshow/126005918.cms,"Elon Musk became first person ever to have a fortune exceeding $600 billion, with the sharp rise in the value of his companies, particularly SpaceX, driving his net worth to unprecedented levels.The latest jump follows a offer launched by SpaceX earlier this month that values the private rocket company at $800 billion, up from $400 billion in August. The transaction has pushed Musk’s estimated net worth to $677 billion as of midday Monday, according to Forbes. At this level, Musk is now closer to becoming a trillionaire than he is to the world’s second-richest individual.Musk holds an estimated 42% stake in SpaceX, and the revised valuation has added about $168 billion to his personal wealth.No other individual has previously crossed the $600 billion mark, or even reached $500 billion, underscoring the scale of the milestone.Investors say SpaceX is also laying the groundwork for a public listing in 2026, with a potential valuation of around $1.5 trillion. One investor confirmed the IPO target to Forbes, while noting that details of the tender offer and listing plans had already been reported by several outlets.Musk and SpaceX did not respond to Forbes’ requests for comment.The surge has reshaped the composition of Musk’s fortune. His stake in SpaceX is now estimated at $336 billion, making it his most valuable asset. By contrast, his roughly 12% holding in Tesla is valued at $197 billion, excluding stock options tied to his 2018 CEO Performance Award.Those options were invalidated by a Delaware judge in January 2024. While Musk has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court, Forbes has discounted the value of the options by 50%, placing them at $69 billion pending the outcome of the case.Tesla, however, could still play a decisive role in Musk’s march towards trillionaire status. In November, shareholders approved a record pay package that could award Musk up to $1 trillion in additional Tesla stock, before taxes and the costs of unlocking restricted shares, provided the company meets so-called “Mars shot” performance targets. These include increasing Tesla’s market capitalisation more than eight times over the next decade.Musk’s wealth also extends into artificial intelligence and social media. xAI Holdings, formed in March through the merger of Musk’s AI startup xAI and social media platform X, formerly Twitter, is reportedly seeking fresh funding at a valuation of $230 billion. That figure is more than double the $113 billion valuation Musk cited at the time of the merger. Forbes estimates Musk owns 53% of xAI Holdings, worth around $60 billion.The scale of Musk’s current wealth marks a dramatic rise from just a few years ago. In March 2020, his fortune was estimated at $24.6 billion. A surge in Tesla shares made him the fifth person ever worth $100 billion by August that year. He topped the global rich list for the first time in January 2021 with a net worth approaching $190 billion.Further milestones followed quickly: $200 billion in September 2021, making him only the third person to reach that level after Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault; $300 billion in November 2021; $400 billion in December 2024; and $500 billion in October. Only Oracle founder Larry Ellison has also reached the $300 billion and $400 billion thresholds.","Elon Musk became first person ever to have a fortune exceeding $600 billion.

Russia hit with fresh sanctions! European Union adds firms tied to Moscow’s shadow fleet to list; bans oil traders with connections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/russia-hit-with-fresh-sanctions-european-union-adds-firms-tied-to-moscows-shadow-fleet-to-list-bans-oil-traders-with-connections/articleshow/126002663.cms,"EU Vs Russia Showdown Over €190+ BN Assets; MEP Warns Of 'Putin's Wrath'; 'Self Destruction'

Traders under scrutiny

The European Union has expanded its sanctions list on entities connected to Russia’s oil trade, with a new round of measures aimed at traders and shipping networks accused of enabling Moscow to continue crude exports despite Western restrictions.The new sanctions name oil traders Murtaza Lakhani and Etibar Eyyub, who, according to EU, were involved in facilitating Russian oil shipments that continue to generate revenue for the Kremlin amid the war in Ukraine. Since the invasion, Brussels has rolled out 19 sanctions packages, yet Russia has adjusted its trade routes and continues to sell large volumes of oil to buyers such as India and China, often at reduced prices, Reuters cited.European officials say much of this oil is transported through a “shadow fleet” of tankers that operate beyond the reach of Western insurers and shipping regulators. The latest measures aim to disrupt these networks by banning EU citizens and companies from doing business with the individuals and firms listed, limiting their access to shipping services, insurance and finance.With the latest additions, more than 2,600 individuals and entities are now subject to EU sanctions. According to the Council of the European Union and notices published in the EU’s Official Journal, nine individuals and organisations linked to the shadow tanker fleet have been targeted, including figures associated with Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as companies involved in owning or managing oil tankers.Market analysts expect the EU to expand the list further in the coming days, potentially adding more than 40 vessels linked to Russia’s shadow fleet. If confirmed, this would push the number of sanctioned ships to around 600.Moscow dismissed the new sanctions as ineffective. Russia’s Permanent Mission to the EU said the measures would ultimately harm EU citizens rather than Russia, and would fail to achieve their intended aims.“We note with regret Brussels' inability to recognise a simple truth: if the same action is repeated over and over and does not produce the desired result, it means the original strategy fundamentally does not work and is flawed,” the mission said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies.It added that the sanctions would deepen “the growing socio-economic problems and the declining standard of living for European citizens”.One of the central figures named in the sanctions is Murtaza Lakhani, a Canadian-Pakistani oil trader and chief executive of Mercantile & Maritime Group. The EU said that companies under his control had enabled the shipment and export of Russian oil, including crude from the state-owned giant Rosneft.“Through his companies, he enables shipments and export of Russian oil, notably from the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft,” the EU’s Official Journal said.“In particular, Murtaza Lakhani controls vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products originating in Russia or being exported from Russia.”Requests for comment sent to Lakhani, Mercantile & Maritime, Litasco Middle East DMCC and 2Rivers Group were not answered.Lakhani, 63, runs Mercantile & Maritime Group, a mid-sized oil trading firm with offices in London and Singapore. His career began at global commodities trader Glencore, where he worked on Iraqi oil exports during the Saddam Hussein period. He later operated in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, helping facilitate oil sales independent of Baghdad by acting as an intermediary between the regional oil ministry and international energy firms.That work brought him into close contact with Rosneft, which he helped secure oil and gas agreements in Kurdistan. He worked alongside Rosneft chief executive Igor Sechin, including during deal signings at Russia’s flagship economic forum in St Petersburg, Reuters reported.The relationship later extended into investment. Lakhani partnered with oil trader Vitol to acquire a 5% stake in Vostok Oil, Rosneft’s largest oil project in decades, located in the Arctic.“This country (Russia) is the largest resource country in the world. Hampering it is a very short-term effect, not a long-term goal for anybody. They will always need Russia,” he said during an appearance on Russia’s SolovievLive at the St Petersburg Forum in June.The EU has also sanctioned Valery Kildiyarov, who serves as a director at Lukoil’s trading subsidiary Litasco Middle East DMCC, which is already under sanctions, and as a manager at another Lukoil-linked trading firm, Alghaf Marine, based in Dubai.Etibar Eyyub was listed alongside Anar Madatli and Talat Safarov due to their links with Coral Energy, a trading house that was later renamed 2Rivers Group, the Council of the European Union said.Coral Energy had risen to become one of the leading traders of Russian oil. Following a management buyout and rebranding in 2024, 2Rivers said it had largely stopped trading Russian oil in 2023 and exited its final contract in early 2024.After sanctions were imposed by the UK and the EU, the company said it ceased all trading activities in June and formally wound up the business in August.","The EU has expanded its sanctions list on entities connected to Russia’s oil trade.

'Access this huge market on their own terms '



Investors may soon be able to trade Wall Street benchmark Nasdaq for almost all day!Nasdaq, the tech heavy benchmark, is preparing to seek regulatory approval to introduce near-continuous stock trading, as international interest in US equities continues to rise, pushing exchanges to rethink traditional market hours, Reuters reported.The exchange operator, which lists technology giants including Nvidia, Apple and Amazon, submitted documents to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday outlining plans for 23-hour-a-day trading, five days a week. The proposal would move Nasdaq closer to round-the-clock access for global investors.Demand for uninterrupted trading in US stocks has grown steadily in recent years, prompting regulators to update market rules and approve extended-hours proposals from major exchanges. The US equity market now accounts for almost two-thirds of global listed market value, while overseas investors held $17 trillion worth of US equities last year, according to Nasdaq data, cited by Reuters.The filing represents Nasdaq’s first formal regulatory step towards nonstop trading. In March, Nasdaq President Tal Cohen said discussions with regulators were underway and that a five-day-a-week continuous trading model could be launched in the second half of 2026.The New York Stock Exchange and Cboe Global Markets have also announced similar plans.“There’s been this trend towards globalization for some time and we’ve seen the US markets themselves become much more global,” Chuck Mack, senior vice president of North American markets at Nasdaq, told Reuters.Trading hours for stocks and exchange-traded products would increase from 16 hours to 23 hours each day.At present, Nasdaq operates a pre-market session from 4 am to 9:30 am Eastern Time, a regular trading session from 9:30 am to 4 pm, and a post-market session that runs until 8 pm.Under the proposed structure, Nasdaq would reduce its current three-session weekday schedule to two extended sessions. The day session would run continuously from 4 am to 8 pm, followed by a one-hour operational break. A night session would then begin at 9 pm and continue until 4 am the next calendar day.Trades executed between 9 pm and midnight would be recorded as trades for the following day. The trading week would start at 9 pm on Sunday and conclude at 8 pm on Friday after the end of the day session.The exchange said the opening and closing bells would remain unchanged, ringing at 9:30 am and 4 pm respectively during the day session, which would still include pre-market, regular and post-market trading periods.The shift to continuous trading will depend on infrastructure upgrades, particularly to the securities information processor that provides consolidated stock prices across US exchanges. The US Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation is also scheduled to introduce nonstop stock clearing by the end of 2026, Reuters reported.Supporters of extended trading hours say the change would help investors outside the US respond more quickly to global events that occur when US markets are closed. Wall Street banks, however, have raised concerns about thinner liquidity, higher volatility and the commercial viability of nonstop trading.Mack said demand for overnight trading has risen despite historically lower volumes during extended hours, noting that many investors already rely on off-exchange platforms and alternative trading systems such as Blue Ocean, Bruce ATS and OTC Moon.“We see these things manifest themselves in the US equities market, through increasing demand for companies specifically listed on Nasdaq from geographies outside of the US, much more now than in the past,” he said.“If you think of those investors around the world, they want to access this huge market on their own terms and they want to do it in their own time zones,” Reuters cited the expert.US exchange trading hours date back more than 100 years, when transactions were carried out in person on trading floors. While trading is now predominantly electronic, market schedules have changed little over time.Earlier this year, Nasdaq also filed with regulators to allow trading in tokenised stocks, as interest in tokenisation has increased amid a relaxation of crypto-related regulations under the Trump administration.","Nasdaq submits plans for 23-hour-a-day trading, five days a week.

Ford EV reset: US carmaker scales back electric ambitions after Trump’s policy rollback; forecasts $19.5 bn write-down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ford-ev-reset-us-carmaker-scales-back-electric-ambitions-after-trumps-policy-rollback-forecasts-19-5-bn-write-down/articleshow/125993467.cms,"Ford has redrawn its electric vehicle roadmap, announcing that it will pull back from large EVs as the US carmaker transitions towards hybrids, petrol-powered trucks and a new battery storage venture. The auto giant also predicted profits to take a hit of almost $19.5 billion in the next few years.The US automaker, on Monday, said that several large electric models will be dropped, including the F-150 Lightning, as demand has failed to meet expectations amid rising costs and changes in regulation. The decision marks a clear departure from Ford’s earlier EV-heavy ambitions, at a time when the industry is reassessing the pace of the electric transition.“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” chief executive Jim Farley said, adding that “the operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities.”The announcement follows a move by US President Donald Trump to roll back stricter fuel economy rules introduced under former president Joe Biden, which had encouraged US carmakers to accelerate investments in electric vehicles.Farley welcomed the rollback, saying Trump was “aligning fuel economy standards with market realities” and calling it “a win for customers and common sense.”Trump has frequently criticised what he called an EV “mandate”, while Republican lawmakers have also scrapped clean-energy tax credits that had supported EV sales.Going forward, Ford said its electric vehicle development will be limited to smaller, lower-priced models. Production of the current F-150 Lightning has already been stopped, the company said. Its successor will be launched as a hybrid model, pairing an electric battery with a petrol engine and offering a driving range of more than 700 miles.Plans to introduce new electric commercial vans in Europe and North America have also been abandoned. Instead, Ford will produce petrol and hybrid vans at its Ohio assembly plant from 2029. In Tennessee, the company will retool its EV-focused factory, now to be renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant, to build affordable petrol-powered trucks from the same year.As part of its broader reset, Ford is also entering the battery energy storage market. A plant in Kentucky will be converted to manufacture storage systems for data centres and power utilities. The company expects to invest around $2 billion over two years in the project and aims to reach an annual capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours by late 2027, positioning itself as a significant player in the fast-growing sector.",The US automaker said that several large electric models will be dropped.

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

US President Donald Trump’s $100,000 price tag for new H-1B workers hired from outside the US will have punishing effects for the IT outsourcing and staffing industries that have long been a target of both parties.The fee is the biggest restriction the Trump administration has imposed so far on employment of skilled foreign workers.A Bloomberg analysis found it will have a disproportionate impact on multinational staffing firms that act as middlemen for companies seeking H-1B workers. Those middlemen include TCS Infosys , and Cognizant.Almost 90% of new H-1B hires at those three companies between May 2020 and May 2024 were approved at US consulates.The workers would have cost each of them hundreds of millions more if the fee had been in effect.More than 93% of new Infosys H-1B hires in that timeframe — upwards of 10,400 workers — would have been hit with the $100,000 fee, the Bloomberg analysis showed, adding up to more than a billion dollars in visa charges.TCS would have had to pay the fee for 6,500 workers over that period, or 82% of newly approved H-1B workers. Cognizant would be faced with the charge for more than 5,600 employees, or 89% of new H-1B hires.Even if legal challenges are successful in quickly blocking the fee, industry observers expect it will to lead to a steep drop in visa demand and drive placement of more workers overseas.Large tech and IT firms have traditionally dominated the H-1B programme, the primary pathway to US careers for foreign workers with at least a bachelor’s degree. They claim most of the 85,000 visa slots available each year.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have claimed that companies use the programme as a cheap alternative to American workers, although H-1B employees must be paid a “prevailing wage” for their industry and early-career H-1B workers typically garner well above the US median wage.Workers from outside the US, rather than recent international graduates of US colleges already in the country, accounted for more than four out of 10 new H-1B hires approved over the past four years, data analysed by Bloomberg showed.",The fee is the biggest restriction the Trump administration has imposed so far on employment of skilled foreign workers.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

The proposed amendments

Raising foreign direct investment in the insurance sector from 74 per cent to 100 per cent, while mandating that at least one of the top executives, the chairman, managing director, or chief executive officer, must be an Indian citizen.

Introducing sector-specific licences, allowing insurers to operate in specialised segments such as cyber, property, or marine insurance, with the government empowered to notify additional classes of business in consultation with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA).

Allowing mergers between insurance and non-insurance companies.

Moving away from detailed statutory provisions to a regulation-led framework, granting IRDA the authority to prescribe operational norms—including capital requirements, solvency margins, and investment conditions—through regulations rather than Parliamentary legislation.

Empowering IRDA to set limits on commissions and remuneration for insurance agents.

Creating a Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund, to be financed through penalties levied on insurers.

Expanding the definition of insurance intermediaries to include entities such as insurance repositories.

Easing licensing norms for surveyors and loss assessors, with regulatory oversight replacing statutory control.

Allowing the Life Insurance Corporation of India to set up zonal offices without prior Central government approval and permitting its overseas branches to maintain funds abroad.

Providing for a five-year tenure for the IRDA chairperson and other whole-time members, or until they attain the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier.

NEW DELHI: The Parliament on Wednesday cleared the new insurance bill that allows 100% FDI. The ""Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha Bill"" was passed in Rajya Sabha, a day after getting Lok Sabha's nod.This comes despite several Rajya Sabha opposition members' demands that it's referred to a Parliamentary committee fir further scrutiny. The members also objected to the Bill’s title, noting that it uses both English and Hindi.The debate on the bill began after being moved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for consideration. The bill, cleared by Union Cabinet earlier aims to transform India’s insurance sector, making coverage access easier and facilitating universal protection by 2047. This will include major changes, lined up for the Insurance Act, 1938, the LIC Act, 1956, and the IRDA Act, 1999.Also read: Lok Sabha clears 'SHANTI' bill as opposition walks out; paves way for entry of private players Sitharaman had first talked about this bill in her budget speech in February.

Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , ended higher on Friday, tracking positive global cues. While Nifty50 settled close to the 26,000 mark, the BSE Sensex jumped nearly 450 points. At the close, Nifty50 settled at 25,966.40, up 150.85 points or 0.58%, while the BSE Sensex ended at 84,929.36, gaining 447.55 points or 0.53%.After experiencing weakness, the Nifty index appeared to stabilize with a slight downward trend on Thursday. Analysts suggest that the market's short-term trend remains volatile with a weak bias.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “FIIs stopping selling during the last two days, though positive from the market perspective, doesn’t indicate a directional change in the market. A lot will depend on the Bank of Japan’s rate decision today. It is almost certain that BoJ will raise rates by 25bp and, therefore, such a decision is unlikely to impact the market. What the market is looking for is commentary from the Japanese central bank regarding future rate action in the context of inflation in Japan. If the BoJ chief sends a hawkish message indicating more rate hikes, that would impact the market since the market will fear further unwinding of the yen carry trade, triggering more FII outflows from markets like India.Therefore, watch out for the BoJ commentary.”“Meanwhile, cooling inflation in the US ( November core inflation has come at 2.6%, lower than the estimate of 3%) is imparting resilience to the US economy and markets. This augurs well for global equity markets as 2025 draws to a close.”Asian stocks rose on Friday following a report of cooling US inflation, which bolstered the case for potential interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. This, along with easing concerns in the tech sector, supported gains in US stocks.On Wall Street, the main indexes ended higher on Thursday. A soft inflation report fueled expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, while a strong forecast from chipmaker Micron indicated robust demand for AI technology.The Consumer Price Index showed that consumer prices rose less than anticipated over the year to November. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics did not release month-to-month CPI changes due to the 43-day government shutdown, which disrupted the collection of October data.On Thursday, foreign portfolio investors purchased shares worth Rs 596 crore. Domestic institutional investors were also net buyers, acquiring shares worth Rs 2,700 crore.","Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex ended higher on Friday, tracking positive global cues.

Rupee continues to rebound! Currency makes its way back from the 90 level; reaches 89 against US dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-trading-against-us-dollar-on-december-19-2025/articleshow/126068984.cms,"RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

Rupee continued its upward rally against the US dollar on Friday, strengthening past its 90 mark to reach 89.96 against US dollar in early trade. The currency opened at 90.1325 per dollar, up about 0.1% from its previous close of 90.20 against US dollar. This comes after Rupee made a tentative recovery after sliding to record lows earlier this week, even depreciating to the 91 level against US dollar.This rebound was largely attributed to intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which stepped in to sell dollars after the currency came under intense and sustained pressure. Bankers said the apex bank's intervention was aimed at disrupting the one-way depreciation that had built up in the market, triggering unwinding of bearish positions.Market participants noted that the RBI’s latest move was similar to its approach in October and November. Back then, it had intervened multiple times to counter persistent weakness in the currency, selling dollars heavily in both the spot and non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets.Meanwhile, State Bank of India (SBI) has also projected a strong rebound in rupee in the latter half of the next financial year, expecting the recovery to take shape between October 2026 and March 2027, according to its latest report.The country’s largest lender said that its outlook is based on historical currency trends and internal analysis, which suggest that the current phase of weakness is not structural. The report noted that rupee has undergone multiple cycles of depreciation and appreciation in the past and is likely to move out of the present downtrend in the second half of the next fiscal year.","Rupee continued its upward rally against the US dollar on Friday, strengthening past its 90 mark.

Adani Grp eyes 12 airports in 1L cr infra plan

MUMBAI: Adani Group , India’s fifth-largest conglomerate by market value, intends to bid for nearly a dozen airports slated for privatisation as part of its Rs 1-lakh-crore investment plan for aviation infrastructure over the next five years. Earlier this year, govt announced plans to lease out 11 airports, including those in Amritsar and Varanasi.“Out of the Rs 1-lakh-crore, some part is earmarked and provisioned for the next round of airport bidding,” Jeet Adani, director at Adani Group, who oversees the country’s largest private airport network, told TOI. The investment, which will be funded through a mix of debt and equity, will also be deployed to build new terminals and upgrade aircraft-handling facilities and passenger amenities across its airports.The group entered the airport sector in 2019 after winning six airports in govt’s privatisation drive. Two years later, it acquired the Mumbai airport from GVK Group, expanding its footprint. It is set to operationalise the Navi Mumbai airport next week, its first greenfield airport project.Jeet (28), the younger son of group chairman Gautam Adani, is also preparing the airport business for a potential listing by 2030 through a demerger.The group has previously listed businesses such as power transmission and renewable energy through similar demergers, bypassing the traditional IPO route.Before a listing, however, the airport unit must meet key milestones, including turning cash positive. Housed under flagship Adani Enterprises, the unit is ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) positive. In FY25, it made an operating profit of Rs 3,480 crore.“Once the capex cycle slows and revenues start flowing from the Navi Mumbai airport, city side development such as retail, food and beverage, hotels, and from ongoing expansion, the business will become cash positive and will not need support from the parent,” said Jeet.For now, the group’s airport ambitions remain firmly domestic. Jeet said the group will focus on India for five years, following the cancellation of an airport contract in Kenya last year amid criticism over transparency.The Adani Group intends to bid for nearly a dozen airports slated for privatisation as part of its Rs 1 lakh-crore investment plan for aviation infrastructure over the next five years, group director Jeet Adani said.

‘To build one of India’s largest hotel portfolios’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/to-build-one-of-indias-largest-hotel-portfolios/articleshow/126087572.cms,"file photo

MUMBAI: Billionaire Gautam Adani is checking into hospitality in a big way, with plans to build “one of the country’s largest hotel portfolios”, anchored around his group’s airports and real estate assets.The move positions the group in direct competition with Tata Group’s Taj, ITC Hotels, and the Oberoi chain (in which Reliance Industries and ITC hold about 19% and 16% stakes, respectively).“We will have upwards of 60 hotels across our airports and real estate businesses. It’s like one of the largest hotel portfolios in the country,” Jeet Adani, director of Adani Group told TOI. “All the hotels will be developed by the group, with the exception of Sahara Star hotel (near Mumbai airport’s Terminal 1),” Jeet said.The group has expressed interest in acquiring Sahara Group’s 88 assets, including the landmark Sahara Star, and has already secured creditors’ approval to buy Jaypee Group assets, which include five hotels in northern India.Navi Mumbai will be a major focus. “We are building about 15 hotels in Navi Mumbai,” Jeet said, underscoring the scale of the group’s hospitality ambitions. The group will “tie up with international hotel operators” to manage these properties.The hospitality push is part of Adani Group’s broader city-side development plan, which includes retail, convention centres, and F&B outlets built alongside its airport terminals. The move is to shift away from dependence on aeronautical revenues, which are expected to fall to just 10% from nearly half today, as city-side development and airport lounges take centre stage.A large convention centre is planned for Mumbai, while Navi Mumbai will feature a smaller 25,000-seat arena, Jeet said. RIL’s Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai’s BKC, opened in 2022, is among the country’s largest such facilities.When asked if the group plans to hive off the hotel portfolio into a distinct entity, Jeet responded negatively. “Real estate will stay with Adani Realty and Adani Properties. Whatever is related to the airport will remain within the airport business. However, we have created a common management team to extract maximum value across both,” Jeet said.","The hospitality push is part of Adani Group’s broader city-side development plan.

Corp tax kitty surpasses personal I-T collections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/corp-tax-kitty-surpasses-personal-i-t-collections/articleshow/126087455.cms,"file photo

NEW DELHI: Corporation tax collections overtook the non-corporate tax mop-up, which went up 1.3%, pulling down the gross direct tax collections growth to 4.2% till mid-Dec with the overall kitty swelling past the Rs 20 lakh crore mark.Latest data released by the income tax department pegged corporation tax collections up to Dec 17 at Rs 9.94 lakh crore, 7.5% higher than a year ago, while non-corporation tax, which is personal income tax, was 1.3% higher at Rs 9.67 lakh crore.The latest numbers came after the third instalment of advance tax payments, which showed that non-corporate tax payments fell 6.5% to Rs 1.8 lakh crore, while corporation tax was 8% higher at a little under Rs 6.1 lakh crore.“Overall, the corporate advance tax increase signals good corporate earnings. Non-corporate advance tax collections have... declined possibly on the back of rate cuts for individuals given in the previous Budget,” said Rohinton Sidhwa, partner at consulting firm Deloitte India. The bad news is that refunds fell 13.5% to a little under Rs 3 lakh crore, resulting in a 8% rise in net direct tax collections to over Rs 17 lakh crore.“A pickup in refunds would weigh on the growth in net non-corporate tax collections in the remaining part of the fiscal. Overall, ICRA expects a sizeable miss in PIT collections relative to the FY2026 Budget target of Rs 13.6 lakh crore...,” said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar.","Corporation tax collections up to Dec 17 at Rs 9.94 lakh crore, 7.5% higher than a year ago.

MUMBAI: The rupee staged its strongest single-day rise since May 2025 on Friday, closing at 89.27 per dollar, up 97 paise from Thursday’s 90.24. It briefly moved above the 90-per-dollar mark late in the session. The gain capped a third straight advance after a run of record lows earlier in the month.The rupee saw sharp swings during the week ended Friday, sliding to successive record lows before staging a strong rebound on aggressive RBI intervention. Persistent foreign portfolio outflows and uncertainty over a potential US-India trade deal pushed the currency down to an intra-day low of 90.79 on Dec 15 and further to a lifetime low of 91.08 on Dec 16, with the rupee closing at 91.03. The trend reversed mid-week as the central bank stepped in, lifting the rupee to 90.38 on Dec 17, its biggest single-session gain in several months.The recovery gathered pace, with the rupee rising for a third straight day to close at 89.27 on Dec 19, marking its strongest daily gain since May and its best weekly rise, at around 1.2%, since June.RBI intervention drove the turnaround, traders said, citing heavy dollar sales near the 3:30 pm spot close, likely routed through a public sector bank.RBI had also stepped in earlier in the week when the rupee slid to an all-time low of 91.1. From that trough, the currency has rebounded about 2%, shifting near-term sentiment and deterring fresh speculative shorts.“The Indian rupee has ascended to the top of the Asian currency rankings, fuelled by a clutch of corporate dollar inflows and a pivot back toward risk-on sentiment. With the RBI likely engaging in proactive intervention, the short-term outlook for USD-INR has turned bearish. Key technical levels to watch include support at 89.25 and a ceiling at 89.90,” said Dilip Parmar of HDFC Securities.Dealers said that the suddenness and the scale of the intervention was a clear pointer that the central bank sees the recent bout of volatility as an outcome of speculative attack on the domestic currency.","The rupee staged its strongest single-day rise since May 2025 on Friday, closing at 89.27 per dollar.

At present, banks pay a premium of 12 paise for every Rs 100 of assessable deposits.Under the proposed framework, the current flat premium of 12 paise per Rs 100 of assessable deposits will be replaced with a risk-based structure in which banks with stronger capital adequacy, better asset quality and sound governance will pay lower premia, while weaker banks will pay higher ones.","The central board of Reserve Bank of India has approved a proposal to move to a risk-based pricing system for deposit insurance.

So, a little bit of employees will be Omanese, the rest can all be Indians… we (Indian investors) will not have to have diverse nationalities or take people from other nations. So, our investments will provide jobs to our people.”He said that the trade agreement is likely to be operationalised within three months and Oman has for the first time lifted the ban on the export of marble slabs, which will then be processed in India. “It will provide jobs to our brothers and sisters here and reduce imports from Türkiye.”","Naveen Jindal’s JSPL and Amul are likely to be among the initial investors in Oman.

RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

MUMBAI: For the first time since the monetary policy committee began setting interest rates in 2016, several members explicitly flagged the risks of inflation staying too low while backing a rate cut, minutes of the Dec 3-5 meeting showed.The MPC voted unanimously to cut policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%, citing a sharper-than-expected fall in inflation, especially food prices, and concerns that real interest rates had turned overly restrictive.RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said headline inflation had eased significantly and was likely to undershoot earlier projections due to ""exceptionally benign food prices"". With both headline and core inflation subdued, he said real interest rates needed to be lower to stimulate demand and support growth.Economist Ram Singh said inflation data made a strong and urgent case for another cut, arguing that a counter-cyclical, price-stabilising policy should move prices back toward target quickly. Delaying action would keep real rates unnecessarily high, hurting GDP growth . He also warned that prolonged low inflation could squeeze profit margins, raise the real burden of debt, and dampen private investment, with MSMEs particularly vulnerable due to limited pricing power and sticky wages.External member Nagesh Kumar pointed to headline inflation of 0.3% in Oct 2025 and a full-year FY26 projection of around 2% as creating room for policy action. He argued that inflation had fallen too low to be healthy for a developing economy, signalling a demand deficit, and said demand stimulus was needed to preserve growth momentum in the second half of FY26.Another external member Saugata Bhattacharya said ""I, as an individual member of the MPC, am risk averse to criticism of having ""fallen behind the curve"", particularly the mistake of attributing as ""transient"" those drivers of inflation which might ultimately emerge as structural components"".Deputy governor Poonam Gupta said the faster-than-anticipated moderation in headline CPI was the most important recent development for policy and deserved greater weight in deliberations given how low current and forecast inflation had become.Indranil Bhattacharyya, ED, RBI said calibrated easing, underway since Feb 2025, supported output stabilisation, while failure to adjust policy to evolving conditions risked higher macro volatility. Muted inflation, he added, suggested weak demand pressures at a time when growth was projected to slow.","The MPC voted unanimously to cut policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% citing a sharper-than-expected fall in inflation, especially food prices.

NEW DELHI: Delhi HC on Friday sought a response from Customs department on a plea filed by InterGlobe Aviation, the operator of IndiGo airline, seeking a refund of over Rs 900 crore paid as Customs duty on aircraft engines and parts re-imported into India after overseas repairs, reports Abhinav Garg.A bench of Justices V Kameswar Rao and Vinod Kumar issued notice to deputy commissioner (refund) and directed the authorities to file their response within two weeks. The court listed the matter for hearing in April next year.InterGlobe contended that the levy of Customs duty on such re-imports was unconstitutional and amounted to a double levy on the same transaction.Opposing the petition, the counsel for Customs department submitted that it was premature, noting that the issue on which the present claim is based is pending before the Supreme Court.However, counsel for the airline argued that at the time of re-import of aircraft engines and parts after repairs, the company paid basic Customs duty without any dispute. The counsel contended that since the repairs constituted a service, the airline also paid GST on a reverse charge basis. Despite this, Customs authorities insisted on levying duty again by treating the same transaction as an import of goods, the counsel claimed.","InterGlobe Aviation, the operator of IndiGo airline, seeking a refund of over Rs 900 crore paid as Customs duty on aircraft engines and parts re-imported into India after overseas repairs.

NEW DELHI: Govt on Friday directed IndiGo to start the process of compensating passengers affected by its massive flight disruptions this month at the earliest.The airline will, from Dec 26, start giving travel vouchers worth Rs 10,000 each to ""severely impacted customers who were stranded at airports for many hours"" on Dec 3, 4 and 5, apart from an additional Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 in accordance with govt norms.Aviation secretary Samir Sinha issued the directive during a review on Friday. ""Compensation payment should start within a week for passengers who booked tickets directly from IndiGo website as their data is already with the airline. IndiGo has been directed to collect information about people who booked tickets via travel agents and online travel agencies (OTA) from the latter and pay the compensation directly to passengers.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Also Read |

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill amid sustained opposition protests, leading to repeated disruptions and the adjournment of the House after a ruckus.The Bill, which replaces the 20-year-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act , seeks to provide a statutory guarantee of 125 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to undertake unskilled manual work.Moving the Bill for consideration and passage, Union rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the legislation would ensure employment and help fulfil Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of self-reliant villages. He said the VB-G RAM G Bill would ensure all-round development of villages, make them poverty-free and fuel their growth journey.Opposition parties, however, mounted a sharp attack on the government over the repeal and renaming of MGNREGA. Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra accused the government of undermining Gandhi’s legacy. She said the Bill was destroying the idea of Ram Rajya both in letter and spirit by repealing MGNREGA and renaming the scheme.Moitra also accused the government of “dishonouring” Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore by removing Gandhi’s name from the landmark rural employment law. Taking a swipe at the ruling dispensation, she said the Bill showed that the government believed in “Na kisi ka saath, na kisi ka vikas, na Rahim ka, na Ram ka”.Opposing the Bill, she said the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 had revolutionised rural India’s concept of livelihood security.Congress MP Jai Prakash said removing the name of the Father of the Nation from the legislation was “the biggest crime”. He claimed the proposed law would create fresh financial liabilities for states and deprive grassroots institutions such as gram sabhas of their right to decide on works under the scheme. He termed the Bill “anti-poor” and “anti-Dalit”, alleging it reflected a pro-rich approach.Speaker Om Birla had earlier said the debate on the Bill would take place on Wednesday, with the minister replying on Thursday before it was taken up for passage.Defending the legislation, BJP MP Brijmohan Agarwal said the previous Congress government had reduced MNREGA to a “dig the pit and cover the pit” scheme. He alleged it failed to strengthen the rural economy and led to large-scale corruption. Agarwal said the inclusion of “Ram” in the new law would deter corruption.According to the Bill, states will be required to frame schemes consistent with the new law within six months of the Act coming into force.",The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill.

"US monetary policy: Fed’s official sees no urgency for further rate cuts, flags distorted inflation data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-monetary-policy-feds-official-sees-no-urgency-for-further-rate-cuts-flags-distorted-inflation-data/articleshow/126080651.cms,"A senior US Federal Reserve official has said there is no immediate need to cut interest rates further, cautioning that recent inflation data may have been distorted due to disruptions in data collection during the federal government shutdown, AFP reported.Speaking to CNBC on Friday, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said inflation readings for recent months were likely affected because government agencies were unable to collect price data in October and the first half of November amid the record-long shutdown.“Because of that, I think the data were distorted in some of the categories, and that pushed down the consumer price index reading probably by a tenth or so,” Williams said, adding that it was difficult to precisely quantify the impact.He said inflation data for December could provide a clearer picture of the extent of the distortion.Williams’ remarks followed the release of a delayed US consumer price index report earlier this week, which showed inflation easing to 2.7 per cent in November from 3 per cent in September. Several economists had warned that the figures may not fully reflect underlying price pressures.Some analysts pointed out that a higher share of price quotes may have been collected during the Black Friday discount period, potentially biasing the data downward — a concern Williams echoed.Asked how the latest data influenced his outlook on interest rates, Williams said the Fed’s policy stance was appropriate for now.“I don’t personally have a sense of urgency to need to act further on monetary policy right now,” he said, adding that the rate cuts already delivered had positioned policymakers well.The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year as the labour market weakened, but has signalled a higher threshold for additional easing. The central bank’s next policy meeting is scheduled for late January.",US Federal Reserve official says there is no immediate need to cut interest rates further.

‘Mess Like This…’: Trump Addresses America, Makes Big Statement On Venezuela

US President Donald Trump has suspended the diversity green card lottery programme, saying it allowed the suspect in the deadly Brown University and MIT shootings to enter the United States, as his administration moved to tighten legal immigration channels following the attacks.Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said on X that, at Trump’s direction, she had ordered US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the programme. “This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” Noem said, referring to Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.Neves Valente, 48, is suspected of killing two students and wounding nine others in a shooting at Brown University, and of killing an MIT professor in a separate attack.He was found dead on Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said, according to news agency AP.Court documents cited by AP show that Neves Valente first entered the US on a student visa in 2000 to study at Brown University.He later obtained a diversity immigrant visa in 2017 and was granted lawful permanent resident status the same year. It remains unclear where he was between taking a leave of absence from Brown in 2001 and receiving the visa in 2017.The diversity visa lottery makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year to applicants from countries underrepresented in the US, many of them in Africa.Nearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 lottery, with just over 131,000 selected including family members, as per AP. Portuguese citizens received only 38 slots.The programme was created by Congress, and its suspension is expected to face legal challenges.Trump has long opposed the lottery, and Noem’s announcement marks the latest instance of using a violent incident to push immigration policy changes, reported The Guardian.Neves Valente studied physics at Brown before withdrawing and that investigators linked him to the killing of MIT professor Nuno Loureiro through surveillance footage and vehicle records.","US President Donald Trump has suspended the diversity green card lottery programme.

South Korea's Kospi also inched 33 points to 4,028 at 11:03 AM IST.Data released overnight showed US inflation slowed last month to its lowest level since July and came in well below market expectations. The figures helped steady investor sentiment after concerns grew in recent weeks over the outlook for monetary easing following the Federal Reserve’s policy decision last week.While traders had earlier scaled back expectations of a fourth straight rate cut in January, the latest data revived hopes of further easing. According to Bloomberg News, markets are now pricing in a 20 percent chance of a rate cut next month, with two reductions expected by the end of 2026.However, analysts cautioned that the inflation figures may not present a clear picture. The data was collected during the longest-ever US government shutdown, which ended in mid-November, potentially skewing the results.Economists at Bank of America said “we recommend taking (the) report with a large grain of salt”, pointing to “shutdown-related distortions”.Even so, Wall Street reacted positively, with all three major indices closing higher. US stocks have been under pressure recently as investors question when returns will materialise from the vast amounts of capital poured into artificial intelligence, fuelling talk of a possible bubble in the technology sector.Those concerns were partly soothed on Thursday after Micron Technology reported a sharp surge in profits, with quarterly earnings nearly tripling to $5.2 billion.

TOKYO: The Bank of Japan hiked interest rates to a 30-year high of 0.75 per cent on Friday, the first increase since January, as it said the economy had shown signs of improvement.The unanimous vote to lift the main borrowing rate from 0.5 per cent came hours after official data showed the country's core inflation rate held steady in November but still well above policymakers' target.The yen weakened slightly against the dollar after the widely expected announcement, which puts rates at their highest since 1995.""Japan's economy has recovered moderately,"" bank officials wrote in a report explaining the decision. ""While uncertainties remain regarding the US economy and the impact of trade policy in each jurisdiction, these uncertainties have declined.""Yields on Japanese government bonds have risen in recent weeks on worries about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's budget discipline, while the yen has weakened.The core consumer price index -- which excludes volatile fresh food -- came in at three percent in November, the same rate as the previous month and in line with expectations. However, it is well above the BoJ's two percent goal, as it has been for some time.Takaichi, who formally took power in October, has made fighting inflation a major priority.Her government this week succeeded in getting parliament approval for an extra budget worth 18.3 trillion yen ($118 billion) to finance a massive stimulus package.She has long advocated for more government spending and loose monetary policy to spur growth.Since taking office, however, she has said monetary policy decisions should be left to the BoJ.The bank began hiking rates from below zero in March last year as figures signalled an end to the country's ""lost decades"" of stagnation, with inflation surging.However, with worries about the global outlook and US tariffs growing, it paused at the start of 2025, with the last increase in January taking rates to their highest level in 17 years.The inflation figures for November showed rice prices jumped 37 per cent year-on-year, the internal affairs ministry said.The cost of rice has skyrocketed because of supply problems linked to a very hot summer in 2023 and panic-buying after a ""megaquake"" warning last year, amongst other factors.Japan's economy contracted 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, but BoJ governor Kazuo Ueda said last week that the impact of US tariffs was less than feared.""So far, US corporates have swallowed the burden of tariffs without fully passing (them) through to consumer prices,"" he told the Financial Times.","Bank of Japan raises interest rates to a 30-year high of 0.75 per cent.

Explaining the rational behind the permission, he said that exporting American chips would help US companies retain an edge over Chinese chipmakers by reducing the appetite for dragon's chips.However, despite the announcement, uncertainty still surrounds the pace of approvals and whether Chinese authorities would permit local firms to purchase the chips. The move has also drawn sharp criticism from China hawks across the US political spectrum, who argue that the technology could enhance Beijing’s military capabilities and weaken the US lead in artificial intelligence, Reuters reported.According to the sources, the commerce department has forwarded licence applications related to the proposed chip exports to the state, energy and defense departments as part of a mandatory inter-agency review.Under US export regulations, the departments have 30 days to submit their assessments.One administration official stressed that the process would be comprehensive, saying it was “not some perfunctory box we are checking.” However, the regulations, the final green signal still remains with the president.While the White House declined to comment directly on the review, a spokesperson said “the Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack – without compromising on national security.”The potential policy is a transition from the approach taken under former president Joe Biden, whose administration imposed extensive restrictions on exports of advanced AI chips to China and other countries it saw as possible transit points for smuggling, citing national security concerns.It also contrasts sharply with Trump’s stance during his first term, when he moved aggressively to restrict China’s access to US technology. At the time, Trump pointed to allegations that China steals American intellectual property and uses commercially obtained technology to strengthen its military, accusations that Beijing has denied.Former national security officals have firmly opposed the move saying that large chip outflows to China would be ‘a significant strategic mistake,’” said Chris McGuire, who served on the White House National Security Council under President Joe Biden and is now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He told Reuters that the chips are “the one thing holding China back in AI.”“I cannot possibly fathom how the departments of Commerce, State, Energy, and Defense could certify that exporting these chips to China is in the U.S. national security interest,” he added.Officials backing the policy within the Trump administration argue the exports could have the opposite effect. Led by White House AI czar David Sacks, they say selling advanced chips to China would discourage domestic firms such as Huawei from intensifying efforts to close the gap with Nvidia and AMD’s most advanced designs.Reuters reported last week that Nvidia is considering ramping up production of the H200 chips, which sit just below its flagship Blackwell processors, after initial orders from China exceeded existing manufacturing capacity. Although the H200 is slower than the Blackwell chips across many AI applications, it remains widely used and has never previously been approved for sale in China.Trump had earlier indicated that he was open to allowing exports of a less advanced version of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, but later reversed that position and moved instead to approve potential sales of the H200.",The US government has began a formal licensing process that could pave the way for chip gaint's Beijing entry. This comes after US President Donald Trump recently committed to permit sales. But uncertainty still surrounds the pace of approvals and whether Chinese authorities would permit local firms to purchase the chips.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126068702,imgsize-204906,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
TikTok row: US joint venture deal signed to avert Chinese ownership ban; ByteDance's stake capped at 19.9%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-row-us-joint-venture-deal-signed-to-avert-chinese-ownership-ban-bytedances-stake-capped-at-19-9/articleshow/126068476.cms,"Representative image

TikTok has signed a joint venture agreement with major investors to keep its platform running in the United States and avoid a potential ban linked to its Chinese ownership, according to an internal memo seen by news agency AFP.TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew told employees that the company and its parent ByteDance have agreed to form a new US-based entity, backed by Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investor MGX.The deal is aimed at meeting the requirements of a 2024 US law that mandates the sale of TikTok’s American operations or a shutdown of the app.Under the arrangement, American and global investors will hold just over 80 per cent of the new joint venture, while ByteDance will retain a 19.9 per cent stake — the maximum ownership allowed for a Chinese company under the law, reported Reuters.Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will each own 15 per cent, while affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will hold around 30 per cent.Chew said the US joint venture would operate as an independent entity with authority over “US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance”.He added that the venture would have “the exclusive right and authority to provide assurances that content, software and data for American users is secure”, as per AFP.Oracle will serve as TikTok’s “trusted security partner”, responsible for auditing compliance and safeguarding sensitive US user data, which will be stored on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure in the United States, Reuters reported.The new entity will also oversee certain commercial operations, including advertising, marketing and e-commerce, while TikTok’s US entities will manage global product interoperability.The agreement is set to close on January 22, 2026, though Chew told staff that more work remains before completion.The memo marks the first confirmation that TikTok has formally signed on to a deal framework unveiled by the White House in September, AFP noted.The move follows years of pressure from US lawmakers, who have argued that TikTok could be used by Beijing to access Americans’ data or influence public opinion through its algorithm.US President Donald Trump, who initially pushed for a ban during his first term, repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive orders since his return to the White House.He has credited TikTok, which has over 170 million US users, with helping him win re-election.Trump has publicly backed the new arrangement, previously naming Oracle founder Larry Ellison — a longtime ally — as a key figure in the deal.Ellison has recently re-emerged in the spotlight through major media and technology investments, AFP reported.The deal has drawn criticism from some US politicians. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said there were still unanswered questions, accusing Trump of allowing a “billionaire takeover” of TikTok, as reported by Reuters.Despite the concerns, analysts quoted by Reuters said the agreement is likely to clear regulatory hurdles, given the level of involvement by the White House in shaping the transaction.",TikTok has signed a joint venture agreement with major investors to keep its platform running in the United States.

America's holiday season: Festive spending hit as consumers struggle with affordability woes — Here's what report revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/americas-holiday-season-festive-spending-hit-as-consumers-struggle-with-affordability-woes-heres-what-report-revealed/articleshow/126067563.cms,"Americans are rethinking their celebration spending this festive season as household budgets remain under pressure. A large share of the public says that affording holiday purchases this year is proving difficult. Rising costs compared with last year are prompting many to cut down on gifts, leisure activities and travel. At the same time, this strain is most evident among those who feel prices have climbed sharply, highlighting the deep financial divides that have long existed in the country, CBS News reported.Americans who describe their finances in good shape, often those on higher incomes, generally say they can manage seasonal expenses more comfortably. Even among this group, however, there is widespread opinion that the cost of goods and services has gone up, making the holidays more expensive overall.The data from CBS poll shows that only 8% of Americans find that the things they buy for holidays are very easy to afford, while 34% find them somewhat easy to afford. In contrast, a larger share report financial strain, with 41% saying holiday purchases are somewhat difficult to afford and 17% describing them as very difficult to afford.Financial worries are also impacting how people experience this Christmas. While the holidays are typically linked with joy and thankfulness, those struggling to pay for essentials are far more likely to associate the period with stress. Financial pressure, for many, is dampening what would otherwise be a time of celebration.According to the CBS poll, 48% of people felt geatful, 43% felt happy and 29% felt excited. However, 39% of Americans felt stressed, 29% felt exhausted and 23% were feeling sad.With the holiday rush nearing, many consumers have reported that at least gas prices in their area are falling rather than rising, a shift not seen earlier in the year, according to CBS News.In October, 34% of Americans said that gas prices in their area were going up, 12% said they were going down, and 38% felt they were staying the same. Now, fewer people, 20%, say prices are rising, while a much larger 32% report that gas prices are falling, and 33% say they are unchanged.Even so, lower fuel costs have not been enough to significantly change spending behaviour.Only a small proportion of Americans expect to increase spending on gifts, entertainment, flights, or food and drink compared with previous years. Those who find it hard to afford holiday items are especially inclined to scale back while those holding spending steady or planning to spend more are largely those who say their financial position is sound.Though public confidence in the economy has remained weak in 2025, the year has highlighted a persistent split between Americans who feel financially secure and those who do not. For higher-income households, stock market plays an important role in their finances. However, lower-income groups are more affected by rising prices and inflation.The figures show that most Americans feel their income is not keeping pace with inflation. In February, 23% said their income was keeping up, compared with 77% who said it was not. This changed little in July, when 25% felt their income was keeping up and 75% said it was not. Now, 24% say their income is keeping pace with inflation, while 76% say it is not.According to CBS News, almost half of Americans agree that their financial situation is good, while the other half says it is bad, a balance that has remained consistent over the years. Among those who saw their situation changing, more people say it worsened rather than improved, though improvements were more common among higher earners.As 2025 approaches its end, inflation continues to remain a dominant concern. Around three-quarters of Americans throughout the year said their incomes were not keeping pace with rising prices. Views of the overall economy continue to be negative, and opinions on the job market are also unfavourable on balance.","A large share of the public says that affording holiday purchases this year is proving difficult.

Japan inflation holds steady ahead of BoJ rate decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-inflation-holds-steady-ahead-of-boj-rate-decision/articleshow/126067543.cms,"Japan's inflation rate held steady in November, official data showed Friday ahead of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision which could see central bankers raise interest rates to their highest level in 30 years.The hike would be the first since January and could potentially exacerbate turmoil in debt markets.Yields on Japanese government bonds have risen in recent weeks on worries about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's budget discipline, while the yen has weakened.The core consumer price index -- which excludes volatile fresh food -- rose three percent in November, the same rate as a month earlier, in line with market expectations.Takaichi, who formally took power in October, has promised to fight inflation as a major priority.Her government succeeded in getting parliament approval for an extra budget worth 18.3 trillion yen ($118 billion) this week to finance her massive stimulus package.She has long advocated for more government spending and easy monetary policy to spur growth.Since taking office, however, she has said monetary policy decisions should be left to the Bank of Japan (BoJ).The BoJ began hiking rates from below zero in March last year as figures signalled an end to the country's ""lost decades"" of stagnation, with inflation surging.However, with worries about the global outlook and US tariffs growing, the bank paused its tightening measures at the start of 2025, with the last increase in January taking rates to their highest level in 17 years.The inflation figures for November showed rice prices up 37 percent year-on-year, the internal affairs ministry said.Rice prices have skyrocketed because of supply problems linked to a very hot summer in 2023 and panic-buying after a ""megaquake"" warning last year, amongst other factors.Japan's economy contracted 0.6 percent in the third quarter, but BoJ governor Kazuo Ueda said last week that the impact of US tariffs was less than feared.""So far, US corporates have swallowed the burden of tariffs without fully passing (them) through to consumer prices,"" Ueda told the Financial Times.At the same time, inflation has been above the BoJ's target of two percent for some time.The majority of economists polled by Bloomberg expect the BoJ to raise its main rate from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, which would be the highest since 1995.","Japan's inflation rate held steady in November, official data showed Friday.

US inflation data: Prices cool in November after shutdown-hit report; relief yet to reach households,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-data-prices-cool-in-november-after-shutdown-hit-report-relief-yet-to-reach-households/articleshow/126062350.cms,"Photo- AP

US inflation cooled more than expected in November, but economists cautioned that the data may have been distorted by the recent federal government shutdown, while most Americans said they were yet to feel any real relief from high prices for essentials, AP reported.The US Labor Department said on Thursday that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in November, lower than forecasts and down from 3% in September. The reading, however, remained well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target, underscoring persistent cost pressures in the economy.The inflation report itself was delayed by eight days because of the 43-day federal shutdown, which also disrupted data collection and prevented the release of CPI numbers for October. As a result, investors, businesses and policymakers received their first official inflation update since late September.Economists warned that the figures should be interpreted with caution. Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, said the data were “likely a bit distorted” due to the shutdown. “The good news is that it’s cooling,” she said, adding that the disruption to government operations and contracting could itself have temporarily dampened price pressures.Similar concerns were raised by Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, who described the November inflation numbers as “noisy”. She said the absence of October data made month-on-month comparisons impossible and the truncated data-gathering process could have introduced systematic biases.As a result, many economists said a clearer picture of inflation trends may only emerge with the December CPI report, due to be released in mid-January, shortly before the Fed’s next policy meeting.While headline inflation eased, energy prices rose 4.2% in November, driven by higher fuel oil costs. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 2.6% year-on-year, its lowest level since March 2021.Despite the moderation in inflation, consumer sentiment remained strained. High prices for groceries, insurance, utilities and housing have continued to weigh on households, a factor that analysts say has had political repercussions as well.An AP-NORC poll showed that most US adults had noticed unusually high prices for basic goods and holiday purchases in recent months. Roughly half said it was harder than usual to afford gifts, while many reported delaying major purchases or cutting back on non-essential spending.Inflation pressures have been partly attributed to President Donald Trump’s import tariffs, which imposed double-digit taxes on a broad range of imports, alongside targeted duties on steel, aluminium and automobiles. While the tariffs have proved less inflationary than initially feared, economists said they continue to exert upward pressure on prices and complicate the Fed’s policy decisions.The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates for the third time this year, but signalled it may opt for just one rate cut in 2026, as it balances easing inflation against signs of a slowing job market.Tariffs have also added to uncertainty for businesses. Footwear maker Wolverine Worldwide said higher import costs had forced it to raise prices on some products and freeze hiring and investment. Its chief executive Christopher Hufnagel said the unpredictability of tariff policy had made long-term planning increasingly difficult.","US inflation cooled more than expected in November, but economists cautioned that the data may have been distorted by the recent federal government shutdown.

What Does It Mean For Global Crude Oil Market?

Venezuelan Merey differentials against ICE Brent in China

US President Donald Trump’s latest escalation in tensions and blockade of Venezuela oil tankers may have little impact on the global crude oil market, believes global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler. “The move has so far failed to provide a meaningful boost to oil prices or to overturn underlying fundamentals, largely because the market is two-tiered and even the sanctioned segment remains crowded,” says Kpler in its latest report.In 2025, Venezuela is producing approximately 900,000 barrels per day (kbd) of crude oil and condensate, which makes up about 1% of the global oil supply. Of the 765,000 barrels per day that Venezuela exports, around 76% is sent to China, specifically to independent refiners known as teapot refiners. This is because state-owned companies are avoiding these shipments due to concerns over sanctions.The United States has received about 17% of Venezuela's exports this year, a decrease from 35% in 2024, following changes to Chevron’s license. The rest of the exports are sent to Cuba and a few other countries like Spain and Italy under previous agreements.On Tuesday, Trump announced a ""blockade"" on all sanctioned oil tankers traveling to and from Venezuela.This move is part of America’s ongoing efforts to increase pressure on Nicolas Maduro's government by targeting its primary revenue source.Details on how Trump plans to enforce this blockade on the sanctioned vessels remain unclear. It is also uncertain whether he will deploy the Coast Guard to intercept these ships. The Trump administration has already positioned thousands of troops and nearly a dozen warships, including an aircraft carrier, in the region.Trump said on Truth Social, ""For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela.""The increased US pressure on Venezuela might have added some geopolitical risk to Brent crude prices. However, this is unlikely to significantly change overall market sentiment, says Kpler. The reason is simple: disruptions to Venezuelan supply impact only a small group of buyers, and the global market is well-supplied to handle any potential shortages from US actions.Trump’s statement about blocking “all sanctioned oil tankers” suggests that shipments considered legitimate, such as those going to the US under Chevron’s license, might continue without disruption. This indicates that Venezuelan oil supplies to sanctioned markets could face interruptions, while shipments to the US would likely remain unaffected, points out Kpler.However, cargoes headed to China and Cuba could be hit. According to data from Kpler, Cuba imports about 28,000 barrels per day of crude oil in 2025, with roughly 35% coming from Venezuela. Most of the rest is supplied by Mexico, with Russia and Algeria each providing one shipment.If Venezuela's supply becomes unreliable, Cuba might see immediate challenges. However, with the availability of Russian oil—despite recent US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil—Cuba could potentially look to Russia to make up for any shortfall.Chinese teapot refiners are likely to feel the effects of any oil blockade due to their reliance on Venezuelan crude. However, the impact of shipment disruptions is expected to be lessened by the high volumes of Venezuelan oil currently in transit and the ample supply from Iran, Russia, and other non-sanctioned producers, says Kpler.Market sources quoted in the Kpler report indicate that prompt Venezuelan Merey cargoes are trading at about $15 below ICE Brent on a delivered China basis, even after the US seized a Venezuelan oil tanker last week. Sellers have attempted to raise prices to around $13 below ICE Brent, but the abundant Iranian supply and a sharp drop in Russian oil prices in China have kept Venezuelan prices from rising.Many Iranian heavy cargoes, such as Pars (around $12.5 below ICE Brent) and Iran Heavy (around $11.5 below ICE Brent), remain unsold, which is likely to limit any increase in Venezuelan prices in China. Both the sanctioned and non-sanctioned oil markets are experiencing a significant supply surplus, with buyers becoming less sensitive to geopolitical developments.According to Kpler data, the floating storage of Iranian, Venezuelan, and Russian crude oil has reached a combined 74 million barrels this week, the highest level since November 2022.","US President Donald Trump's latest escalation in tensions and blockade of Venezuela oil tankers may have little impact on the global crude oil market, says Kpler.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed over 350 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained around 1.4%, led by technology and semiconductor shares.Investor sentiment improved after data showed US inflation slowed to 2.7% last month, coming in below economists’ expectations. While inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, the softer reading raised hopes that the central bank could continue cutting interest rates next year to support a slowing job market.Some caution persisted with market participants noting that recent economic data have been volatile following the US government shutdown, and that upcoming inflation reports may provide a clearer signal.Technology stocks got a further boost from Micron Technology, which surged nearly 16% after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue and issuing an upbeat outlook. Chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra said demand linked to artificial intelligence accelerated across Micron’s businesses, reinforcing its role as a key “AI enabler”.The results helped ease worries that heavy spending on AI by major companies may not yield sufficient returns.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

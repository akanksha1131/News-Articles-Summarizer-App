US Fed Meeting: Top Highlights & Takeaways

Recent economic indicators point towards sustained robust growth in economic activity, despite fluctuations in net exports affecting the data, the policy statement said.

US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

US Fed has forecasted higher inflation and lower US GDP growth. Officials at the Federal Reserve anticipate that inflation, based on their preferred measurement, will increase to 3% towards the end of this year, compared to 2.1% recorded in April.

Their projections indicate the unemployment rate will climb to 4.5%, up from the present rate of 4.2%.

The US GDP growth is expected to come down to 1.4% this year, showing a significant reduction from the previous year's 2.5%.

Labour market stability persists with low unemployment rates and steady employment conditions. Price levels continue to show moderate elevation, it said.

Whilst economic uncertainty has decreased, it still remains elevated. The Committee maintains vigilance regarding risks to both aspects of its dual mandate.

The Committee continues to evaluate incoming data's implications for economic prospects whilst determining suitable monetary policy stance. Should any risks surface that might hinder achieving the Committee's objectives, they stand ready to modify monetary policy accordingly. The evaluations encompass diverse factors, including labour market status, inflation metrics and expectations, alongside financial and global economic trends, the statement added.

US Fed Chair Defies Donald Trump

US Fed Meeting: The US Federal Reserve, led by chair Jerome Powell, kept interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, defying President Donald Trump ’s call for a rate cut.“In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the US Federal Reserve statement reads.The US central bank has maintained its key interest rate steady in the current year, ranging between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent. Market observers had widely anticipated that Fed officials will maintain their current position until inflation shows consistent signs of moderation.During the Federal Reserve's second day of meetings, Trump intensified his demands for interest rate cuts, directing criticism at Federal Reserve Chairman Powell whilst dismissing inflation concerns.""We have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed, he probably won't cut today,"" Trump remarked about Powell, making these comments just hours before the Federal Reserve's scheduled announcement.""We have no inflation, we have only success, and I'd like to see interest rates get down,"" he continued whilst speaking at the White House. ""Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself?""Inflation has shown a downward trend since January, and economic experts indicate that without elevated import duties, the Federal Reserve would be implementing further rate reductions.The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of Powell regarding borrowing costs, with Trump directly referring to the Fed chair as a ""numbskull"" for not implementing cuts. Additional administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have joined in advocating for rate reductions.Economists express concern when there is pressure on the Fed to reduce rates solely to decrease government interest payments, as this could compromise the Fed's congressional responsibility to maintain price stability and maximum employment.Trump has expressed dissatisfaction that the Fed maintains rates whilst other global central banks have decreased their borrowing costs, including those in Europe, Canada, and the UK. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan maintained its short-term rate at 0.5%, following a recent increase.The European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England have implemented rate reductions this year partly due to US tariffs affecting their economies. Meanwhile, the US economy remains predominantly robust, with low unemployment levels.","US Fed has penciled in two rate cuts later this year - a total of 50 basis points cut as per median forecast.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 went above 25,100, BSE Sensex moved up over 1,000 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,112.40, up 319 points or 1.29%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,408.17, up 1,046 points or 1.29%.Indian benchmark indices demonstrated a robust recovery on Friday, ending a three-day decline, primarily driven by financial sector gains following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) revised provisioning guidelines for project financing. The positive momentum, however, faces potential constraints due to ongoing Middle East conflicts.The rally was spearheaded by strong performances in Nifty Bank, Financial Services, Auto, and Metal sectors. The broader market indicators, including Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices, showed improvement of nearly 0.8% following Thursday's considerable downturn.Additionally, the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies increased by Rs 3.57 lakh crore, reaching Rs 446.37 lakh crore, according to an ET report.On Thursday, the RBI issued comprehensive guidelines for project financing, consolidating various existing circulars and standardising regulations across banks, NBFCs, and co-operative banks.""In comparison with the May-2024 draft proposal of 5% standard assets provisioning for under-construction projects, the 1.0%/1.25% provisioning for Infra/CRE projects under the final regulations gives a much-needed breather to project financiers, including REC and PFC,"" Emkay Global's analyst Avinash Singh said.The reduced provisioning requirements are expected to decrease funding expenses for infrastructure and real estate projects, creating advantages for lending institutions.The Federal Reserve maintained current interest rates whilst confirming its forecast of two rate reductions in 2025. Global markets responded favourably to the central bank's indication of future monetary easing, despite elevated inflation projections.The equity markets found solace in the proposed rate cuts, even as the US faces forecasts of reduced GDP growth (1.4%) and higher inflation (3%) for the upcoming year.The dollar index fell to 98.57, following a 0.34% decrease. This weakening typically benefits emerging market equities, including India, as it encourages foreign investment flows and strengthens the rupee.The US 10-year Treasury yield remained stable at 4.389%, whilst the 2-year yield decreased by 2 basis points to 3.925%.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have shifted to net purchasing, acquiring equities worth Rs 1,824 crore in the previous two sessions.Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) maintained their robust purchasing pattern for the twelfth straight day, investing Rs 2,566 crore, thereby providing additional market support.","BSE Sensex closed at 82,408.17, up 1,046 points or 1.29%.

(AI image)

Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:

Gold Price Outlook

From a technical standpoint, the current setup favors a ""Sell on Rise"" strategy around the ₹99,000–₹99,150 levels. Here's why:

Conclusion:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have shown a weak trend in the past few days. Where are gold rates headed in the near-term and what should investors of gold do?Gold prices opened with a significant gap-down in the June 20 session, reflecting prevailing weakness in COMEX Gold, and continue to trade with a bearish tone in domestic markets. The MCX Gold August Futures contract (05AUG2025) is currently quoting near ₹98,722 after touching an intraday low of ₹98,705, indicating persistent selling pressure at higher levels.1. EMA Resistance Levels: The 8-period EMA is currently placed at ₹99,150, and the 21-period EMA is at ₹99,350. Prices are trading well below both averages, signaling a clear short-term downtrend. Any intraday pullback toward these levels is likely to attract fresh selling.2. Bollinger Bands: The price action is hugging the lower Bollinger Band, a typical sign of trend continuation in strong bearish momentum. There’s no indication of mean reversion yet, which suggests that rallies may be limited and short-lived.3. Pivot Points: The previous day’s pivot level near ₹99,200–₹99,350 now acts as a key resistance zone.Failure to reclaim this zone reinforces the bearish outlook.4. RSI (14): The Relative Strength Index is hovering near 32.75, which is close to the oversold region but not yet showing signs of bullish divergence. This supports the argument for further weakness before any meaningful reversal.5. MACD: The MACD indicator is strongly negative with the MACD line at -34.71 and the histogram indicating increasing bearish momentum. The signal line remains far below zero, indicating a continuation of the downward trend.6. Price Action & Gap Analysis: Today’s gap-down open confirms a breakdown from the range-bound structure observed between June 17–19. This price gap indicates strong selling interest, likely due to pressure in international gold prices and a firmer dollar index.Traders are advised to follow a Sell on Rise approach as long as prices remain below the ₹99,150–₹99,350 resistance zone. The immediate downside targets lie near ₹98,300 and further lower toward ₹98,000 if the bearish sentiment intensifies. A stop loss can be considered above ₹99,500 to protect against unexpected short-covering rallies.","Gold prices opened with a significant gap-down in the June 20 session, reflecting prevailing weakness in COMEX Gold.

According to Bajaj Broking Research,

are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for June 20, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in a range as investors remain on the edge amid intensifying geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

From a structural standpoint, a sustained breakout and close above the 56,000 psychological marks would be essential to unlock further upside potential, with the index likely to gravitate towards the 56,600–57,000 resistance zone. However, failure to clear this overhead supply zone could result in continued range-bound action, with price oscillating between 56,000 and 55,000, shifting market attention to stock-specific alpha generation.

On the flip side, a decisive break down below the 55,000 levels would negate the ongoing consolidation structure and trigger a corrective move towards the critical support cluster at 54,500–54,000. This zone represents a confluence of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the key Fibonacci retracement zone of the prior impulse leg (53,483–57,049).

Stock market recommendations:Paras Defence and Space Technologies, and Thirumalai ChemicalsInvestor sentiment remains fragile amid intensifying geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which have catalyzed a rally in Brent crude prices. This presents a significant macroeconomic overhang for India, given its substantial reliance on crude imports, thereby casting a shadow over forward earnings visibility for India Inc. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve, in its recent policy review, maintained the federal funds rate within the target range of 4.25%–4.50%, aligning with market consensus. The Fed reiterated its forward guidance for 2025, signaling a data-dependent stance with no imminent pivot in sight.On the domestic front, the benchmark index continues to exhibit a phase of time-wise correction, consolidating within a well-demarcated range of 24,400–25,200 for the fifth successive week. The price action suggests a lack of directional conviction, indicative of a range-bound market structure.On the upside, 25,000 remains a critical supply zone. A sustained breakout and close above this resistance threshold could trigger momentum-driven upside towards the upper boundary of the consolidation band at 25,200.However, failure to absorb supply at this level may extend the prevailing sideways trajectory.On the downside, immediate support is situated at 24,700. A decisive breach below this inflection point could intensify selling pressure, potentially dragging the index towards the lower end of the consolidation band in the 24,500–24,400 range.Key support is anchored in the 24,500–24,400 zone, which marks a confluence of the 50-day EMA and the lower boundary of the five-week consolidation range, making it a crucial demand zone for the index. Only a breach below the lower band amid further escalation of geopolitical tension will signal acceleration of the decline towards 24,000 levels.The stock is at the cusp of breaking above the falling trendline joining the highs of May and June 2025 signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is currently seen rebounding after a base formation above the 20 days EMA signaling overall positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 1790 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the previous decline (1945-1540).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a rounding formation and is seen sustaining above the short- and medium-term moving averages thus supports the positive bias.The daily MACD is in uptrend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 319 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline (395-201).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, these are the top stock picks for today.

It is a centre of gravity for countries seeking mutual respect and non-interference,” said Alipov, rejecting suggestions that the group was being shaped as an anti-West coalition, reported PTI. He noted that trade in national currencies was already underway between BRICS members.India’s BRICS Sherpa and Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs, Dammu Ravi, said discussions around a BRICS common currency are “at a very early stage.”“Today, for now, we are only looking at trade settlement in national currencies. Harmonisation of fiscal and monetary policies is very, very difficult to achieve,” he said.Brazilian Ambassador Kenneth da Nobrega echoed the sentiment, adding that while deeper integration like a common currency requires years of policy alignment, local currency trade was already showing results. “It’s a long way. But trading in local currencies? That’s already working,” Nobrega said.The summit comes amid geopolitical unease following warnings by President Donald Trump against any formal move by BRICS nations to undermine the US dollar’s dominance in global trade. The Trump administration’s tariffs have already drawn concern among developing economies.The summit is set to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and leaders of newly inducted members such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Indonesia.Ambassador Ina Krisnamurthi of Indonesia called for systemic reform, saying, “Our international order, the rules-based system, is crashing into the limits of its founding vision.” She said BRICS must evolve from “just dialogue to delivery,” focusing on climate finance, humanitarian relief, and data equity.“Right now, the Global South represents 85 per cent of the world’s population and 39 per cent of global GDP,” Krisnamurthi noted. “Yet multilateral institutions do not reflect this reality.”Citing a surge in the middle class across India, China and ASEAN, she said: “In 2000, only 150 million enjoyed middle-class living standards. Today, that number is 1.5 billion — double the total population of Western countries.”Egyptian envoy Kamel Galal said Cairo had always seen itself as a natural part of the bloc. “We are keen that the group should focus on areas of cooperation that enjoy consensus, rather than divisive issues,” he said, stressing a development-first agenda for Africa and the Middle East.Touching on global flashpoints like Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and Sudan, Galal called for reforming global institutions to better reflect “the evolving dynamics and rising role of developing countries.”Quoting the Egyptian Book of the Dead, he added, “What I hate is ignorance, smallness of imagination, the eye that sees no further than its own idol. All things are possible. Who you are is limited by who you think you are.”Replacing the oft-cited “conflict, crisis and challenge” narrative, Galal proposed a new vision for BRICS: “collaboration, complementarity, consensus and cohesion.”The panel concluded with a Q&A session that focused on the institutional future of BRICS, prospects of a unified currency, and the bloc’s ambitions under the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework.",Senior diplomats from leading member nations said the grouping is likely to intensify efforts toward settling trade in national currencies.

NEW DELHI: Gross direct tax collections rose less than 5% to Rs 5,45,207 crore during the fiscal year up to June 19. The first of the four instalments of advance tax receipts increased at a muted 3.9%, raising fears of a sharp slowdown in the growth in corporate profits during the June quarter.On a net basis, direct tax collections were 1.4% lower at a little under Rs 4.6 lakh crore, but that was on account of a 58% jump in refunds, which added up to Rs 58,385 crore. The spike in refunds comes amidst finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's clear missive to ensure that officials don't sit on refunds, a message she delivered to the indirect tax brass on Friday and which is likely to be reiterated to top income tax officials in the coming week.Typically, advance tax payments are seen as a barometer of corporate health with some individuals also required to pay. The changes in personal tax may have played a part too. ""The revised tax slabs and reduced personal tax rates that came into effect from April 1, 2025, have provided relief to salaried individuals, and this is naturally reflected in lower TDS collections. On the corporate front, we're seeing the impact of increased capital expenditure by businesses.As companies invest in expansion and infrastructure, they benefit from higher depreciation claims, which temporarily lower taxable profits. This is a healthy sign of forward-looking investment behaviour,"" said Samir Kanabar, tax partner at consulting firm EY India.In recent months, industrial output has seen a slowdown although GST numbers have been steady.""Tax collections for recent quarter, while subdued, put spotlight on emerging macro trends posing challenges to earning growth for corporates andd non-corporates taxpayers for the financial year. Also, as many elements of current geopolitical scenario play out over next few months, impact of the developments would come to bear on the forecast for rest of year too,"" said Sumit Singhania, a partner at Deloitte India.","Gross direct tax collections rose less than 5% to Rs 5,45,207 crore during the fiscal year up to June 19.

Karnataka had earlier submitted a formal proposal to the Centre, citing a price crash in both tomatoes and mangoes, particularly the Totapuri variety.However, Swamy informed the Centre that tomato prices had stabilised since the proposal was submitted, and thus, no immediate intervention was needed for tomatoes.“Since farmers were receiving much lower-than-usual prices for Totapuri mangoes, it was decided that the difference in price from the usual market rate would be borne equally by the Centre and state governments,” the ministry said.Swamy thanked Chouhan for approving the move. “This decision will support and provide relief to mango-producing farmers in the state,” he said.","The decision was taken during a video conference between Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Karnataka Agriculture Minister N Chaluvaraya Swamy.

India’s Rare Earth Requirements

India is readying a plan to reduce its acute dependence on China for rare earth minerals. The move comes at a time when China has imposed export curbs on rare earths and Indian industry has raised alarm bells on shortage of magnets and other components.India is looking at a Rs 3,500-Rs 5,000 crore scheme to promote the production of rare earth minerals and derived magnets domestically, with approval expected within two weeks, according to a senior government official. ""The priority is to start domestic-critical mineral production in the shortest time period,"" the official told ET.China dominates global supply of rare earth magnets and has implemented export restrictions. These essential minerals, vital for manufacturing automobiles, electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy infrastructure, face supply constraints.The incentives in India’s proposed programme will be distributed through a reverse bidding mechanism. This initiative follows an internal ministerial assessment that highlighted the necessity to diversify supply sources, given the substantial reliance on imports from China.Also Read | India bleeds Pakistan dry: Water at ‘dead’ levels in Pakistan's dams; bigger Indus river plans in the works - top points to know ""Fresh steps are being taken to boost domestic availability of critical minerals,"" the official said, noting that a minimum of five major Indian companies have informally shown interest in manufacturing these materials during discussions with government authorities.The automotive sector has highlighted concerns about Chinese restrictions and requested governmental assistance. In April, Beijing introduced mandatory special export licences for seven rare earth elements and associated magnets.In India, manufacturers of EVs and wind turbines represent the primary consumers of rare earth elements, accounting for more than 50% of the projected domestic demand of 4010 metric tonnes in 2025. The overall requirement is anticipated to reach 8220 metric tonnes by 2030.Also Read | ‘Dramatic decline…watch out…’: China’s exports to US dip sharply amid Trump trade war; why India needs to be on the guard Additionally, the government intends to modify the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act to bolster the critical mineral initiative.

According to the company, the experts expressed agreement with the steps taken and affirmed the effectiveness of ONGC’s approach.While ONGC did not specify a timeline for bringing the well completely under control, it said site preparations were underway for the next phase of operations, which include removal of tubulars from the well and mobilisation of cranes to assist in clearing the rig floor.As part of safety measures, 24x7 water blanketing continues, and flood-level monitoring of the nearby Dikhow River is in progress to ensure environmental compliance.“ONGC is continuously monitoring the low explosive limit (LEL) levels of air around the well site through real-time gas detectors to ensure safety. Medical assistance is being provided at the relief camp to support all those in need,” the statement added.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, in a LinkedIn post on Friday, said he was closely monitoring the operations. “The Crisis Management Team headed by experienced blowout control specialists are on the job,” he wrote.He confirmed that nearby residents had been relocated to a relief camp, with food, security, and essential supplies arranged by local authorities. Water blanketing was being used as a key precaution to prevent fire, he said.Puri also noted that the composition of gas — mostly methane (97%) — was dispersing upward and not accumulating at ground level, thereby limiting the hazard.“Air quality monitoring shows levels are within safe limits even at a 50-100 metre radius from the well,” the minister added.The wellhead pressure has dropped significantly — from 2,600 psi to 500 psi — a sign of falling gas intensity. “We are trying to contain the situation through junk shot operation and will try pumping kill fluids today. If this does not suffice, capping of the well shall also be considered,” Puri said.","State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ( ONGC ) on Saturday said it had made significant progress in its efforts to contain the gas blowout.

According to Kumar, the regulatory overhaul is part of a broader roadmap aimed at deepening India’s securities market, with mutual funds playing a “critical pillar” in promoting inclusive financial growth.Kumar said the reforms are in line with Sebi’s “optimum regulation” approach, which balances the interests of regulators, investors, and the industry.India’s mutual fund industry has crossed Rs 72 lakh crore in assets under management (AUM), and monthly SIP contributions have touched Rs 28,000 crore. However, only about five crore people invest in mutual funds in a country of 140 crore, he pointed out.Sebi is also reviewing scheme categorisation rules to ensure funds remain “true to label” and are easier for investors to understand, helping prevent mis-selling.A new product category, Strategic Investment Fund (SIF), aimed at investors with ticket sizes between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, has been approved and will be managed by mutual funds.Kumar said Sebi is also simplifying processes for Portfolio Management Services (PMS) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), which will offer similar investor options.Addressing concerns about stress-test disclosures for mid- and small-cap funds, Kumar reiterated Sebi’s disclosure-based regulatory approach. “Informed investors are central to market resilience,” he said, adding that Sebi is open to streamlining compliance.“Our goal is not to disrupt but to allow business to thrive,” Kumar said.On regional expansion, Kumar emphasised the potential in eastern India and the Northeast, calling them strategic regions for deepening mutual fund penetration.AMFI CEO V N Chalasani, also speaking at the summit, said India is evolving from financial inclusion to financial well-being. However, mutual fund AUM still makes up only 20% of India’s GDP, compared to a global average of 65%, he said.He called for greater financial literacy in Tier 3 and Tier 4 towns and cited new AMFI initiatives including school programmes, India Post tie-ups, and product innovation to reach mid-income investors.“Every Indian can evolve from a saver to an investor and ultimately a wealth creator,” Chalasani said.",Sebi is working on a comprehensive review of mutual fund regulations to make them more investor-centric and industry-friendly.

Agriculture self-reliance: Govt says oilseeds and pulses output growing faster; MPs raise alarm over costly edible oil imports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/agriculture-self-reliance-govt-says-oilseeds-and-pulses-output-growing-faster-mps-raise-alarm-over-costly-edible-oil-imports/articleshow/121992839.cms,"AI image

The government has told a parliamentary committee that domestic production of pulses and edible oils has risen at a greater pace in the last 10 years compared to the previous decade, even as several MPs voiced concern over the country’s continued dependence on imports to meet demand.In a presentation to the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Food Processing, the agriculture ministry said imports accounted for 15.66 million metric tonnes (MMT), or 56 per cent, of the total domestic demand for edible oils in 2023-24.Sources said the ministry, during the committee meeting held on June 20, emphasised the ongoing efforts to achieve self-sufficiency, PTI reported. It noted that oilseeds production rose by 55 per cent between 2014-15 and 2024-25, with the third advance estimate pegging production at 426.09 lakh tonnes in the last fiscal.In contrast, the growth in oilseeds output was only 13 per cent in the 2004-05 to 2014-15 period.MPs also expressed concerns over public health, particularly in connection with India's high dependence on imported palm oil, which is relatively cheaper. Some members flagged possible health hazards associated with palm oil consumption.The ministry said the country's dependence on edible oil imports is costing more than Rs 80,000 crore annually.Based on the data presented for 2023-24, India’s domestic production was adequate to meet the demand for mustard and groundnut oils. However, the country had to import 3.49 MMT of sunflower oil against a domestic consumption of 3.55 MMT and imported more than 60 per cent of its soybean oil needs.On pulses, the ministry said their production rose by 47 per cent between 2014-15 and 2024-25—a period when the BJP-led NDA was in power—compared to a 31 per cent increase in the decade before, under the Congress-led UPA government.Some MPs suggested incentivising farmers who traditionally grow paddy and wheat to shift towards pulses and oilseeds.The ministry also elaborated on the government’s roadmap to achieve 'aatmanirbharta' or self-reliance in pulses and oilseeds by 2030-31. These plans were detailed in the Union Budget earlier this year.Among the challenges flagged by the ministry was that 75 per cent of pulse crops are rainfed and grown on marginal lands with low fertility by small and marginal farmers.The sources added that the presentation also covered the government’s national campaign to promote “optimal utilization of edible oils and its health benefits” in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a 10 per cent reduction in their intake to boost overall fitness.","The agriculture ministry said imports accounted for 15.66 million metric tonnes (MMT), or 56 per cent, of the total domestic demand for edible oils in 2023-24.

Every year, nearing International Yoga Day , I end up thinking more intensely about the power of transformation that lies in something so old, yet so eternally pertinent- Yoga.To me, Yoga originally started out as an exercise routine, a means to stretch and relax in between meetings, commuting, and the seemingly never-ending to-do lists of building and expanding companies. But eventually, it has become so much deeper- a centering force, a daily reboot button, and a gentle push that reminds me to be balanced amidst the craziness of contemporary living.Recently, I spent time in the presence of some spiritual leaders- people who have made their lives a mission about spiritual well-being and group consciousness. Through all their different paths and views, one strand was jarringly consistent: the requirement to integrate Yoga and meditation into every day life- not as an occasional pleasure, but as a requirement. Their messages lingered. And more importantly, so did their energy- calm, clear, centered. It reminded me that amidst ambition and acceleration, what we often forget is the importance of stillness.Yoga, in its purest sense, isn't so much about physical dexterity- it's about mental toughness. Science confirms this. Several studies in scientific journals such as Frontiers in Psychiatry and JAMA Internal Medicine have established that practising yoga and meditation regularly can drastically mitigate stress, even anxiety. For working professionals like myself who tend to work in high-stress environments with decision fatigue, the capacity to mentally reset becomes not only useful, but essential.This year, on the day of International Yoga Day, we are hosting specially curated yoga sessions at all our offices, conducted by trained experts. It's a modest step but a genuine one. I want the entire organisation - the leadership and the newest joiner alike- to feel the benefits of this practice in their own lives. Because I passionately believe that the health of an organisation mirrors the health of its people.We are an age where burnout is a badge of honour, and where being constantly connected tends to disconnect us from ourselves. Yoga presents a lovely counter-narrative. It shows us that slowing down can be the quickest path to clarity, creativity, and compassion.As a leader, I take it upon myself to not only advocate for innovation and growth but also to exemplify care and balance. That involves making wellness non-negotiable, not just in policy, but in practice.So today, as we all unfurl our mats and breathe deep into our bodies, I invite you to stop- not just for a stretch, but for quiet. Not just for strength, but for gentleness. And not just for today, but for each day thereafter.For when we honour the mind, the body will follow. And when we guide from that space of harmony, everything else takes care of itself.Happy International Yoga Day- and remember, the best pose is the one where you’re kind to yourself. And a gentle nudge to hydrate.","Aishwarya Bansal, Co-founder, Smartworld Developers is celebrating International Yoga Day.

DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: Manoj Sharma doesn't fly by the book in the Kedarnath sector — he flies by sight, by wind, by instinct. ""We are flying in one of the world's most unforgiving regions with very little real-time weather support,"" he said. ""Operations in such large numbers are being conducted on pilot observation and visual reference. The weather is very unpredictable and changes very rapidly.""That reality, long known to those in the cockpit, now has the country's attention. In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents — two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage — all on the Kedar route. In one case, a Kestrel Aviation helicopter crash-landed near a road after a mechanical failure, injuring the pilot and damaging a vehicle.This is not an outlier year. In 2022, an Aryan Aviation chopper crashed near Kedarnath, killing seven. In 2023, Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) finance controller Amit Saini died after being struck by a tail rotor. And in 2013, a military rescue helicopter went down during flood relief, killing 20.The terrain is tough — but it is not the only challenge. The system built to manage it is, in many ways, still catching up to the traffic it supports.Pilgrimage flights have surged over the past decade, but the region lacks a dedicated air traffic control network.""There is no ATC control nor any weather station in these areas,"" said a veteran pilot. ""Flying in the narrow valley from Gaurikund to Kedarnath needs a lot of experience and safety awareness, as there are no landing sites on this stretch that can be used in an emergency or bad weather."" Another pilot added, ""There is no information provided on routes where major helicopter operations take place. Till such time these issues can't be addressed, these operations should immediately be stopped. ""This month, the civil aviation ministry suspended Aryan Aviation from Char Dham operations and grounded two TransBharat pilots who flew in unsuitable weather, suspending their licences for six months.UCADA — established by the state in 2013 to oversee civil aviation development and safety, including helipad infrastructure and coordination with private operators — has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review with all operators and setting up a command-and-control room to monitor real-time risks. DGCA has deployed officers to oversee safety, airworthiness and the functioning of the control centre.But many in the sector say these moves fall short. ""It seems there are no checks and balances in place,"" said one chopper operator. ""There is someone who replaced one inoperative part on a chopper with another inoperative part from another chopper to show that the part has been changed. Because of unscrupulous operators, conscientious operators and passengers are suffering.""Others point to a deeper culture of pressure and compromise. ""There have been five chopper crashes in the country within the last 1.5 months, which is the worst we have ever seen in helicopter operations in our country,"" said a senior pilot. ""Char Dham operations are one of the toughest... yet we still fly as if nothing needs fixing.""Another pilot was more direct: ""We need a complete stop on chopper operations for this yatra season. All stakeholders — owners, pilots, commercial, engineers, DGCA and UCADA — need to look within and change."" One added, simply, ""It's greed. That's what's driving this. Not safety.""","In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents. Two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has introduced a 30.5 trillion won (USD 22.1 billion) supplementary budget plan aimed at revitalising the country’s weakening economy and supporting struggling citizens, reported news agency ANI, citing The Korea Herald.The proposal, which received Cabinet approval on Thursday, includes 20.2 trillion won in new spending and a downward revision of 10.3 trillion won in revenue projections, South Korea’s first such adjustment in five years.“Fiscal soundness and adherence to balanced budgeting are important, but the current downturn is too severe for the government to stand by,” Lee said at a Cabinet meeting, according to The Korea Herald. “It is time to put public finances to use.”President Lee emphasised two key priorities: stimulating economic growth and ensuring equitable distribution of benefits. Central to the stimulus is a universal cash handout scheme worth 10.3 trillion won, disbursed via spending coupons.All citizens will initially receive a minimum of 150,000 won, while lower-income households will get more. A second round of payments will exclude the top 10 per cent of earners, with the remaining 90 per cent receiving an additional 100,000 won.As per news agency Reuters, this marks the second supplementary budget of the year, coming just weeks after Lee's June 3 election victory. His expansionary fiscal approach aims to counter sluggish domestic demand, compounded by external shocks including US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes and internal political turmoil.The budget includes 2.7 trillion won for the beleaguered construction sector, which has seen four consecutive quarters of contraction.An additional 1.2 trillion won is earmarked for future-oriented industries, such as AI and renewable energy, while 5 trillion won is set aside for livelihood support. This includes 1.4 trillion won for distressed borrower debt relief and 1.6 trillion won to boost job-seeking aid and delayed wage support for vulnerable workers.The revenue forecast has been cut to 642.4 trillion won, down from 651.6 trillion won. Total government expenditure for 2025 has been revised upwards from 673.3 trillion won to 702 trillion won.The resulting integrated fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 110.4 trillion won, or 4.2 per cent of GDP, up from last year’s 3.3 per cent, with national debt forecast to exceed 1,300 trillion won, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 49 per cent.The government plans to fund the package with 19.8 trillion won in treasury bond issuances and an additional 10 trillion won from budget restructuring and reserves.Despite the expanding deficit, the finance ministry said Korea’s fiscal stance remains sustainable by global standards. The supplementary budget is projected to boost GDP growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points.The Bank of Korea currently projects 0.8 per cent growth, while the IMF expects a 1 per cent rise.","South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has introduced a 30.5 trillion won (USD 22.1 billion) supplementary budget plan.

‘Maybe I’ll change my mind about firing him’: Trump revives threat to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell; calls him ‘total and complete moron’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/maybe-ill-change-my-mind-about-firing-him-trump-revives-threat-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell-calls-him-total-and-complete-moron/articleshow/121991162.cms,"Donald Trump revives threat to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump on Friday again floated the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, reigniting a long-standing feud over interest rates he claims should be much lower.In a scathing post on Truth Social, Trump called Powell a “numbskull” and a “total and complete moron,” blaming him for refusing to reduce rates despite what Trump called “virtually no inflation” in the economy.“I don’t know why the Board doesn’t override this Total and Complete Moron! Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him?” Trump wrote. “But regardless, his Term ends shortly,” Trump added.Powell’s current term ends in May 2026.Trump’s renewed criticism came just days after the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50%. Powell, backed by all six board members and five regional bank presidents, cited the need for patience as inflation trends slowly downward.Trump, however, insists rates should be slashed to between 1% and 2%, claiming such a move could save the country up to $1 trillion annually.“I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice, I’ve been neutral, and I’ve been nasty, and nice and neutral didn’t work!” Trump added.As per The Hill, Powell has previously stated that a sitting US president cannot lawfully remove a Fed chair except for cause, such as misconduct. A recent Supreme Court ruling also reinforced the Fed’s unique structure as a quasi-independent entity, limiting Trump’s ability to dismiss Powell directly.Trump's renewed focus on the Fed comes at a time when Fed Governor Christopher Waller, considered a top contender for Powell’s successor, suggested that rate cuts could be on the table by July, citing cooling inflation and signs of a weakening labour market.Nonetheless, Waller joined the unanimous decision to keep rates on hold this week.Adding to the speculation, Trump is reportedly preparing to announce a nominee to replace Powell, potentially well before the end of his term.Market analysts have warned that such an early move could create instability by introducing a “shadow chair” dynamic, where the sitting chair and the president's nominee pull policy in conflicting directions.Names circulating as potential replacements include Fed Governor Waller, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, former Trump nominee Judy Shelton, and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett. However, any new Fed chair must be confirmed by the US Senate, a process that could take months.Market strategists caution that the perception of a politically influenced appointment could erode confidence in the Fed’s independence. “Any Wall Street manager would tell you that Fed independence is the golden rule of markets,” said Callie Cox of Ritholtz Wealth Management.Despite the firestorm, Powell remains firm. In a previous statement, he said he would not step down if asked and reiterated that Fed decisions are grounded in economic data, not political pressure.Meanwhile, Trump's intensifying rhetoric and tariff plans continue to inject uncertainty into the central bank’s outlook for the second half of 2025.","US President Donald Trump on Friday again floated the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

While President Donald Trump has repeatedly pressed the Fed to cut rates, Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank would act cautiously, waiting to assess the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation and growth.“I think you'd want to start slow,” Waller said. “But start the process, that's the key thing.”Waller argued that central banks should “look through tariff effects on inflation” and instead focus on underlying price trends.Even if the tariffs pushed prices up temporarily, he said, it would likely be a “one-off level effect” that should not result in persistent inflation.His comments highlight a growing divide among Fed policymakers on the path forward. Powell had said Wednesday that while tariff effects could prove temporary, the Fed is “well-positioned to wait to learn more” before considering a shift in policy.Waller also rejected Trump’s recent suggestion that rate cuts could reduce debt-servicing costs. “Our mandate from Congress tells us to worry about unemployment and price stability, and that's what we're doing,” he said, adding, “It does not tell us to provide cheap financing to the US government.”","Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said the central bank could start cutting interest rates as soon as next month.

Asian equity markets closed on a mixed note Friday while crude oil prices climbed amid mounting geopolitical tension in the Middle East and uncertainty over whether the US will join Israel in its escalating war with Iran.US benchmark crude rose 15 cents to $73.65 a barrel and Brent, the global benchmark, was up 19 cents at $76.89. Investors are on edge over the threat of supply disruptions through the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil chokepoint near Iran, and the impact of war on global markets.The latest escalation followed comments from the White House, which said President Donald Trump could decide within two weeks whether to initiate military action against Iran, though diplomacy remains on the table.“Risk sentiments were cautious as Iran-Israel tensions continued roiling,” said Mizuho Bank Ltd. in a morning note.Asian bourses were split: Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 1.2% to 23,504.59, while Shanghai’s Composite recovered to close 0.1% higher at 3,364.83 after early weakness.

Fear looms: Will Donald Trump name US Fed chair Powell’s successor soon? Here’s why markets are wary of ‘shadow chair’ signal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fear-looms-will-donald-trump-name-us-fed-chair-powells-successor-soon-heres-why-markets-are-wary-of-shadow-chair-signal/articleshow/121972446.cms,"AI image

US President Donald Trump has said he will soon announce a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, nearly a year before Powell’s term ends in May 2026 — a move investors warn could destabilise markets if it raises questions about Fed independence.Trump, who reappointed Powell in 2018, has repeatedly criticised the central bank for not cutting interest rates this year. Though he has stepped back from earlier threats to fire Powell, Trump told Reuters this month that a decision on the next Fed chair was coming “soon”.According to a Reuters report, markets are concerned that any premature nomination could create a “shadow chair” dynamic, where two conflicting voices steer monetary policy. “You’re going to have two people trying to steer the ship: One that’s actually steering it, and one that’s the backseat driver,” said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.The central bank’s policy-setting committee has 18 members, but the chair is viewed as its most powerful voice. “Whomever is appointed, the key thing to monitor is whether they are perceived as being a political appointee,” said Eric Winograd, chief US economist at AllianceBernstein.“And by that, I mean someone whose views change with the whims of the president.”Prediction markets have listed names such as White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Judy Shelton, a former Trump nominee, as top contenders. Fed Governor Christopher Waller also ranks high on Kalshi, another online market.The White House and Fed declined to comment. Shelton pointed to her Wall Street Journal op-ed on the Fed, while Warsh did not respond.Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said, “Any Wall Street manager would tell you that Fed independence is the golden rule of markets. To move away from that can introduce a whole host of issues.”Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, added, “It’s a risk that exists if people are too complacent on how this could all play out.”Powell’s leadership has faced persistent criticism from Trump, who called him a “numbskull” last week over the Fed’s refusal to cut rates again this year. The Fed’s policy rate remains at 4.25%–4.5%, with the last cut of 25 basis points taking place in December 2024.Any new chair must be confirmed by the US Senate, a process that could take months. Alex Grassino, global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management, said the markets would closely monitor any announcement: “You’re sort of setting up an alternate version of what you think policy should be.”“The optimal market reaction to any Fed chair nomination may be none at all,” added Felix Vezina-Poirier, strategist at BCA Research. “No reaction, or a decrease in long-term yields, would be a good sign that the market is digesting the Fed candidate.”Still, some investors believe Trump may wait until Powell’s term nears its end before naming a replacement. “If I were betting, I’d bet other,” said Winograd. “I’d bet the field.”","US President Donald Trump has said he will soon announce a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Rare Earth crisis deepens: China’s shipments sink to five-year low; down 74% YoY in May,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rare-earth-crisis-deepens-chinas-shipments-sink-to-five-year-low-down-74-yoy-in-may/articleshow/121969503.cms,"AI image

China's overseas shipments of rare earth magnets fell sharply in May, dropping to their lowest level in more than five years as export restrictions and heightened customs scrutiny disrupted global supply chains.According to data from the General Administration of Customs, China exported just 1,238 metric tons of rare earth permanent magnets last month, a 52.9% drop from April and the weakest monthly figure since February 2020. Compared to May 2024, shipments were down 74% year-on-year.April’s exports had already halved from March, marking a sustained downward trend that has unsettled industries worldwide, including automotive, aerospace, semiconductors, and military equipment manufacturing, reported Reuters.China, which produces more than 90% of the world’s rare earth magnets, began enforcing restrictions in early April on the export of seven types of medium-to-heavy rare earth products and certain magnets. While the move was intended to assert control over strategic resources, it has created confusion at customs, especially since a single customs code covers a wide range of magnet chemistries.Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that Chinese customs officials have become increasingly cautious in processing rare earth shipments, particularly those used in appliances and consumer electronics.They added that officials are unsure how to interpret and apply Beijing’s export control rules.China’s ministry of commerce announced Thursday that “a certain number” of export license applications had been approved, though no details were provided. Meanwhile, Chinese producers such as JL MAG Rare-Earth and Innuovo Technology have confirmed recently that they secured limited export licenses for some clients.Despite efforts to ease bottlenecks, overall exports of rare earth magnets for the January-May period stood at 19,132 metric tons, down 14.5% from the same period in 2024, the lowest five-month total since 2021.Earlier this month, Beijing agreed to expedite the export approval process as part of a broader effort to de-escalate trade tensions with the US. However, industry insiders say customs delays and regulatory ambiguity continue to hinder shipments.","China exported just 1,238 metric tons of rare earth permanent magnets last month, a 52.9% drop from April.

Ever since US President Donald Trump took office, five months ago, his economic policies have unleashed widespread volatility across global financial markets, triggering investor pullback, a weakening dollar, and a sharp divergence in global stock performance.Here is a look at the financial roller-coaster rise:After years of dominating global markets, US stocks are now lagging behind — with Europe reaping the gains.Since the start of the year, Wall Street’s S&P 500 index has risen just two percent, while Frankfurt’s main index has surged 16 percent. London and Paris have also outperformed, recording gains of eight and three percent respectively.Kevin Thozet of investment firm Carmignac attributed the underperformance to President Trump’s inconsistent stance on tariffs.Thozet told AFP that the president’s shifting stance on tariffs had fuelled significant uncertainty around how they might affect economic growth.The US dollar has shed 10 percent of its value against the euro over the past six months, its steepest decline in three decades, according to Robert Farago, analyst at British investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.While President Trump’s tariff policies are seen as the primary driver, mounting concerns over the ballooning US debt, amplified by a costly presidential budget proposal, have further weighed on the currency.Though some have floated the idea of the Chinese yuan as a possible alternative to the dollar, ECB President Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the euro’s potential for a stronger international role.Still, significant hurdles remain for any currency seeking to challenge the dollar’s dominance.American debt has long been seen as a bedrock of the global financial system, with investors worldwide turning to US Treasury bonds as a safe haven.But that confidence is starting to crack. JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon recently warned that the ballooning US debt is a ""real problem"" and that bond markets are entering a ""tough time.""At the end of May, yields on 30-year US Treasury bonds crossed the key five percent threshold—an indication of waning faith in America's ability to manage its debt.""I've always told clients they need US debt if they want an asset that remains intact even in a disaster, but I think that's no longer the case,"" said Alexandre Hezez, strategist at Banque Richelieu.Adding to the concern, Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers noted that the dollar is weakening even as interest rates rise, ""a sign that money is leaving the US.""Donald Trump made lowering oil prices a key priority in his efforts to curb US inflation.In April, crude prices dipped below $60 a barrel, their lowest level since 2021. However, this drop was driven less by policy success and more by market fears. Investors, rattled by Trump’s tariff moves, anticipated a global economic slowdown that would weaken demand.More recently, rising tensions in the Middle East have pushed prices back up. The military escalation between Israel and Iran has driven oil back to around $75 a barrel.Gold has traditionally been seen as the ultimate safe haven during times of uncertainty and 2025 has been no different. Soaring demand has pushed its value up by nearly 30 percent since the start of the year.Much of this rally has been fuelled by major central banks, which are increasingly turning to gold over the US dollar to shore up their reserves.At the same time, Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind cryptocurrencies. Alongside his personal investments, his administration has introduced measures to integrate digital assets more firmly into the financial system.Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark for the first time shortly after the US election, capping off a nearly 60 percent gain over the past year.","Since the start of the year, Wall Street’s S&P 500 index has risen just two percent, while Frankfurt’S main index has surged 16 percent.

Global FDI decline: UN warns of declining globalisation; 'Barriers are rising',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-fdi-decline-un-warns-of-declining-globalisation-barriers-are-rising/articleshow/121958419.cms,"FDI

United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Thursday expressed concern over the declining state of globalisation, warning that foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to shrink amid worsening global economic conditions.His remarks came as the UN released fresh data highlighting a negative outlook for international investment flows.In its 2025 World Investment Report, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) revealed that global FDI dropped by 11 per cent last year, once adjusted for volatile financial flows through several European economies, falling to $1.5 trillion. The downturn follows two consecutive years of decline and is expected to continue into 2025, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions and tariff disputes.“At a time when the world should be deepening cooperation and expanding opportunity, we are seeing the opposite,” Guterres said.“Barriers are rising. Globalisation is retreating. And the consequences for sustainable development are profound. Rising trade tensions, policy uncertainty and geopolitical divisions risk making the investment environment even worse.,” he further added.UNCTAD attributed the global slide to a 22 per cent fall in FDI to developed economies, with Europe taking the hardest hit, recording a staggering 58 per cent decline.The United States, however, saw a 23 per cent increase, helping North America stand out as an exception.In contrast, FDI inflows to developing countries remained relatively stable, though the broader investment outlook remains fragile.Presenting the findings at a press conference, UNCTAD secretary-general Rebeca Grynspan called the situation “clear and urgent,” warning that global investment remains “weak” and the prospects for this year are “negative.”“The investment landscape in 2024 was shaped by international tensions, trade fragmentation, and intensifying industrial policy competition,” she said. These factors are “eroding long-term investor confidence.”Although trade showed early signs of recovery in 2023 after the pandemic years, Grynspan said that renewed uncertainty—particularly stemming from the renewed trade war initiated by former US President Donald Trump in April—has “killed that possibility for 2025.”“The problem that we have is that we don't see an end,” she added.The findings come at a time when global economic cooperation appears increasingly strained, with the ripple effects of protectionist policies threatening to undermine progress toward sustainable development goals.","Global FDI dropped by 11 per cent last year, once adjusted for volatile financial flows through several European economies.

US President Donald Trump once again slammed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, accusing him of costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars after the central bank kept the interest rates unchanged. ""Too Late,"" Trump tweeted, calling Powell one of the ""dumbest"" and most ""destructive"" people in government.""Too Late"" Jerome Powell is costing our Country hundreds of billions of dollars. He is truly one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government, and the Fed Board is complicit,"" Trump posted on Truth social.Trump expressed frustration after the Fed chose to keep interest rates unchanged, despite European countries implementing multiple rate cuts. He argued that the US should have already reduced rates by 2.5 points to save billions on short-term debt, highlighting the country’s low inflation as justification for the cuts.""Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had none. We should be 2.5 Points lower, and save $BILLIONS on all of Biden’s Short Term Debt. We have LOW inflation! TOO LATE’s an American Disgrace!"" Trump noted.He had earlier called Powell a “real dummy” and claimed he was ""costing America billions.""Trump also shared an article in which an investor argued Powell should resign immediately if he failed to cut short-term interest rates, saying the Fed’s slow actions were hurting the housing market and that inflation had dropped enough to justify a rate cut.The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting, sticking with a range between 4.25% and 4.50%.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was in no rush to act and would monitor inflation trends and the impact of Trump's new tariffs over the summer. “We'll make smarter and better decisions if we just wait a couple of months,” Powell said, suggesting a cautious stance given the mixed economic signals.The Fed also revised its outlook—cutting its 2025 growth forecast from 1.7% to 1.4%, and raising inflation expectations to 3% and the unemployment rate to 4.5%.From “stupid” to “worst ever.”Trump's criticism of Powell is not new. In the past, Trump has publicly attacked the Fed chairman, including calling him “stupid” just before the rates were announced.Trump has suggested that cutting rates will lower the interest America pays on its debt—an argument critics say overlooks the inflationary risks of such moves.The Fed noted that Trump’s sweeping 10% tariffs on major trading partners were likely to increase inflation and slow growth.Powell added that the full effects were still unclear and may not be visible for several months. ""Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,"" he said.",The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting.

Global oil supply: Iran may use threat of closing Strait of Hormuz as leverage only; analysts say markets remain in surplus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-oil-supply-iran-may-use-threat-of-closing-strait-of-hormuz-as-leverage-only-analysts-say-markets-remain-in-surplus/articleshow/121957332.cms,"Representative image

Iran has repeatedly warned of blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow yet strategically crucial maritime chokepoint for global oil supply, however, the country has not yet shut it down.Analysts say that the vital passage has never been shut down and Iran is using this threat as a diplomatic lever and that the chances of an actual shutdown are slim. Additionally, global oil markets are also well prepared to absorb any geopolitical shock from the region.""Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz numerous times in the past but has never followed through, as doing so would be strategically and economically self-defeating,"" said Hitesh Jain, strategist for institutional equities research at Yes Securities.The Strait, which lies between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula, is the main passage for oil exports from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. It also serves as a key route for liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments from Qatar. Roughly 20% or one fifth of global oil and a significant share of global LNG passes through this narrow waterway. Over a third of India’s energy needs also travel through the passage.Jain noted that oil markets remain well-supplied, pointing to OPEC’s spare capacity of 4 million barrels per day and a pre-conflict global surplus of 0.9 million bpd as key buffers.The growing strength of US shale production, he added, further boosted the market’s resilience.Rating agency ICRA echoed the sentiment but added a note of caution, suggesting that crude prices may average to $70-80 per barrel for the current fiscal year.“A sustained flare-up in the conflict poses upside risks for our estimates of crude oil prices, and consequently of net oil imports and the current account deficit (CAD). A $10 per barrel increase in the average price of crude oil for the fiscal will typically push up net oil imports by $13-14 billion during the year, enlarging the CAD by 0.3 per cent of GDP.”India is heavily reliant on imported energy, with over 85% of its crude oil and around half of its natural gas needs coming from abroad, PTI reported.Imports from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, most of which pass through the Strait, account for 40–45% of India’s oil supply. Roughly 60% of its LNG imports also transit through the same channel.Jain added that the global energy landscape has evolved significantly. Since 2008, the rise of US shale has enhanced global supply and flexibility, allowing markets to absorb geopolitical shocks with only short-lived price spikes. Meanwhile, OPEC’s reduced market share and increased spare capacity, largely from Saudi Arabia and the UAE—have helped keep volatility in check.On the demand side, China’s weak post-COVID recovery and the global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), improved fuel efficiency, and greener policies are slowing oil demand in OECD countries. “Given this backdrop, Brent crude is unlikely to sustain levels above $80 per barrel in a durable way unless the Strait of Hormuz is closed, or critical Gulf infrastructure is targeted,” Jain noted.The International Energy Agency (IEA) and US Energy Information Administration (EIA) have both trimmed their 2025 global oil demand growth forecastsby 0.2-0.28 million barrels per day.Still, ICRA cautioned that regional risks remain. Iran currently produces about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil per day, of which 1.8–2.0 million bpd is exported. “While Iranian oil and gas facilities have reportedly been attacked, the extent of damage is not clear. However, any disruption of Iranian production and supplies or a wider regional conflict impacting other large producers in the region could push energy prices higher. ”“At these elevated crude oil prices, while the profitability of upstream players will remain healthy and their capex plans will remain intact, the marketing margins of downstream players will be impacted along with the expansion of LPG under-recoveries” the rating agency added.","Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz numerous times in the past but has never followed through.

The firm suggested the hackers had “effectively burned the funds in order to send Nobitex a political message,” rather than profiting from the theft.The group also accused Nobitex of helping Iran’s government circumvent Western sanctions and funnel money to militant groups, including Hamas and Yemen's Houthis. In a statement posted on X, Predatory Sparrow claimed the platform had played a role in supporting Tehran’s nuclear programme and militant proxies.Nobitex appeared to confirm the breach, saying it was investigating “unauthorised access” to its systems. Its website and app remained offline on Tuesday.Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, described the hack as “particularly significant given the comparatively modest size of Iran’s cryptocurrency market.”The cyberattack follows a fresh wave of escalations between Israel and Iran, sparked last week when Israeli forces reportedly struck nuclear and military targets in Iran, triggering retaliatory missile attacks. The hack also came just days after Predatory Sparrow claimed to have wiped data from Bank Sepah, a major Iranian state-run lender.Elliptic further alleged that associates of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had ties to the Nobitex platform, and that sanctioned Revolutionary Guard operatives used it for financial transactions.While Israeli outlets have repeatedly linked Predatory Sparrow to Israel’s intelligence services, the Israeli government has never officially acknowledged any connection.Last year, US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King voiced concerns over Iran’s use of cryptocurrencies as a tool to bypass international sanctions.","Hackers with suspected links to Israel have stolen over $90 million from Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

NEW DELHI: Russia’s economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov made a rare admission on Thursday, warning that the country’s economy is “on the brink of going into a recession”, even as top Kremlin officials attempted to project calm at the nation’s most prominent economic summit, according to Russian media reports.Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, a high-profile event intended to showcase Russia’s economic strength and attract global investors, Reshetnikov cautioned that current data signals a worrying slowdown.“The numbers indicate cooling, but all our numbers are (like) a rearview mirror,” Reshetnikov was quoted as saying by Russian business outlet RBC. “Judging by the way businesses currently feel and the indicators, we are already, it seems to me, on the brink of going into a recession.”The comments come amid mounting pressure on Russia’s war-fueled economy, which has defied earlier predictions of collapse under Western sanctions. High military spending has kept growth alive and unemployment low, even as inflation surges. Wage hikes and recruitment bonuses for soldiers, along with death payouts, have injected cash into poorer regions, keeping demand steady.Still, economists warn that Russia’s militarized economy is dangerously unbalanced.With foreign investment drying up and growth largely confined to defense sectors, the risk of long-term stagnation looms large.Reshetnikov was blunt: “Going forward, it all depends on our decisions.”But other officials at the forum struck a more optimistic tone. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov admitted the economy was “cooling,” but brushed off concerns by saying, “After any cooling, the summer always comes.” Meanwhile, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina insisted the economy was simply “coming out of overheating.”",Russia’s economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov made a rare admission on Thursday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

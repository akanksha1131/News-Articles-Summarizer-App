Tariff pressures still loom over summer outlook after softening US inflation in April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariff-pressures-still-loom-over-summer-outlook-after-softening-us-inflation-in-april/articleshow/121519332.cms,"The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge eased more than expected in April, offering a temporary reprieve from price pressures even as new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump began to take effect.According to data released Friday by the Commerce Department, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.1% year-over-year, down from a revised 2.3% in March. The figure came in slightly below the 2.2% median forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, keeping overall inflation just above the Fed’s 2% long-term target, AFP reported.On a monthly basis, headline inflation edged up 0.1%, mirroring the increase in the “core” PCE index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Core inflation rose 2.5% from a year earlier, just under the 2.6% economists had projected.“We're seeing evidence that we were on track for a perfect landing when it comes to inflation,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, speaking to AFP. “But that unfortunately came before the tariff storm that is likely to lead to an inflationary acceleration over the course of the summer.”The April price gains were largely driven by a 0.5% increase in prices for durable goods and energy, which was partially offset by a 0.3% decline in food prices.Trump’s newly imposed tariffs, dubbed “liberation day” duties, took effect on April 2, with a 10% levy applied to most countries and even higher rates imposed on key trading partners shortly thereafter. Though some of the measures have since been paused, legal battles are ongoing.This week, the US Court of International Trade ruled Trump exceeded his legal authority, only for a federal judge to grant a temporary stay, allowing the tariffs to remain in place during the appeal.While it's too early for these tariffs to be fully reflected in the data, Daco noted early signs of upward pressure, pointing out that furniture prices began climbing in April following the new duties. “That bodes poorly for the inflation outlook over the coming months,” he warned, suggesting that rising prices could begin to erode consumer spending.The Trump administration maintains that the tariffs will help reduce trade imbalances and won’t harm the broader economy, though many economists expect higher consumer prices and a slowdown in growth — at least in the short term.In more positive economic news, personal income rose 0.8% in April, significantly ahead of the 0.3% forecast. Additionally, the personal saving rate jumped to 4.9% from a revised 4.3% in March, indicating that consumers are holding onto more of their disposable income.For the Federal Reserve, Friday’s data may offer temporary relief. The central bank has kept interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, and officials continue to deliberate over the timing of future rate cuts.Still, the outlook remains uncertain. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, cautioned that the current cooling in inflation may not last. “Inflation will likely reaccelerate for the remainder of 2025 as both supply and demand pressures will push annual inflation rates higher,” he wrote in a note shared with AFP.","In April, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.1% year-over-year, down from a revised 2.3% in March.

"SEBI bans actor Arshad Warsi, wife & 57 others from securities markets for up to 5 years in Sadhna Broadcast case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-bans-actor-arshad-warsi-wife-57-others-from-securities-markets-for-up-to-5-years-in-sadhna-broadcast-case/articleshow/121508805.cms,"Sebi has imposed monetary penalties of Rs 5 lakh each on Warsi and Goretti.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has imposed restrictions on actor Arshad Warsi , his spouse Maria Goretti and 57 other individuals from participating in securities markets for periods ranging from one to five years. This action follows their involvement in deceptive YouTube videos that encouraged share purchases of Sadhna Broadcast.The regulatory body has imposed monetary penalties of Rs 5 lakh each on Warsi and Goretti, alongside a one-year securities market prohibition, according to Sebi's directive issued on Thursday.Additionally, the regulator has imposed financial penalties ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5 crore on 57 other parties, including the promoters of Sadhna Broadcast (presently known as Crystal Business System Ltd).The regulatory body has instructed all 59 entities to return collective illegal profits of Rs 58.01 crore, with an additional 12 per cent annual interest, to be paid jointly until the complete settlement from the investigation conclusion.According to Sebi's findings, Arshad accumulated profits of Rs 41.70 lakh, whilst his wife gained Rs 50.35 lakh from these activities.The conclusive order identified Gaurav Gupta, Rakesh Kumar Gupta and Manish Mishra as the primary orchestrators of this scheme.The order also revealed that Subhash Aggarwal, a director of SBL's RTA, served as an intermediary between Manish Mishra and the promoters.These people were the key figures who orchestrated and implemented the deceptive plan, according to Sebi.Additionally, Sebi noted that Peeyush Agarwal and Lokesh Shah allowed their controlled accounts to be utilised for the fraudulent strategies of Manish Mishra and SBL's promoters.As a dealer at Choice and owner of the stockbroker's Delhi franchise respectively, they played crucial roles in enabling extensive manipulation of the scrip.Jatin Shah was instrumental in implementing the scheme, whilst other parties either supported the fraudulent activities or participated for quick profits, as stated in the order.According to the 109-page directive, Sebi indicated that the noticees acted as information intermediaries or helped execute manipulative trades, without trading the scrip through their personal accounts.Sebi explained that the organised scheme was carried out in two coordinated stages. Initially, connected and promoter-associated entities conducted trades amongst themselves to gradually increase the scrip price and create artificial market activity.The small-volume transactions had an outsized effect on pricing, primarily due to limited market liquidity. This enabled the involved parties to elevate the share value whilst deploying minimal trading resources.Subsequently, promotional content was broadcast via various YouTube platforms including 'Moneywise', 'The Advisor', and 'Profit Yatra', which were under Manish Mishra's management, as stated in the directive.These video presentations portrayed SBL as an attractive investment prospect and were strategically released to complement and enhance the orchestrated market activities.","Sebi has imposed restrictions on actor Arshad Warsi, his spouse Maria Goretti and 57 other individuals.

EPFO likely to allow instant PF withdrawals via UPI and ATMs from June 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-likely-to-allow-instant-pf-withdrawals-via-upi-and-atms-from-june-2025/articleshow/121519755.cms,"Instant PF withdrawals under EPFO 3.0

Expanded withdrawal purposes

The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is set to revolutionize the way millions of employees access their provident fund (PF) savings. Starting June 2025, EPF members will be able to instantly withdraw PF funds via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs, according to DD News.This major step is being implemented with the support of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and has already received approval from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The new facility will also allow users to check their PF balance directly on UPI platforms and transfer funds to their bank accounts without delays.Currently, PF withdrawals involve submitting online claims followed by a waiting period for approval from EPFO field offices. This process can take several days or even weeks. However, the upcoming integration with UPI and ATMs is expected to make settlements instantaneous. Members will be allowed to withdraw up to ₹1 lakh instantly—especially helpful in emergencies.“EPFO has made significant improvements in its digital infrastructure by integrating over 120 databases,” said Sumita Dawra, Secretary at the Ministry of Labour and Employment.“These efforts have reduced claim processing time to just three days, with 95 per cent of claims now being processed automatically. Further upgrades are also in progress to make the system even more efficient.”Currently, the EPF scheme allows withdrawals for medical emergencies, housing, education, and marriage, but members must meet specific eligibility criteria and provide proper documentation. With the upcoming changes, the scope of permitted withdrawal reasons will be expanded, giving employees greater financial flexibility for key life events.In another significant development, pensioners under the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995 will be able to access their pensions from any bank branch across India starting January 1, 2025. This means retirees will no longer be restricted to specific banks or branches.Even if a pensioner relocates or changes banks, pension disbursal will continue seamlessly through the Centralised Pension Processing System (CPPS), eliminating the need to transfer Pension Payment Orders (PPO) between offices.","Starting June 2025, EPF members will be able to instantly withdraw PF funds via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs. The new facility will also allow users to check their PF balance directly on UPI platforms and transfer funds to their bank accounts without delays.

NEW DELHI: Industry associations Solvent Extractors’ Association (SEA) and Indian Vegetable Oil Producers’ Association (IVPA) have welcomed the government’s decision to reduce the basic customs duty on crude edible oils to 10 per cent, calling it a timely intervention that supports domestic refiners and discourages imports of finished products.Announced on Friday, the policy reduces the basic customs duty on crude palm, soybean, and sunflower oils from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. The effective import duty now stands at 16.5 per cent, down from 27.5 per cent. In contrast, refined edible oils continue to attract a 32.5 per cent basic duty, with an effective duty of 35.75 per cent.The move follows concerns raised by the industry over rising imports of refined palmolien. Over the past six months, SEA and IVPA had urged the government to widen the duty gap between crude and refined edible oils to protect local refiners.“The government's decision to increase the duty differential from 8.25 per cent to 19.25 per cent is a bold and timely move. It will discourage imports of refined palmolien and shift demand back to crude palm oil, thereby revitalizing the domestic refining sector,” said SEA President Sanjeev Asthana.He added that while overall edible oil import volumes may remain unchanged, domestic prices are likely to fall, benefitting consumers.India, which imports over 50 per cent of its edible oil requirements, brought in 159.6 lakh tonnes worth Rs 1.32 lakh crore during the 2023–24 oil marketing year. Key sourcing countries include Malaysia and Indonesia for palm oil, and Brazil and Argentina for soybean oil.IVPA President Sudhakar Desai expressed appreciation for the government’s acceptance of their recommendation to expand the duty gap, calling the step a boost for domestic manufacturing.SEA Executive Director B V Mehta described the revised duty structure as “a win-win situation for vegetable oil refiners and consumers, as local prices will go down due to lower duty on crude oils.”Previously, the narrow 8.25 per cent duty gap between crude palm oil (CPO) and refined palmolien had incentivised finished product imports. Refined palmolien accounted for over 20 per cent of total palm oil imports in 2023–24, rising to nearly 27 per cent in the first half of 2024–25.On May 29, the cost-and-freight (C&F) price of refined, bleached, and deodorised (RBD) palmolien was USD 45 per tonne lower than that of crude palm oil, further skewing trade in favour of refined imports.","Government reduces basic customs duty on crude palm, soybean, and sunflower oils from 20% to 10%.

Higher steel tariffs to dent exports as companies look at other markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/higher-steel-tariffs-to-dent-exports-as-cos-look-at-other-markets/articleshow/121544545.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

NEW DELHI: Doubling of import duty on steel and aluminium by the Trump administration will dent export demand, with companies having to scout for alternative markets.Several US importers have gone slow on fresh orders as costs went up significantly after the imposition of 25 per cent duty, although India was not seen to be worse off, given that the same duty applies to all countries. But if Trump decides to move ahead with his threat, several American firms will have to slow down production as such duties are seen to be unviable and unsustainable. This will also reduce demand for inputs.""The economic impact will be significant. US steel prices are already high, at around $984 per metric tonne - far above European prices at $690 and Chinese prices at $392. The doubling of tariffs is expected to push US prices to about $1,180, squeezing US domestic industries such as automotive, construction, and manufacturing that depend on steel and aluminium as key inputs. These sectors may face hundreds of dollars in additional material costs per tonne, driving up prices, reducing competitiveness, and risking job losses or inflationary pressures,"" said trade research body GTRI.Fieo chief S C Ralhan said the increase in tariffs would have a significant bearing on India's steel exports, especially in semi-finished and finished categories like stainless steel pipes, structural steel components, and automotive steel parts.These products are part of India's growing engineering exports, and higher duties could erode our price competitiveness in the US market.EEPC India president Pankaj Chadha said, ""It's unfortunate that while bilateral trade talks are going on between India and the US, such unilateral tariff increases have be done. It only makes the work of negotiators more complicated.""Last fiscal, India exported steel and finished products of $6.2 billion to the US and about $0.9 billion of aluminium and its products. The US is among the top destinations for Indian exporters, who have been increasing market share through high-quality production and competitive pricing, Fieo said.","Several US importers have gone slow on fresh orders as costs went up significantly after the imposition of 25 per cent duty.

VIENNA: Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other key OPEC+ members announced on Saturday a huge increase in crude production for July.They will produce an additional 411,000 barrels a day -- the same target set for May and then June -- according to a statement, which is more than three times greater than the group had previously planned.In recent years, the group within OPEC+ that is known as the ""Voluntary Eight"", or V8, had agreed to daily reductions of 2.2 million barrels with the aim of boosting prices.But in early 2025, OPEC+ members decided on the gradual output increase and subsequently began to accelerate the pace.The moves have resulted in oil prices plummeting to around $60 per barrel, the lowest level in four years.OPEC+ ""struck three times: (the output target for) May was a warning, June a confirmation and July a warning shot"", Rystad Energy analyst Jorge Leon told AFP.""The scale of the production increase reflects more than just internal supply dynamics,"" he said.

Government mulls doubling safeguard duty on steel from 12% to 24%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-mulls-doubling-safeguard-duty-on-steel-from-12-to-24/articleshow/121544149.cms,"This is an AI-generated image used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%, amid concerns that Chinese goods may enter the market and hurt Indian steelmakers.""We have received complaints of Chinese players trying to blunt the impact of the safeguard action by circumventing it. We are mulling over various options,"" a senior government official told TOI.In late April, the government had notified a provisional safeguard duty of 12% for 200 days, and a detailed investigation will be required before a higher duty is imposed.With Chinese goods facing levies and other actions in several markets, especially the US, there are widespread fears of trade diversion with India seen as one of the markets where these goods could be dumped or sold at subsidised prices.India, the world's second-largest crude steel producer, was also a net importer of finished steel for the second consecutive year in 2024-25. Imports are estimated to have neared the 10 million tonne mark.Small players have, however, been complaining about the adverse impact of the safeguard action as they have to deal with higher cost due to a price hike by domestic manufacturers after the safeguard action. The government will seek to strike a balance between the two sides, sources said.","The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%.

'Profit by genuine ethical practices creates wealth for nation': FM Nirmala Sitharman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/refer-to-entrepreneurs-in-india-as-wealth-creators-fm-nirmala-sitharman/articleshow/121539749.cms,"Nirmala Sitharman

NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said that the government recognises entrepreneurs as wealth creators whose ethically earned profits contribute to developmental objectives.“Wealth creation in India has never been a taboo in India. We promoted wealth creation. We would want wealth creation. That is why entrepreneurs in India, under Prime Minister Modi, we refer them as wealth creators. They are not thieves,” she said at the National Commemorative Seminar marking 60 years of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya's Integral Humanism Lectures.Pandit Upadhyaya, a key figure in founding the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, played a significant role in the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in April 1980.Sitharaman said ethical profit-making leads to national wealth creation, which in turn supports dignified labour, education, skill development, and overall national progress. ""We would like to have profit created by genuine ethical practices, and that is what is going to create wealth for the nation. And once you have wealth, you give dignity of labor, you provide for education, you provide for skilling, and you lift the tempo and the spirit of the nation,"" she said.Highlighting Upadhyaya’s philosophy, she said planning must focus on uplifting those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder while preserving their dignity.She added that the principles of Integral Humanism have been reflected in policies under both former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and current Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayaas’ aligns with Upadhyaya’s Antyodaya theory,” Sitharaman stated.She further explained that efforts to alleviate poverty, provide employment, and ensure basic necessities help unlock people's productive potential, thereby enhancing the nation's overall production.Sitharaman also noted that national defence was a priority for Upadhyaya. Since 2014, she said, Prime Minister Modi has prioritised Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in defence manufacturing.She referred to Operation Sindoor as an example of this shift, contrasting it with previous governments that, she said, often cited a lack of funds as a reason for limited defence procurement.",Sitharaman said ethical profit-making leads to national wealth creation.

The upcoming hike in US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, announced by President Donald Trump , is set to impact Indian metal exports worth $4.56 billion, according to a new analysis by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).Beginning June 4, the higher duties are expected to raise product costs for Indian manufacturers and exporters in the American market, potentially affecting their competitiveness.“For India, the consequences are direct. In FY2025, India exported $4.56 billion worth of iron, steel, and aluminum products to the US,” said GTRI, as quoted by ANI.The US continues to be a key market for India’s metal sector. In FY2025, exports included $587.5 million worth of iron and steel, $3.1 billion in iron or steel products, and $860 million in aluminium and related items. The GTRI report cautions that increased tariffs on these categories will challenge India’s market share and profitability in the US.Trump on Friday announced plans to raise existing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, citing national security concerns under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The legislation enables the US president to impose trade restrictions if certain imports are found to pose a threat to national security.Read more: Donald Trump announces 50% tariff on steel imports from June 4 to 'secure industry in US' Trump initially invoked this provision in 2018, setting a 25 per cent tariff on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium. These rates were revised in February 2025, with aluminium tariffs raised to 25 per cent.According to GTRI, the latest increase could drive US steel prices above $1,180 per tonne, with ripple effects on key sectors like automotive, construction, and manufacturing.India has filed a notification with the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding the tariff hike and is exploring additional response measures.GTRI also flagged the environmental implications of the US move. “Steel and aluminium manufacturing are significant carbon emitters globally. While other nations invest in environmentally friendly production methods, the US policy lacks environmental considerations,” the think tank noted.“This decision demonstrates the Trump administration's preference for economic nationalism over environmental stewardship,” GTRI said, adding that it raises questions about the US commitment to global climate goals and sustainable industrial development.","The US continues to be a key market for India’s metal sector.

NEW DELHI: Bank branches in metropolitan areas have seen their share in overall credit decline to 58.7 per cent as of March 2025, down from 63.5 per cent five years ago, according to the Reserve Bank of India ’s (RBI) latest report.The central bank attributed this shift to faster credit growth in non-metro regions. “With higher credit growth in rural, semi-urban and urban areas compared to metropolitan area, the share of metropolitan branches in total credit declined to 58.7 per cent in March 2025 from 63.5 per cent five years ago,” the report stated.Despite the drop in credit share, metropolitan branches continued to lead in deposit mobilisation, registering an annual growth of 11.7 per cent in March 2025. In comparison, rural, semi-urban, and urban centres posted growth rates of 10.1 per cent, 8.9 per cent, and 9.3 per cent, respectively.Overall, bank credit growth moderated to 11.1 per cent in FY25, down from 15.3 per cent in FY24. Deposit growth also slowed to 10.6 per cent from 13 per cent during the same period.The report also noted a shift in deposit composition due to rising term deposit rates, with the share of savings deposits dropping to 29.1 per cent from 30.8 per cent a year ago, and from 33 per cent two years ago.Credit growth declined across all categories of banks in FY25. Private sector banks recorded the sharpest drop, with growth falling to 9.5 per cent after maintaining levels above 15 per cent for three consecutive years.Personal loan growth- including housing, education, vehicle, credit card, and consumer durable segments- also slowed markedly to 13.2 per cent. However, this category's share in overall credit reached 31 per cent. Loans for consumer durables and other personal purposes made up roughly one-third of total personal credit. Loans carrying interest rates above 11 per cent accounted for 47.4 per cent of total lending in this segment, down from 50.3 per cent a year earlier.Industrial credit, which forms about one-fourth of total bank lending, grew at 9.4 per cent in FY25, compared to 10.4 per cent in FY24.On the deposit side, women’s share remained stable at 20.7 per cent, while senior citizens continued to hold over one-fifth of total deposits.

India's consumer price inflation has shown a consistent downward trend.The previous fiscal year recorded an average of 4.6%, while April 2025 witnessed a reduction to 3.2%, reaching its lowest point since July 2019.The declining inflation trend has provided the RBI additional flexibility for interest rate adjustments, resulting in a 50 basis points reduction in policy rates. Jefferies anticipates further cuts of 75 basis points through 2025.The ongoing rate reduction phase is increasing the attractiveness of Indian government bonds, particularly when assessed against developed economies such as the United States.According to Jefferies, ""While India 10-year rupee government bond has outperformed the US 10-year Treasury bond by 51% since April 2020 in US dollar terms. Indeed, it is no longer unthinkable that the ten-year Indian government bond yield will trade below the ten-year Treasury bond yield.""The Indian rupee and positive performance of local-currency emerging market bonds globally are contributing to the optimistic outlook. A significant global sovereign bond portfolio monitored by Jefferies shows India's 15-year bond yielding 6.38%, representing the highest single-country allocation at 25%.This demonstrates sustained trust in the Indian bond market during structural transitions away from G7 debt instruments.Jefferies further said that ""these bonds continue to outperform G7 government bonds, which is another sign of regime change from the Bretton Woods era, as is the growing evidence of supply concerns moving the long end of the US Treasury bond market"".The Indian bond market appears favourably positioned to gain from domestic rate reductions and international investment interest in emerging market debt, supported by decreasing inflation and attractive real rates.

Tit-for-tat tariffs: It’s been a bumpy road

So, what went wrong between the US & China this time?

US President Donald Trump claims he was a ‘Nice Guy’ with China - that he helped China out of a ‘devastating’ situation when the world’s second largest economy was in ‘grave economic danger’. But, China ‘violated’ its agreement with the US, Trump has said in his latest social media post on the Truth Social. Trump’s latest salvo against China comes as no surprise for experts, who have come to accept Trump’s ‘flip-flops’ as a reality.Two weeks ago, the US and China announced reaching an agreement for a temporary 90-day reduction in their tariffs, following discussions between senior officials in Geneva. The United States decided to temporarily decrease its additional tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent. In response, Beijing implemented a corresponding reduction, bringing down its additional tariffs from 125 percent to 10 percent.US tariffs continue to be elevated, incorporating a 20 percent duty that the Trump administration recently applied to Chinese products, citing concerns about Beijing's supposed involvement in illegal drug trafficking - an allegation that China has firmly disputed.But things seem to have gone down hill again since then.Trump’s social post reads, “Two weeks ago China was in grave economic danger! The very high Tariffs I set made it virtually impossible for China to TRADE into the United States marketplace which is, by far, number one in the World. We went, in effect, COLD TURKEY with China, and it was devastating for them. Many factories closed and there was, to put it mildly, “civil unrest. ” I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”Trump has always called China the ‘biggest abuser’ on tariffs. On April 2, also called the ‘Liberation Day’ by Trump, the US President announced sweeping tariffs on most major economies, with China getting hit with 34% tariffs (plus 20% existing tariff). China had retaliated strongly by raising its own tariffs and the situation had quickly escalated to a level where Trump eventually imposed 245% reciprocal tariffs on China.Also Read | Big embarrassment! Pakistan’s crypto attempt to 'please' Donald Trump in a soup Trump levied huge tariffs on Chinese imports, responding to Beijing's stringent restrictions on exports of critical minerals, which are vital components in various products from smartphones and electric vehicles to aircraft engines and nuclear submarines.China controls an overwhelming 92% of the world's rare earth processing capabilities and the United States depends on Chinese supplies for approximately 70% of its rare earth compounds and metals. In the past Trump administration officials have said that China is wielding its market supremacy as a strategic tool, necessitating immediate US action.Global markets went into a tailspin following the trade war between the US and China and the 90-day truce between the world’s two largest economies had brought a sense of relief - albeit fragile!Trump's statement lacks details regarding China's specific violations of the Geneva, Switzerland agreement and does not outline his intended response towards Beijing.A US official informed Reuters that China appeared to be delaying the issuance of export licences for rare earth minerals.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that China had not fulfilled its Geneva commitments. He said, ""The Chinese are slow-rolling their compliance, which is completely unacceptable and it has to be addressed.""Greer indicated that China's supply of critical minerals, previously stopped due to Chinese trade countermeasures, had not resumed as stipulated in the Geneva agreement.Earlier, in a Fox News interview, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen had t indicated that negotiations with China regarding trade matters were ""a bit stalled.""Also Read | ‘Overstepped his authority…’: What are the scathing observations made by US trade court in ruling against Donald Trump’s tariffs?

A recent US trade court verdict said that the president exceeded his authority by invoking emergency economic powers to warrant comprehensive tariffs.The court's decision halted the most extensive duties since Trump's return to office, though the ruling remains suspended pending an appeal process.Nevertheless, the verdict maintains the existing tariffs that the Trump administration had established on specific industry imports, including steel and automotive sectors.Also Read | ‘Even if we lose…’: Donald Trump administration readying two-part strategy to impose reciprocal tariffs, says ‘we will do it another way’","US President Donald Trump claims he was a 'Nice Guy' with China - that he helped China out of a ‘devastating’ situation.

Donald Trump announces 50% tariff on steel imports from June 4 to 'secure industry in US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-announces-50-tariff-on-steel-imports-to-secure-industry-in-us/articleshow/121526245.cms,"US President Donald Trump speaks at US Steel Corporation's Mon Valley Works-Irvin plant, Friday, May 30, 2025, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania (AP Photo)

US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is doubling the tariff on steel imports to 50 percent, a big increase that could raise prices for steel, which is used in housing, cars, and other products.""We're going to bring it from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry,"" Trump said.Trump said he had a ""major announcement"" as he spoke at US Steel’s Mon Valley Works–Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, US state of Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, to talk about investments by Japan’s Nippon Steel.""Nobody's going to get around that,"" he added during the speech in front of workers in a state that helped him win the 2016 election.Trump said US Steel will remain an American company under a deal where Japan-based Nippon Steel will invest in the company. Few details about the deal have been shared.""We’re here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,"" Trump said at an event in one of US Steel's warehouses near Pittsburgh. ""You're going to stay an American company, you know that, right?""He said doubling the tariffs on steel imports ""will even further secure the steel industry in the US.""But this large increase could cause prices to rise more.Trump later posted on social media that the higher tariff rate would take effect on June 4.""It is my great honor to raise the Tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday, June 4th. Our steel and aluminum industries are coming back like never before. This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Workers, Trump supporters, local officials, and others gathered in a large warehouse at the Irvin plant to hear Trump speak. American flags hung from the ceiling, and a sign read ""The Golden Age."" Steelworkers wore orange hard hats and work clothes, and large coils of steel made at the plant filled part of the warehouse floor. The steel is used for appliances, doors, and other products.At first, Trump promised to block the Japanese company’s attempt to buy US Steel, but last week he announced a deal for Nippon Steel to have ""partial ownership."" It is not clear if the deal is finalized or how the ownership will be arranged.Trump said he considered a 40 per cent tariff, but industry leaders asked for 50 per cent.""At 25 per cent they can sorta get over that fence,"" Trump said. ""At 50 per cent nobody’s getting over that fence.""On March 12, Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. This led to immediate retaliation from Canada and complaints from the US auto industry. The European Union also responded with tariffs but later removed them.During his speech on Friday, President Donald Trump also spoke about the agreement he approved, allowing Japan’s Nippon Steel to acquire a controlling stake in US Steel.Earlier, during his presidential campaign, Trump had opposed the idea of US Steel being sold to a foreign company. At the time, it was one of the few issues he agreed on with President Joe Biden, who had blocked the deal, calling it a threat to national security.On Friday, however, Trump said he eventually supported the deal after being convinced that Nippon Steel could help preserve US Steel and protect its workers.""US Steel was being sold into foreign hands with no protections for our great steel workers,"" Trump said. ""And I said there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen. I was watching over you.""Trump said that executives from Nippon and US Steel continued to meet with him to discuss the sale, and he kept turning it down until the proposal included better terms. A major reason he accepted the revised deal, he said, was the inclusion of a so-called golden share, which gives the US government a say in how the company operates.""They kept asking me and I kept rejecting them: No way, no way, no way,"" Trump said. ""Every time they came in, the deal got better and better and better for the workers.""""I’m going to be in Washington; I’m gonna be watching over it,"" Trump added.With the increase in steel tariffs and the finalized Nippon deal, Trump said that workers at US Steel now had reasons to feel hopeful. He invited several workers on stage who shared concerns about the decline of the American steel industry and thanked Trump for his actions.""This is going to be a very big day,"" Trump said. ""This is going to be one of the biggest days in your life.""","US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is doubling the tariff on steel imports to 50 percent.

Despite the day’s dip, the market remained on track to close out what could be its best month since November 2023.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 13 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%.Shares of Gap Inc. dragged on the market, plunging 21.1%, even after the retailer reported better-than-expected profit and revenue. The company, which owns Banana Republic and Old Navy, warned that tariffs on imports from China and other nations could add up to $300 million in costs this fiscal year. While Gap has plans to mitigate about half of that impact, the warning spooked investors.Markets have spent much of the week reacting to the latest developments in the White House’s tariff policy. Earlier optimism that Trump’s tariffs might be easing helped fuel a rally, especially after a U.S.court blocked many of the levies on Wednesday. That helped push the S&P 500 toward its first winning month in four and potentially its strongest since late 2023.However, the situation remains uncertain. The White House is appealing the U.S. Court of International Trade’s ruling, keeping many of the tariffs in place for now. Tensions flared again Friday morning after Trump accused China of failing to uphold its end of the tariff pause agreement. “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” he posted on Truth Social.The comments briefly rattled markets, but futures soon stabilized. Many analysts believe Trump may seek alternative legal routes to continue applying tariff pressure.Trump argues that tariffs are essential to revitalizing American manufacturing, even if households and businesses feel short-term pain. The uncertain outlook has already prompted some companies to pull back. American Eagle Outfitters, for example, withdrew its financial forecast for 2025, citing economic ambiguity. Its stock fell 1.4% after it reported a steeper-than-expected quarterly loss.On the upside, Ulta Beauty shares surged 14.8% after reporting strong sales and raising its full-year revenue outlook, despite describing the business climate as “fluid.” Costco also edged higher, climbing 3.7%, after beating earnings expectations.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers rocketed 69% after surprising investors with a quarterly profit, while SharpLink Gaming extended its meteoric rally, rising 19.5% on Friday to bring its weekly gain to 1,308%. The marketing company, which connects consumers to sportsbooks and casino platforms, announced a $425 million plan to invest in Ethereum-based cryptocurrency ventures.Meanwhile, bond markets were calm. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.40% from 4.43%, while the two-year yield held steady at 3.92%, reflecting investor expectations that the Federal Reserve may hold rates steady for a while longer.A separate report from the University of Michigan showed that consumer sentiment improved slightly in May, especially after Trump paused many of his proposed tariffs on China. Still, Americans remain anxious. “Overall, consumers see the outlook for the economy as no worse than last month, but they remained quite worried about the future,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the Survey of Consumers.The Fed has so far held its benchmark borrowing rate steady in 2025 after a round of cuts late last year. Officials have indicated they want more time to assess the inflationary impact of tariffs before making further decisions.Global markets showed mixed movement. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 rose 0.3%, Germany’s DAX climbed 0.8%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 added 0.6%.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2% to 37,965.10 after inflation data from Tokyo showed core prices rising faster than expected, fueling speculation that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates.Australia’s ASX 200 gained 0.3%, while South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.8% ahead of next week’s presidential election. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 1.2% and China’s Shanghai Composite shed 0.5%.The trade court’s ruling applies only to some tariffs, leaving those on steel, aluminum, and automobiles—enacted under a different law—unaffected. On Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit allowed the president to continue collecting the contested tariffs temporarily while the case proceeds.In energy markets, US crude dipped 7 cents to $60.87 per barrel, while Brent crude fell 10 cents to $63.25. In currency trading, the US dollar weakened to 143.68 yen from 144.12 yen, and the euro edged down to $1.1344 from $1.1367.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in morning trading.

A key US inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices, while American incomes jumped.Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1 per cent in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3 per cent in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5 per cent from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.6 per cent. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court.The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared to their target of 2 per cent. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries.Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.","Consumer prices rose just 2.1 per cent in April compared with a year earlier.

Asian stock markets slipped on Friday after a court ruling in the United States that gave president Donald Trump’s tariff policies a temporary reprieve. The stocks had improved the previous day when a lower court had termed them unconstitutional.The Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.4% on Friday, while Shanghai’s Composite Index slipped 0.5%. Sydney and Seoul also fell, though markets in Wellington and Manila showed modest gains. The yen gained strength after inflation data from Tokyo came in higher than expected, increasing the likelihood of an interest rate hike by the central bank in July.The decline in Asian equities comes after Wall Street ended flat, with slight gains across the Dow and other main indexes. Weak US economic data, including a revised GDP contraction in early 2025 and disappointing jobless and housing numbers, added to the cautious mood.The legal tug-of-war over Trump’s tariffs is now expected to reach the Supreme Court. A federal judge had earlier ruled that the administration exceeded its authority in imposing the levies, a judgment Trump called “horrible” and urged to be overturned. ""Backroom 'hustlers' must not be allowed to destroy our nation!,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.A separate ruling by a federal district judge in Washington, DC also declared some of the tariffs unlawful, giving the administration 14 days to file an appeal.Despite the legal blocks, Trump allies insist that the administration will continue pushing its trade agenda. AFP quoted economists like Rodrigo Catril of National Australia Bank, warning that the fight only adds another layer of uncertainty. ""The only thing that looks more certain is more uncertainty, which is set to lead to a further pullback in investment decision and hiring,"" said Cartil.","The Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.4% on Friday.

Security benefits on the Rise

Compensation for CEOs at S&P 500 companies jumped nearly 10% in 2024, as stock prices surged and corporate profits swelled, continuing a trend of widening pay gaps between executives and average employees.According to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar, the typical pay package for S&P 500 CEOs who served at least two full consecutive fiscal years rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7% from the previous year. In contrast, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419 — a 1.7% increase year over year, AP reported.The AP’s annual survey includes data from 344 executives who filed proxy statements between January 1 and April 30.Despite economic concerns such as lingering inflation and elevated interest rates, the stock market soared in 2024. The S&P 500 gained more than 23%, while corporate profits rose over 9%, driving up performance-based compensation. Many companies have shifted CEO pay toward stock-based awards, which are often conditional on future targets like share price increases or improved profitability.“2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,” said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprises, led the list with a $164.5 million pay package. Nearly all of it consisted of stock awards tied to future performance through 2030. Axon, the maker of Tasers and body cameras, posted a record $377 million in net income and saw its shares more than double last year.Other high earners included:Most of these packages were heavily weighted toward stock and options. According to Equilar, the median value of stock awards climbed nearly 15%, while base salaries grew by only 4%.“For CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,"" said Melissa Burek, another partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. ""Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.”Jackie Cook of Morningstar Sustainalytics noted that linking CEO pay to stock performance may reflect shareholder priorities but warned it has “led to a ‘phenomenal rise’ in CEO compensation ‘tracking recent years' market performance,’ which has ‘widened the pay gap within workplaces.’”Some well-known CEOs were excluded from the rankings due to the survey's eligibility criteria. For instance, Starbucks’ Brian Niccol, whose 2024 compensation was valued at $95.8 million, only became CEO in September. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s $49.9 million package was not included as the company filed its proxy after the survey's deadline.Warren Buffett, known for his modest salary, was listed at $405,000—about five times the median worker's pay at Berkshire Hathaway. Tesla’s Elon Musk reported no compensation for 2024, although his 2018 stock package worth up to $56 billion remains under court review.The median CEO earned 192 times what the median worker at their company made. In some industries, the disparity is even more striking. Carnival Corp. reported a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of nearly 1,300:1, and McDonald's was close behind with a 1,000:1 gap.Private-sector wages rose 3.6% in 2024, with the average U.S. worker earning $65,460 annually, or $92,000 including benefits.“With CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,” said Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. ""These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value – they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates. ”The number of women on the list rose to 27, the highest since 2014. Their median compensation was $20 million — a 10.7% rise compared to 9.7% for male CEOs, who earned a median of $16.8 million.Top-earning female CEOs included:“There are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we’re really not moving the needle significantly,” said Christy Glass, a sociology professor at Utah State University. She cited the broader slowdown in corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts.Equilar found companies are increasingly offering security-related perks as part of executive compensation, possibly influenced by incidents such as the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.Among 208 companies reviewed, median spending on executive security rose from $69,180 in 2023 to $94,276 in 2024. Notable increases came from companies like Centene and Intel.","The median CEO earned 192 times what the median worker at their company made.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Asian shares traded mixed on Tuesday following a rally on Wall Street, sparked by US President Donald Trump’s assurances over ties with China.Japan’s Nikkei slipped 2.2% or 1061 points to 47,027 as trading resumed after a national holiday on Monday.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng lost 0.1% to 25,839, while Shanghai’s Composite edged up 0.2% to 3,897.56.In South Korea, Kospi added 0.02% to trade at 3,585 at 10:00 AM IST.“Don’t worry about China,” Trump said on his social media platform on Sunday.

The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”The comments come after a turbulent week for markets. The S&P 500 saw its worst drop since April, on Friday following Trump’s criticism of China as “a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations” and his threat of higher tariffs.Despite the tough rhetoric, Trump said he may still meet Xi Jinping later this month at a regional summit, leaving the status of trade talks uncertain.Trump’s wavering on tariffs, along with expectations of several Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, has helped push stocks higher since April. However, critics warn that markets now look expensive, especially in the artificial intelligence sector, drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble in 2000.Broadcom saw one of Monday’s biggest gains in the S&P 500, jumping 9.9% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI to develop AI accelerators for ChatGPT.

The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is still very much on the table even as the two countries get embroiled in escalating trade tensions.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said that he still expects a meeting between the two presidents.""He will be meeting with Party Chair Xi in Korea - I believe that meeting will still go ahead,"" Bessent told Fox Business.He further added that the two sides have had ""substantial communication"" over the weekend after Beijing did not respond to US queries, likely concerning last week’s announcement on rare-earth export controls.The Chinese measures impose strict global controls on products containing even small amounts of certain rare earths, sparking a sharp response from the White House.Earlier on Friday, Trump threatened to cancel his planned meeting with Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month and announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1, Bloomberg reported.""This is China versus the world - they've aimed a bazooka at the supply chains and industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to accept that,"" Bessent said.The treasury chief emphasised that ""we will not let these export restrictions and monitoring continue.

‘Fight to the end’: China warns against Trump’s 100% tariffs; ‘door remains open’ for negotiations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fight-to-the-end-china-warns-against-trumps-100-tariffs-door-remains-open-for-negotiations/articleshow/124541749.cms,"Beijing Warns U.S. Retaliation Coming If Trump Imposes 100% Tariffs On Chinese Goods





China gave a stern warning to the US on Tuesday, saying that it is prepared to “fight to the end” as the trade conflict between the two economic giants continues to grow.These remarks come after US President Donald Trump announced imposing an additional tariff of 100% on Chinese imports to the country. This takes the total tariff on the Asian country to 130%.“On the matter of tariff wars and trade wars, China’s position remains consistent,” said an unnamed spokesperson from the commerce ministry.“If you wish to fight, we shall fight to the end; if you wish to negotiate, our door remains open,” AFP quoted the spokesperson.Trump on Friday said that the new tariffs were a direct response to Beijing’s recent decision to implement wide-ranging export controls on rare earths, a sector where China holds a dominant position.The move also unsettled financial markets and cast doubt over a planned meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. In addition to the tariffs, the US president cautioned that Washington would also introduce export controls “on any and all critical software” from November 1, according to AFP.China defended its actions, calling the rare earths measures legal and necessary. The commerce ministry spokesperson said China wanted to “reiterate that export control measures concerning rare earths and related items constitute legitimate actions by the Chinese government to improve its export control system in accordance with laws and regulations”.“As a responsible major power, China has consistently and resolutely safeguarded its own national security and international collective security,” the spokesperson added.","China says it is prepared to ""fight to the end"" if the U.S. imposes 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.

He shares his views and recommendations for gold investors:

Gold Price Outlook

Gold: Weekly view – Volatile to Positive bias

Silver: Weekly View - Volatile

Gold price prediction today:Gold continued to post its eight consecutive weekly gain last week while it also went past $ 4150 per oz in spot today as renewed US-China trade tensions sent investors flocking to safe-haven assets. Escalating trade tensions between the US & China reignited fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies, boosting safe-haven assets like the Gold. US President Donald Trump announced that he will impose new trade measures against Beijing, including 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods & export controls on critical US-developed software, due to take effect by 1 November. But despite trump adopting a less stringent stance later, prices were seen rallying to new highs.Expectations also mounted for further interest rate cuts by the US Fed, which contributed to Gold’s upside.Markets are currently pricing in an almost certain 25 basis points (bps) rate cut at the Fed’s October meeting, with another reduction expected in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.Primary drivers of the ongoing rally were huge ETF inflows, Fed rate cut expectations & inflation hedging as US Shutdown & de dollarization moves persisted. The US treasuries being held by the central banks fell to the lowest level since 2013 as central banks continue to diversify from US dollar into gold & other assets.Major US data on cards this week include retail sales, PPI final demand numbers, Housing starts, & leading index, which could also be delayed as US shutdown drags on supporting sentiments in gold. Meanwhile, the current rally was met by warnings from agencies like WGC that downside risks could develop in the near term, though broad bias could remain positive through year end.Gold could continue to maintain its bull run challenging $ 4200 per oz on the higher side this week, but downside correction risk continues to increase due to parabolic rise in prices in the last eight consecutive weeks.Meanwhile white metal Silver which had risen on concerns about a lack of liquidity in London have sparked a worldwide hunt, with benchmark prices soaring to near-unprecedented levels over New York since the last few weeks. The global silver market remains less liquid having 8 - 9 times smaller volumes than the gold market, being the reason for amplifying price moves seen. Silver experiencing a perfect storm of temporary market squeezes & long-term structural support, meaning prices could stay volatile in near term. Investors should remain cautious for sharp pullbacks in the short to medium term scenario.In India, Silver ETFs are quoting at a premium compared to futures prices also indicating supply demand imbalance where ETFs are facing severe difficulties in sourcing physical silver. The physical market in India is facing a delivery delay of more than 10 days for delivery of Silver. Meanwhile we continue to anticipate higher end-of-2026 price targets for silver to around $60 – 65 per oz levels, citing persistent market deficits, elevated fiscal gaps & lower interest rates.","Gold prices may cross $4,200 in the international markets this week.

Smartphone exports up 60% in H1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/smartphone-exports-up-60-in-h1/articleshow/124565355.cms,".





New Delhi: Led by Apple , India’s mobile phone exports have shot up by 60% in the first half of this fiscal, closing Apr-Sept FY26 with total shipment of $13.5 billion against $8.5 billion in the same period of 2024-25. In Sept, when new iPhone hit global markets, shipments from India moved up by 95% on total export of $1.8 billion, according to numbers released by India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA).“This confirms that India’s mobile phone manufacturing sector continues to build scale, efficiency, and reliability — three pillars of sustained global competitiveness,” ICEA said, adding that US, UAE, Austria, Netherlands, and the UK were the top destinations for smartphone exports.The share of the US is estimated at around 70% of the total exports during April-Sept 2025, compared to 37% during the same period last year. “This has been led by Apple, which has made India the hub for meeting the requirements of the US customers,” market analysts said.ICEA said exports to the US have surged from $3.1 billion in April-Sept 2024 to an estimated $9.4 billion in April-Sept 2025, registering a growth of almost 200%.“This transformation underlines India’s growing role as a trusted source for global smartphone brands serving advanced markets.” Apple has been boosting production capacity at its two key suppliers in India — Taiwanese Foxconn and Tata group.Apart from Apple, other brands being exported from India include Samsung and Motorola. The Chinese trio of Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi are still focused on catering to the local Indian market, with no aggressive plans for exports.“The sustained rise in exports reflects the strong foundation of India’s mobile phone manufacturing ecosystem. Global value chains are now deeply anchored here,” ICEA chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said.ICEA estimates that mobile phone exports will reach approximately $35 billion in FY26, compared to $24.1 billion in 2024–25. This growth consolidates India’s position among the world’s leading smartphone manufacturing and export destinations.","In Sept, when new iPhone hit global markets, shipments from India moved up by 95% on total export of $1.8 billion.

Teething troubles in new cheque clearing system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/teething-troubles-in-new-cheque-clearing-system/articleshow/124565302.cms,".





Mumbai: The continuous cheque clearing system that came into effect earlier this month was meant to clear cheques within hours. This was to be achieved by banks scanning and sending images of presented cheques for clearing. However, teething troubles have resulted in a high number of rejections, causing cheques to sometimes take over a week to clear—much worse than the next-day clearing that customers were used to.“During these initial days, we have encountered some teething issues both at the central system operated by NPCI and at the participating banks, resulting in delays in clearing and crediting into customers’ accounts, and a large number of returns,” the National Payments Corporation of India said in a statement. It added that most of these issues have now been resolved, and the central system has been stable since Monday, Oct 13.But some customers say their cheques are yet to be cleared. “None of my cheques that have been deposited on and after Oct 3, have been cleared. Amounts have been debited from the payers’ accounts but not credited to my account, so I can’t even ask them to pay through NEFT or another mode of payment,” said Seema P Wadhwa, proprietor of Gidhandas & Co.,adding the delay had disrupted financial planning for her business.According to bankers, delays in cheque clearance under the new system are mainly due to technical integration glitches, poor cheque image quality from rushed scanning, and inadequate staff training, which have led to operational bottlenecks and manual intervention. “NPCI is working with banks to address any remaining issues to ensure same-day credit for cheques,” the corporation said.","The continuous cheque clearing system that came into effect earlier this month was meant to clear cheques within hours.

Silver rush: Global shortage spurs buying,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-rush-global-shortage-spurs-buying/articleshow/124565274.cms,".





Mumbai: A global shortage of silver is creating chaos across bullion and commodities markets, and India is also feeling the pinch. In the domestic market, there’s a huge difference between the price of silver futures for delivery in Dec and the spot market price, while several mutual fund houses have stopped taking money in their silver ETF’s fund of funds schemes.In a related development, on Tuesday, as a precautionary risk-containment measure MCX, the largest commodities bourse in India, increased margins on silver contracts by 1.5 percentage points. Till Monday, the margin on these contracts was 11.5%, MCX said.A host of factors have contributed to this rally. Global economic uncertainty, geopolitical issues like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, rising demand for the white metal from thriving industries like solar, electric vehicles and semiconductors, and increasing investment demands acted as tailwinds for silver, said Darshan Desai, CEO, Aspect Bullion.Closure of some of the mines that produced silver earlier but found it unproductive at persistently low prices for several years, also contributed to this sudden supply-demand mismatch, a fund manager said. On the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday, where silver is no longer traded but there is a vibrant market for leasing the white metals among global traders and dealers, the loan rates for this precious metal shot up to about 39% from less than 5% just a week ago, news reports said.In the domestic market, in spot trades, silver prices were hovering around the Rs 1.9 lakh/kg level, a premium of 20% over the Dec futures price on MCX which was at about Rs 1.62 lakh.According to Rahul Kalantri of Mehta Equities, the difference is mainly because of the crazy demand for silver among retail buyers in the spot market while on the MCX it’s the large buyers, traders and jewellers who are present. Also, on MCX, the delivery of silver traded today is set for a future date while in the local market some buyers are buying because of Diwali and also the wedding season, factors that can’t be delayed much.“This abnormal price trend is expected to settle down to normal levels in about 8-10 days…once the euphoria subsides and the festive season (Diwali) is over,” Kalantri said. The current euphoric buying of the white metal has its roots in the two-year rally. Since Oct 2023, in the international market the price of silver has more than doubled: From about $22 to over $50 now.","A global shortage of silver is creating chaos across bullion and commodities markets.

Listing’s Good: LG India’s 50% surge a D-St record,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/listings-good-lg-indias-50-surge-a-d-st-record/articleshow/124565239.cms,".





Mumbai: LG Electronics India, the domestic arm of the Korea-headquartered LG Electronics, had a blockbuster listing on Tuesday with the stock gaining 50% on its debut over its IPO price. The stock listed at Rs 1,710, over its IPO price of Rs 1,140.The strong gain in the stock price gave LG Electronics India a market capitalisation of nearly $13 billion, 40% more than its parent’s $7.8 billion valuation, Bloomberg data showed. This made LG Electronics India one of the handful of companies that have market valuation greater than their overseas parent. Maruti Suzuki is one of those companies.On Oct 9, LG Electronics India closed one of the most successful IPOs in Indian history, garnering nearly Rs 4.4 lakh crore in demand for its shares compared to Rs 11,607 crore worth of shares which were on offer. The IPO was subscribed 54 times. This was the second biggest amount ever collected in any IPO in India ever.Nearly 10.2 crore shares were offered in the IPO which was a 100% offer for sale by its Korean parent. In the IPO, the shares were offered at a price band of Rs 1,080 – Rs 1,140.On Tuesday on BSE, the stock opened for trading at Rs 1,710 and closed slightly off that mark at Rs 1,689, up 48%. On the NSE, nearly 6.9 crore shares changed hands while on BSE another 78.6 lakh shares were traded.As LG Electronics India was listed, a host of brokerages initiated their coverage of the stock. Domestic financial services major Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a target of Rs 1,800, while ICICI Securities has put the target price at Rs 1,700, Emkay Global at Rs 2,050, Antique Broking at Rs 1,725, Prabhudas Liladher at Rs 1,780, Equirus Capital at Rs 1,705, Ambit Capital at Rs 1,820 and Nomura at Rs 1,800.LG Electronics India’s was the second billion-dollar-plus IPO during the last week, a rare event in India. The Rs 15,512-crore IPO for Tata Capital was the first one that opened on Oct 6 and closed on Oct 8. The issue was subscribed two times.The LG India IPO also broke a nearly 15-year old jinx for billion-dollar IPOs that showed muted listing. In Nov 2015, Coal India that closed its Rs 15,500-crore IPO the previous month, was listed with a 48% premium. Since then, the billion-dollar IPOs had muted listing, mostly with single-digit percentage gains.","LG Electronics India, the domestic arm of the Korea-headquartered LG Electronics, had a blockbuster listing on Tuesday.

Residents in several parts of the UAE are being advised to brace for rainy weather, lower temperatures, and dusty winds between Friday, October 10, and Tuesday, October 14, as a shifting weather system moves through the region, primarily affecting the northern and eastern areas.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast a period of unstable weather conditions starting Friday, October 10, through Tuesday, October 14, due to the influence of an extended surface low-pressure system from the south and an upper-level low carrying relatively cold and humid air. These upper-level low-pressure systems tend to intensify with altitude and are typically linked with cloud development and rainfall.During this five-day stretch, weather models indicate that areas most likely to experience rain include Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain, while major coastal cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are expected to remain largely dry. The Windy app projects the rain will begin on Sunday. Forecasts describe the expected rainfall as light to moderate overall, with some areas experiencing heavy rain intermittently. This weather activity is expected to affect primarily the northern and eastern regions, with the potential to extend inland and toward some western areas.There is also a limited chance of hailstones forming in certain locations.In addition to rain, a noticeable drop in temperatures is expected across several affected regions. Windy conditions may intensify at times, potentially kicking up dust and sand. These conditions may reduce visibility in some areas and could affect outdoor plans, especially during the weekend. Sea conditions are also likely to be impacted, with wave activity in both the Arabian Gulf and the Oman Sea ranging from slight to moderate, occasionally becoming rough.September and October are typically among the most humid months of the year in the UAE, with humidity sometimes reaching 100 percent. However, this year has seen relatively drier conditions leading up to this weather shift. With forecasts predicting a cooler, wetter period, residents and travelers are advised to monitor updates and plan accordingly.","From October 10-14, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain are expected to experience light to moderate rain and dust.

Sfeer Loyalty Program: A community-centric approach

Hafawa Lounge: Riyadh Air’s first premium ground experience

Strategic significance: Vision 2030 and the aviation push









Saudi Arabia’s newest national airline, Riyadh Air, is preparing for a strategic soft launch of its first international route — daily flights between Riyadh and London Heathrow — beginning October 26, 2025. While tickets won’t be publicly available yet, this tightly managed rollout marks a crucial proving phase as the airline gears up for full-scale commercial operations in 2026.Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a future global aviation leader, with this initial route serving not only as a testbed for systems, aircraft, and service procedures, but also as a key milestone in the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy.Riyadh Air’s first operational route will connect King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with London Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest and most tightly controlled hubs. But these initial flights won’t be open for general ticket sales. Instead, the seats will be available exclusively to Riyadh Air employees, staff at the airline’s owner — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) — and their families.The reason for this controlled opening is strategic. While the airline secured a pair of coveted Heathrow slots back in June for the Northern Hemisphere winter season, it does not yet have its own aircraft. Riyadh Air’s order with Boeing for 72 Dreamliners — 39 firm orders for the 787-9 model and 33 options — originally targeted first deliveries by December 2024. That schedule has now been pushed back due to production delays, with the first jets now expected in late 2025.To avoid losing the Heathrow slots under the airport’s strict “use it or lose it” rules, Riyadh Air is launching the route using a leased Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Oman Air. The aircraft, named Jamila and registered as HZ-RXX, is currently being used for pilot training, certification flights, and operational trials.Passengers on these early flights will be considered “Launch Members” and will be invited to share detailed feedback on every part of the journey — from booking and boarding to in-flight experience and ground handling. Tickets for these flights will only be available through the airline’s newly unveiled loyalty platform, Sfeer.Speaking at the official announcement, Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas made it clear that this staged approach is a deliberate choice, not a compromise.“If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won’t,” he said. “So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.”The new Riyadh–London route spans 3,070 miles with a flight time of approximately 7 hours, making Riyadh Air the fourth airline to operate on this corridor.While Saudia currently maintains a strong presence on the route, it is gradually withdrawing from Riyadh-based services to make way for Riyadh Air, which will become the Kingdom's flagship international airline.Though Riyadh Air is just beginning operations, its long-term ambitions are substantial. The airline was officially announced in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a cornerstone of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, an economic diversification plan that seeks to position Riyadh as a global business and tourism hub.Riyadh Air plans to serve over 100 destinations worldwide by 2030, supported by a modern, fuel-efficient fleet and a focus on premium service across every touchpoint. The scale of its ambition is reflected in its extensive aircraft order book:Riyadh Air’s expansion plans are backed by a massive and diversified aircraft order portfolio:This strategic mix aims to equip the airline with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet for both regional and long-haul destinations.Following the launch of its first route to London, Riyadh Air’s next confirmed destination will be Dubai International Airport. The Riyadh–Dubai corridor is among the busiest in the region, with more than 30 daily flights at peak times, operated by a mix of low-cost and full-service carriers. This route will also mark Riyadh Air’s first direct competition with Emirates, which currently operates three daily Boeing 777-300ER services on the same sector.In parallel, Riyadh Air has been forming strategic partnerships to expand its global reach, including a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore potential codesharing and loyalty program alignment.Alongside the launch announcement, Riyadh Air introduced Sfeer, a digital-first loyalty program designed to reflect modern user behavior and local cultural values. The name — which means “ambassador” in Arabic and echoes the English word “sphere” — captures the program’s vision of building a connected and collaborative member community.Unlike traditional airline programs that reward individual travel spend, Sfeer promotes engagement, inclusivity, and shared progress. Members can share level points with family and friends, advancing together toward higher tiers — a model the airline says reflects Saudi values of generosity and togetherness.In its early access phase, Sfeer is open to Riyadh Air’s internal community, but it will be expanded in phases. Early registrants, dubbed “Founders,” will gain priority access to ticket sales on upcoming flights and invitations to exclusive events. When fully launched in 2026, the program will include gamified challenges, member leaderboards, and a no-expiry points policy. Additional benefits will include complimentary onboard Wi-Fi and special partner offers.Douglas positioned Sfeer as a loyalty program that goes beyond points.“We’re emphasizing inclusivity and engagement, rather than the individual transactional models of traditional airline loyalty programs,” he said. “We want this to be community-driven and digitally immersive — not just another points system.”Riyadh Air has also unveiled its first premium lounge, the ‘Hafawa Lounge’ — located between Terminals 1 and 2 at King Khalid International Airport.The lounge is positioned as an extension of Riyadh Air’s commitment to providing a luxury experience and serves as part of its overall operational trial period. As the airline ramps up toward full public service, every touchpoint, from lounge to inflight, is being tested and refined.Riyadh Air was established in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 — the national strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing reliance on oil. The airline’s objectives are closely aligned with the broader ambitions of its owner, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which include transforming Riyadh into a global aviation hub, attracting 330 million passengers annually by 2030, and enhancing international connectivity through strategic partnerships.One such partnership includes a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore future code-sharing agreements and potential loyalty program integration. Riyadh Air forms just one part of the PIF’s expansive investments in the aviation ecosystem, which also span airports, logistics, and supporting infrastructure across the Kingdom.","Riyadh Air will launch its first London flights on October 26 using a leased Boeing 787-9 for staff only.

AI exuberance like dot-com boom: IMF,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-exuberance-like-dot-com-boom-imf/articleshow/124565287.cms,".





New Delhi: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that the surging investment in artificial intelligence echoes the dot-com boom of the late 1990s and it could pose risks. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said in a blog after the release of the World Economic Outlook update that optimism is fuelling tech investment, lifting stock valuations, and boosting consumption via capital gains.“This could push the real neutral interest rate upwards. Continued exuberance may require tighter monetary policy just as in the late 1990s,” said Gourinchas. “But there is also a flip side. Markets could reprice sharply, especially if AI fails to justify lofty profit expectations. That would dent wealth and curb consumption, with adverse effects potentially reverberating through the financial system,” the IMF chief economist cautioned in his blog under the sub-title “The AI surge, promise or peril?”WEO also said an abrupt repricing of tech stocks could be triggered by disappointing results on earnings and productivity gains related to artificial intelligence (AI), marking an end to the AI investment boom and the associated exuberance of financial markets, with the possibility of broader implications for macro-financial stability.It said that much of the year’s equity market gains have come from a rally in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. “The stretched valuations and calm relative to the challenges raise the risk of market volatility and asset price correction should uncertainty start biting and economic indicators, including productivity gains from generative AI investments, start to disappoint.“The decline in aggregate investment could be rather sharp, given that investment in data centers and AI was a significant contributor to investment growth recently,” according to the WEO. The report also said that artificial intelligence is reigniting productivity growth. “Faster AI adoption could help unleash strong productivity gains as firms increase uptake of the various AI-based tools being developed and deployed at high speed,” said the report.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that the surging investment in artificial intelligence echoes the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.

From chips to ships: China just weaponised the sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-trade-war-xi-jinping-donald-trump-china-escalates-us-trade-fight-with-curbs-on-shipping/articleshow/124555923.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

China sanctioned the US units of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean and warned of more retaliatory steps across shipping - a fresh front in the escalating China-US trade war just as both countries roll out tit-for-tat port fees.

The move “helped fuel a slump in global equities” and signaled a broader fight over maritime dominance, Bloomberg reported. “This is a broadening and expansion of the ongoing trade conflict,” Deborah Elms of the Hinrich Foundation told Bloomberg. “It’s no longer just about tariffs and export controls, but which firms have the ability to operate in which markets. If this continues, a lot more economic activities are at risk.”

At the same time, the US began charging fees on Chinese ships docking at American ports - penalties aimed at countering China’s shipbuilding supremacy and nudging orders away from Chinese yards.

“Anything we can do to chip away at the disparity in shipbuilding that exists between the United States and China is to our benefit,” Mihir Torsekar of the Coalition for a Prosperous America told the NYT.

Why it matters

Ships move over 80% of global trade, so port levies and sanctions can ripple through everything from crude and LNG to toys and sofas, raising shipping costs and delivery times across supply chains.

Allies are in the crosshairs. By sanctioning Hanwha’s US units, Beijing is warning third-country firms that help Washington they could lose China access - a pressure test for South Korea and others balancing security ties with US market exposure.

Capacity reshuffle = higher costs. Carriers are already reassigning ships to dodge fees on Chinese-built vessels calling at US ports; analysts say 11% of container ships and 13% of crude tankers could be affected, a meaningful slice that can snarl routes and lift rates.

China’s scale advantage is stubborn. With 60% of global large-vessel output in 2024 and faster, cheaper builds, China’s yards remain hard to dislodge - meaning US fees may re-route traffic more than they rebuild domestic capacity in the near term.

Seas of retaliation

Floating tariffs, sinking certainty

A broader economic risk

The standoff is playing out just as the IMF nudged up its forecast for US economic growth to 2% in 2025, citing resilient consumer demand and investment in AI infrastructure. Yet even the IMF acknowledged the gains might be short-lived if tariffs escalate. “The tariff shock is here,” said chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, “and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects.”

The agency noted that importers and retailers in the US-not foreign producers-are bearing the brunt of the new duties. And over time, those costs are likely to bleed into consumer prices.

On Friday, US President Donald Trump threatened to slap 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods by November 1 if Beijing doesn’t relent on rare earth restrictions. Within hours, markets dropped, and Chinese state media accused Washington of ""economic coercion.""

threatened to slap 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods by November 1 if Beijing doesn’t relent on rare earth restrictions. Within hours, markets dropped, and Chinese state media accused Washington of ""economic coercion."" Trump took to Truth Social to cool the rhetoric, posting: “Don’t worry about China. It will all be fine!” But behind the scenes, talks between Vice finance minister Liao Min and US Treasury officials are ongoing in Washington.

“China’s door remains open,” the commerce ministry said. “But if the US chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end.”

Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!! President DJT Donald Trump on Truth Social

Bottom line





Beijing has fired its latest salvo in the simmering US-China trade war-not through semiconductors or soybeans, but through ships. China imposed sanctions on the US subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilding giant Hanwha Ocean Co, citing the company’s support of an American trade probe as grounds for economic punishment.At the heart of the dispute is control over the ocean highways of global commerce. China, over the past decade, has quietly built a commanding lead in shipbuilding, outpacing South Korea and Japan to control 60% of large vessel production by 2024. The US, by contrast, made just one such ship that year.Trump’s administration, frustrated by years of imbalance, has tried to reverse course. On Tuesday, it began imposing new port fees on Chinese ships-part of a broader effort to resuscitate a withered US shipbuilding industry. In return, China hit American ships with fees of its own. The fees target any vessel owned, operated, built, or flagged by the opposing country, turning each nation’s ports into tollbooths in a maritime standoff.Both sides have carved out technical exemptions-China, for example, said Chinese-built ships are exempt from its new port levies-but the message is unmistakable.Trade is no longer safe in open waters.“This tit-for-tat symmetry locks both economies into a spiral of maritime taxation,risking distortions in global freight flows,” Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers told Reuters.At the same time, Trump has widened his tariff campaign at home. New duties-ranging from 10% on raw wood to 50% on kitchen cabinets-also took effect Tuesday, targeting everything from timber to upholstered furniture. Trump defended the move under the rarely-invoked Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which allows tariffs on national security grounds. His logic? Furniture and wood are essential to military infrastructure.As per a NYT report, critics call it a stretch. “If war broke out tomorrow,” wrote Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute, “there would be zero concern about American ‘dependence’ on foreign lumber.” He called the idea that tariffs would protect national security “absurd.”Retailers and builders are already feeling the pinch. “Getting manufacturing started in the US isn’t easy,” Ethan Allen CEO Farooq Kathwari, who noted his company has factories in Vermont and North Carolina. “We have all these hurdles,” Kathwari told the NYT.Beijing is matching - and expanding - the fight beyond tariff lines to the docks and drydocks, signaling it will penalize firms that abet US probes while leveraging its shipbuilding heft. Washington is betting vessel fees plus fresh tariffs will tilt orders, revive US yards and pry supply chains from China’s orbit. For now, the world’s freight lanes are the battlefield - and the bill for consumers and companies is mounting.(With inputs from agencies)",China sanctioned the US units of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean and warned of more retaliatory steps across shipping.

Wall Street stocks slipped in early trading on Tuesday as trade tensions with China resurfaced, putting pressure on major indices. The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 383 points or 0.8 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite shed 1.5 per cent as of 9:57 a.m. Eastern time, AP reported.The decline adds to recent volatility, following Wall Street’s worst day since April last Friday and a rebound on Monday, which was the best day since May. Analysts said the swings reflected shifting sentiment over US-China trade relations.The latest downturn came after China’s Commerce Ministry barred Chinese companies from dealing with five subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, a move seen as countering President Donald Trump’s efforts to rebuild US shipbuilding. European markets were also lower, while Asian markets fell.The ongoing US-China trade conflict continues to weigh on investors, with both nations imposing new port fees on each other’s vessels that took effect on Tuesday. Experts say the dispute is particularly significant given the two countries’ positions as the world’s largest economies.So far, the US economy has avoided major fallout from shifting tariff policies, but analysts warn that a cycle of retaliatory tariffs could lead companies to pass higher costs to consumers.The ongoing US government shutdown has also paused regular economic updates on inflation, spending, and employment, leaving investors focused on corporate earnings for guidance.Among stocks, JPMorgan Chase slipped 3.8 per cent despite beating profit forecasts for its latest quarter, while Wells Fargo rose 3.5 per cent after exceeding analysts’ expectations. Health care giant Johnson & Johnson fell 1.8 per cent after announcing plans to spin off its orthopedics business into a standalone company.Treasury yields remained relatively stable, with the 10-year yield easing slightly to 4.04 per cent from 4.05 per cent on Friday. Bond markets were closed on Monday for a US holiday.","The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 383 points, and the Nasdaq composite shed 1.5 per cent.

How Jensen Huang's cousin Lisa Su is coming for Nvidia's AI throne,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-jensen-huangs-cousin-lisa-su-is-coming-for-nvidias-ai-throne/articleshow/124553800.cms,"The Big Picture



1. From near-bankruptcy to $348 billion powerhouse



2. A megadeal that puts AMD squarely in Nvidia’s crosshairs



3. The engineer’s engineer vs. the showman



4. A family rivalry with geopolitical stakes



5. The road ahead







In 2023, a Wall Street analyst summed up the AI hardware boom with a single brutal metaphor: “There’s a war going on out there in A.I., and Nvidia is the only arms dealer.” But what happens when the arms dealer’s own blood comes for the throne? Lisa Su — the soft-spoken engineer who once took apart a broken toy car just to see how it worked — has spent a decade quietly turning AMD into the most formidable challenger Jensen Huang has ever faced. And in a twist straight out of a corporate soap opera, the woman threatening Nvidia’s empire isn’t a rival from Silicon Valley’s usual suspects. She’s Huang’s distant cousin.For two decades, Nvidia has been the undisputed king of graphics processors and the brains behind artificial intelligence. But AMD, under Lisa Su’s leadership since 2014, is now poised to become a genuine alternative — and perhaps the only company with the scale, technical depth, and strategic patience to challenge Nvidia’s supremacy.When Su took over AMD, the company was barely worth $3 billion and had lost almost all relevance in data centres. Intel ruled CPUs, Nvidia ruled GPUs, and AMD was seen as an also-ran. In a decade, she’s flipped that narrative: AMD’s market value has soared to $348 billion, its data-centre CPU share has climbed to 41%, and its chips power everything from PlayStation and Xbox consoles to cutting-edge cloud servers.Her formula was old-school Silicon Valley: focus on engineering, stay lean, and build for performance rather than chasing volume.While Intel was sinking billions into fabs, Su doubled down on chip design — cramming billions of transistors into tiny silicon wafers and betting early on high-performance computing.The real breakthrough came this week: OpenAI inked a deal to buy 6 gigawatts worth of AMD’s AI chips, a contract worth tens of billions of dollars and a direct challenge to Nvidia’s market dominance. The agreement also gives OpenAI up to 160 million AMD shares if performance milestones are met — a controversial move that Huang publicly mocked but one that cements AMD’s seat at the AI top table.The result: AMD’s stock price surged more than 33% in a week. The message from Wall Street was clear — Nvidia finally has a rival worth worrying about.Su’s approach to leadership contrasts sharply with Huang’s. He built Nvidia into a juggernaut not just with cutting-edge hardware but also with CUDA, a proprietary software ecosystem that locks developers into Nvidia chips. AMD, by contrast, has struggled with software — even receiving public criticism from analysts for buggy platforms.But instead of ignoring it, Su called one critic personally, spent 90 minutes dissecting his arguments, and thanked him publicly: “Feedback is a gift.” That humility and technical rigour have become her calling card.Born in Taiwan and raised in Queens, Su is the daughter of a mathematician and an accountant — and a distant relative of Huang. But their rivalry is no family drama; it’s a strategic contest that now has global implications.Nvidia controls over 75% of the AI data-centre GPU market, and its chips power the models that are transforming industries. But governments, hyperscalers, and AI labs increasingly want alternatives to avoid a single-vendor chokehold. Su is building precisely that — a second source of high-end AI silicon for the age of generative intelligence.AMD still trails Nvidia in both market share and ecosystem depth. CUDA’s dominance, Nvidia’s early lead, and the sheer inertia of developer loyalty are formidable obstacles. But with the MI300 GPU series, a pipeline of next-gen AI hardware, and partnerships like the one with OpenAI, AMD is no longer the underdog — it’s the contender.As Forrest Norrod, Su’s first hire and head of data-centre products, put it: “Before Lisa, AMD was chasing the mainstream. Now we’re chasing the performance crown.” And in AI, performance isn’t just about chips — it’s about who shapes the future of computing itself.Bottom line: The AI race is no longer a solo sprint. Huang may have defined the era of AI hardware, but Su is quietly rewriting the next chapter — one transistor at a time.","Lisa Su has spent a decade quietly turning AMD into the most formidable challenger Jensen Huang has ever faced.

JPMorgan's $1.5 trillion plan: CEO Jamie Dimon plans to hire more experts; 'just give us a call',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jpmorgans-1-5-trillion-plan-ceo-jamie-dimon-plans-to-hire-more-experts-just-give-us-a-call/articleshow/124549552.cms,"Four key areas of investment





JPMorgan is hiring as part of its ambitious $1.5 trillion US “resiliency” plan, CEO Jamie Dimon announced on Monday.The bank is looking for financial specialists in defence, energy, artificial intelligence, and advanced manufacturing to help build an investment team. This team will deploy $10 billion in capital before the bank involves its bankers.“If you think you're the right person, just give us a call,” Dimon told reporters, inviting interested professionals to join the initiative. He added that the bank wants to hire a “top-notch investment team” to invest the $10 billion in companies that can give the US an edge over its competitors.“We're very focused on people,” the CEO said, as quoted by Business Insider.The plan, called the security and resiliency Initiative, aims to strengthen US security, innovation, and infrastructure using private sector funding rather than relying on government agencies. To achieve this, JPMorgan will prioritise hiring experts in four key areas: defence and aerospace, frontier technologies like AI and quantum computing, energy independence, and advanced manufacturing and supply chains.The hirings are a part of a wider initiative worth $1.5 trillion. As part of the 10-year plan, the bank will invest up to $10 billion in companies across defence, energy, manufacturing, and emerging technologies.To fulfil the mission requirements, the bank is set to hire more experts. These include bankers, investment professionals and others. An external advisory council, including public- and private-sector leaders, will provide guidance. Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management, and Doug Petno, Co-CEO of commercial and investment banking, will oversee the programme. Both are also considered potential successors to Dimon.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the initiative is entirely a bank-led effort and not driven by the Trump administration. “This is a JPMorgan initiative…100% commercial,” he told journalists, responding to repeated questions about government involvement, as quoted by Reuters.Dimon noted that the US has become too reliant on foreign sources of critical minerals and essential products, which are vital for national security.“America needs more speed and investment,” he added, calling for policy reforms to tackle regulatory delays and workforce challenges.While the programme is commercial, JPMorgan is working closely with the US government. The bank helped structure a deal with rare earths mining firm MP Materials and has held numerous calls and visits to Washington to explore similar opportunities. Andrew Castaldo, co-head of mid-cap mergers and acquisitions, said the bank has had “no less than 100 calls with clients” to discuss the MP transaction and other sectors.The bank’s strategy focuses on four main sectors: supply chain and manufacturing, defence and aerospace, energy independence, and frontier technologies. Within these areas, 27 sub-sectors have been identified, including shipbuilding, nuclear energy, nanomaterials, and secure communications. Both middle-market companies and large corporations will be eligible for investment.","JPMorgan is hiring financial specialists in defence, energy, artificial intelligence, and advanced manufacturing to help build an investment team.

JPMorgan Chase on Monday unveiled a $1.5 trillion plan to bolster key US industries, including rare minerals, shipbuilding, and nuclear energy, in a move it described as critical for national security and economic resilience.The US banking giant, which manages assets of about $3.8 trillion, said it would deploy direct equity and venture capital investments of up to $10 billion in select companies. It also plans to facilitate funding for projects deemed essential to the nation’s economic security, according to an announcement on its website, AFP reported.CEO Jamie Dimon framed the initiative as a response to growing global uncertainties. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Dimon cited conflicts in Ukraine and other international hotspots as evidence that “the world is far from safe” and warned that US dependence on external sources for critical minerals and manufacturing could threaten national security.“The US has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products, and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security,” Dimon wrote.“Our adversaries and potential adversaries aren’t waiting — we no longer have the luxury of time.”The plan spans JPMorgan’s investment and commercial banking arms, and will include efforts to support research and development, streamline permitting, and navigate regulatory hurdles. Priority sectors include defense and aerospace, energy independence, and supply chain resilience. The initiative also identifies 27 sub-areas such as AI, where the US leads globally, alongside sectors like shipbuilding where the country lags (AFP).Supply chain weaknesses became especially visible during the Covid-19 pandemic, when semiconductor shortages disrupted auto manufacturing and other industries. To address such vulnerabilities, Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act in 2022, authorising $280 billion to strengthen domestic production, the bank noted.The initiative comes amid heightened focus on critical materials under the Trump administration, which has taken stakes in private companies such as Intel and MP Materials, a departure from traditional US free-market practices.

Wall Street staged a strong rebound on Monday as US stocks rallied following President Donald Trump’s calmer comments on trade with China, just days after his threats of higher tariffs had rattled global markets.The S&P 500 surged 1.5% to recover more than half of Friday’s drop, its steepest since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 561 points, or 1.2%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 2% as of 12:02 p.m. Eastern time, AP reported.“Don’t worry about China,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday. He added that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, “doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The US wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”The shift followed Trump’s Friday comments, when he had accused China of being “a moral disgrace in dealing with other nations” and threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting Nov. 1, citing Beijing’s “extremely hostile” letter on rare earth export curbs. China urged the US to resolve differences through negotiations rather than threats, stating online: “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one. ”Trump’s backtrack ahead of Monday trading helped lift market sentiment, raising hopes that the world’s two largest economies could maintain a functioning trade relationship.The market’s volatility echoes April’s swings, when Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement initially shocked investors before a series of eventual relaxations.Morgan Stanley strategists, led by Michael Wilson, said if trade tensions ease similarly this time, conditions could allow a rolling recovery into 2026.The S&P 500 had already been under pressure after a nearly continuous 35% run since April. Analysts noted that the index remains near all-time highs, prompting concerns that stock prices are outpacing corporate profit growth, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector, where some see echoes of the 2000 dot-com bubble.Broadcom posted a 10% gain, the biggest in the S&P 500 on Monday, following its announcement of a collaboration with OpenAI to design custom AI accelerators. Conversely, Fastenal fell 4.8% after slightly weaker-than-expected quarterly profits.Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian expressed optimism that S&P 500 companies could outperform analyst expectations in the upcoming earnings season, citing the resilient US economy and a weaker US dollar that boosts overseas sales.Internationally, European markets edged higher, while Asian indexes saw mixed performances. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.5%, and Shanghai dropped 0.2% after China reported an 8.3% increase in global exports in September compared with a year earlier, its strongest growth in six months, reflecting a shift in Chinese manufacturers toward non-US markets.","The S&P 500 surged 1.5% to recover more than half of Friday’s drop.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates continue to hover in a range as news on Donald Trump’s trade policies flows in. Where are gold prices headed and what should investors do?Gold futures remain under pressure as the MCX Gold October Futures contract struggles to recover from recent declines. After a brief pullback from the intraday lows, prices are currently hovering around ₹98,778, with key technical indicators pointing to a weak rebound lacking bullish momentum. In light of the current setup, traders are advised to adopt a Sell on Rise strategy near ₹99,000, with a stop-loss at ₹99,450.The 8-period EMA is at ₹98,765, and the 21-period EMA is at ₹98,800. Price is trying to reclaim these levels but is struggling to close decisively above either, indicating hesitation and overhead resistance. A failure to sustain above ₹99,000 would confirm bearish control.A clear lower-high lower-low formation dominates the 15-minute chart. The attempt to bounce back from the ₹98,600–₹98,700 zone is facing headwinds from the declining short-term moving averages. Selling interest is visible on every upward tick.Despite a modest bounce, volume remains uneven and not supportive of a bullish reversal. Open interest trends also suggest caution, with no aggressive long buildup detected.This favors the view of a corrective pullback rather than a trend change.The previous day’s pivot and price action suggest that the ₹99,000–₹99,200 range remains a critical resistance zone. The multiple failed attempts to hold above this level make it an ideal sell zone for intraday setups.• The RSI is approaching the 50–52 zone but has not broken above convincingly, implying weak upside momentum.• While the MACD is not visible in the chart, the price structure suggests a shallow or weak crossover at best, lacking strength to confirm bullish continuation.Given the confluence of resistance around ₹99,000, lack of follow-through volume, and weak momentum, traders may consider a Sell on Rise strategy in the range of ₹99,000–₹99,100, maintaining a stop-loss at ₹99,450. Downside targets include ₹98,550, followed by ₹98,200 if selling intensifies. Until the price decisively breaks and sustains above the 21 EMA with supportive volume, the trend remains vulnerable to further declines.","Gold futures remain under pressure as the MCX Gold October Futures contract struggles to recover from recent declines.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remain highly volatile amid escalating trade tensions between India and the United States. The heightened uncertainty is primarily driven by ongoing developments surrounding potential tariff measures. In a recent statement, US President Donald Trump suggested the imposition of a 25% tariff on Indian exports, a move that has raised concerns across markets.This proposed tariff hike has triggered anxiety among investors, who fear the repercussions it could have on bilateral trade relations and the broader economic outlook. As a result, key stock indices are experiencing sharp fluctuations, reflecting the market's sensitivity to geopolitical and trade-related developments. Market participants are closely monitoring official responses and further policy announcements from both nations to gauge the potential impact on corporate earnings and economic growth.Going ahead, index to consolidate in the range of 24,500-25,000 in the coming sessions.While a move above 25,000 levels will open further upside towards the key resistance area of 25,250, being the almost identical high of the last 2 weeks.Volatility is anticipated to remain elevated in the coming session, driven by key macro triggers including the US- India tariff decision and the RBI rate decision.On the downside, the 24,600–24,400 zone emerges as a critical demand area, marking a confluence of key technical levels — the prior swing low, the 100-day exponential moving average, and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent up move from 23,935 to 25,669.Bank Nifty on Thursday session rebounded from the key support area of 55,500-55,000 levels being the confluence of the 100-day EMA and key Fibonacci retracement levels of the prior up moveSince April, intermediate corrections have remained shallow while the index has consistently held above its 100-day EMA.Structurally, the index is undergoing a time-wise correction rather than a steep price correction, which is a constructive sign in the context of a prevailing uptrend. The formation of higher base patterns near the key moving average support zone, along with subdued retracements, implies that stronger hands are utilizing dips to accumulate.Going ahead we expect the index to hold above the support area of 55,500-55,000 levels and head higher towards 57,500 and 58,300 levels in the coming weeks.Buy in the range of Rs 1050-1070The stock after the recent corrective decline is forming base around the 61.8% retracement of the previous up move (933-1238). The stock provides favorable risk reward set up for the next leg of the up moveThe stock has already taken 14 weeks to retrace just 61.8% of its preceding 13 weeks up move (933-1238). A shallow retracement signals a positive price structure. The weekly stochastic has approached an extreme oversold territory with a reading of 08, hence a technical pullback is likely in the coming weeks.We expect the stock to head higher towards 1175 levels being the 61.8% retracement of the 1247-1055.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling channel containing last one month’s corrective decline with a bullish gap up action signaling resumption of up move.The stock is currently trading above its short- and long-term moving averages thus validating positive bias from a medium-term perspective.We expect stocks to maintain positive bias and head towards an all time high of 3963 in the coming months, being the measuring implication of the range consolidation.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Axis Bank, and Larsen and Toubro are the top stock picks for today.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a trade agreement with South Korea, imposing a 15% tariff on imports from Seoul, as part of what he called a “full and complete trade deal” between the two nations.He further declared that America won’t be subjected to any tariffs.As part of the deal, the Asian nation will also provide $350 billion for investments in the United States, which will be owned, controlled, and personally selected by Trump.Moreover, South Korea will also buy $100 billion worth of LNG or other energy products, and has also agreed to invest a major amount for investment.Posting on Truth Social, the US president said, ""I am pleased to announce that the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with the Republic of Korea. The Deal is that South Korea will give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President.""He added, ""Additionally, South Korea will purchase $100 Billion Dollars of LNG, or other Energy products and, further, South Korea has agreed to invest a large sum of money for their Investment purposes. This sum will be announced within the next two weeks when the President of South Korea, Lee Jae Myung, comes to the White House for a Bilateral Meeting.""Trump also congratulated South Korea’s new president, saying, ""I would also like to congratulate the new President on his Electoral Success.""He also said that the deal would open South Korea ""completely"" to American goods, declaring, ""they will accept American product including Cars and Trucks, Agriculture, etc.""A 15% tariff will be applied to South Korean exports, while American goods will face no such charge.The announcement comes just ahead of President Lee Jae Myung’s first bilateral meeting with Trump at the White House since taking office in June, after the impeachment of former leader Yoon Suk Yeol following a failed martial law attempt.Reacting to the deal in a Facebook post, Lee described it as ""the first major trade challenge"" of his administration, saying, ""We have overcome a major hurdle.""""Through this deal, the government has eliminated uncertainty surrounding export conditions and ensured that US tariffs on our exports are either lower than or equal to those imposed on our major trade competitors,"" Lee said.The agreement marks a significant early win for Lee, who now leads Asia’s fourth-largest economy at a time when its export-heavy industries are under global pressure.Lee added, ""This agreement represents the convergence of US interests in revitalizing its manufacturing sector and our determination to strengthen Korean companies' competitiveness in the American market.""Trump concluded his post by thanking South Korean officials, saying, ""I would like to thank the Trade Representatives who came forward today. It was an Honor to meet them, and talk about the Great Success of their Country!""Since his return to the White House in January, Trump has pursued aggressive trade measures, rolling out a blanket 10% tariff on both allies and competitors. Those rates are set to climb from August 1, with particularly steep increases on select nations, 25% on imports from India and 50% on those from Brazil.Trump indicated the Brazil tariffs were in part retaliation for what he labelled a ""witch hunt"" against Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president and his far-right ally, currently facing a criminal trial.","US President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with South Korea, imposing a 15% tariff on imports from Seoul.

NEW DELHI: The government is exploring options to respond to US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, but has ruled out any immediate retaliation, Bloomberg reported.The government is also considering steps to maintain trade relations, including increasing imports from the US, but is not planning any new defence purchases, according to people familiar with the matter cited by Bloomberg.India has told US officials that it is not interested in acquiring the F-35 stealth fighter jets, despite continued American efforts to expand defence exports to New Delhi, Bloomberg reported. The Modi government is unlikely to approve any major new defence deals with the US in the near future, the report said.The report also says that officials in New Delhi were ""shocked and disappointed"" by Trump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday. However, the government wants to keep trade talks on track and is looking at options to increase purchases from its largest trading partner.India is also considering expanding imports of natural gas, communication equipment, and gold from the US, the Bloomberg report said.But no defence purchases are being planned.“Despite considering a boost in purchases of American goods, the Modi government is unlikely to buy additional defense equipments from the US, a key demand from Trump,” Bloomberg quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying.India has informed the US that it is not keen to buy the F-35 stealth fighter jets, Bloomberg reported. During PM Modi’s visit to the White House in February, Trump had offered to sell the jets to India.

He also mentioned a penalty for India’s purchases of Russian military equipment and energy.""India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the world, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any country,"" Trump said.""Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of energy, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine — All things not good!"" he added.In another post, Trump said: ""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together. Let’s keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words.

Skywatchers are in for a rare celestial spectacle as two meteor showers—the Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids—are set to peak on July 29–30, 2025. With an expected 25 meteors per hour and a moonless sky ensuring perfect visibility, this year’s event promises breathtaking views for both astronomy enthusiasts and casual stargazers. Best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere but visible globally, this dual meteor shower display will deliver stunning streaks of light, fireballs, and long meteor trails. Here’s everything you need to know about the peak timings, origins, and best viewing tips for this remarkable event.The simultaneous peak of two meteor showers, combined with a favourable moon phase, makes 2025 a standout year for meteor enthusiasts. Whether you’re an experienced astronomer or simply love stargazing, this event offers one of the best opportunities to witness natural fireworks lighting up the night sky.The Southern Delta Aquariids, active from July 18 to August 12, will be the primary highlight of this cosmic event. Known for their faint yet persistent trails, these meteors are expected to produce 20 meteors per hour during the peak. Originating from Comet 96P/Machholz, these meteors have been gracing Earth’s skies annually as our planet passes through the comet’s debris field. This year’s activity coincides with a darker moon phase, offering stargazers a clearer, more vivid view of these delicate celestial streaks.Adding variety to the spectacle, the Alpha Capricornids will contribute an additional five to 10 meteors per hour. While fewer in number, this shower is famous for its slow-moving, bright fireballs that often appear colourful and dramatic. These meteors come from Comet 169P/NEAT, which completes its orbit every 4.2 years, leaving behind striking debris trails. Together, they promise a captivating experience for astronomy enthusiasts, photographers, and casual skywatchers eager for a midsummer night’s dazzling natural show.Although visible in both hemispheres, the Southern Hemisphere offers the best vantage point due to the higher elevation of the Aquarius and Capricornus constellations. Northern Hemisphere viewers should look southward during predawn hours for the best chance to witness the showers. A moonless night and minimal light pollution will further enhance visibility, making rural areas ideal for observation.Unlike meteor showers with only a brief peak, the Southern Delta Aquariids provide an extended window of high activity from July 24 to July 31. This means even if weather conditions block the peak night, skywatchers have several opportunities to enjoy the display. Don’t forget to bring a reclining chair, dress warmly, and give your eyes 20–30 minutes to adjust to the dark for the best viewing experience.","The Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids are set to peak on July 29–30, 2025.

Greer’s statement comes days ahead of US President Donald Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline, post which countries face higher tariffs.Since India did not receive any tariff letter from Trump, it is yet unclear whether the 26% tariff rate announced for India on April 2 will kick in from August 1 or not.Trump has additionally warned of implementing ""secondary tariffs"" on countries such as India and China for their Russian oil purchases.Also Read | India-US trade deal: India treads cautiously after Trump’s trade agreements with Japan, others face challenges - here’s what’s happening Although India was one of the initial countries to initiate trade discussions with the White House this year, it has hardened its stance especially on agriculture and dairy sectors.In a CNBC interview on Monday, Greer spoke of the need for further discussions to seal a trade deal.Despite his earlier hints at an imminent agreement with New Delhi, he emphasised that India's traditional stance of market protection meant that any reduction in trade barriers would signify a significant policy shift.""We continue to speak with our Indian counterparts, we've always had very constructive discussions with them,"" Greer said.""They have expressed strong interest in opening portions of their market, we of course are willing to continue talking to them,"" Greer said. ""But I think we need some more negotiations on that with our Indian friends to see how ambitious they want to be,” he said according to the Bloomberg report.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal recently expressed optimism about reaching an agreement to prevent the proposed 26% tariffs. Goyal maintained that the US-India relationship was free from contentious issues, noting that discussions had not included immigration policies, including H-1B visa regulations for skilled workers.Also Read | Donald Trump tariffs: Will the August 1 deadline by extended by US President? What Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Goyal has said that trade deal talks are progressing at a ‘fast pace’ even as he stressed that for any trade agreement India would keep its national interest in mind. He also said that trade deals cannot be worked out on the basis of deadlines.India has shown readiness to eliminate tariffs on specific products including auto parts and pharmaceutical items during trade discussions. However, the country maintains firm restrictions on agricultural and dairy sectors, which it considers non-negotiable in the final agreement.""The thing to understand with India is their trade policy for a very long time has been premised on strongly protecting their domestic market. That's just how they do business"" Greer said.""And the president is in a mode of wanting deals that substantially open other markets, that they open everything or near everything.""","US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said that ""more negotiations"" are required between the two countries.

"Trump's Pak oil deal a move to counter China, pressure India?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-pak-oil-deal-a-move-to-counter-china-pressure-india/articleshow/123027257.cms,"‘Modi Is a Friend But…’:US President Donald Trump after imposing 25% Tariff on India

NEW DELHI : President Donald Trump's announcement of a deal to develop Pakistan's ""massive oil reserves"" sounds more like a strategic manoeuvre on the South Asian chessboard to counter Islamabad's growing dependence on Beijing and pressure India over the trade deal, rather than a realistic assessment of the country's immediate hydrocarbons potential.Various estimates peg Pakistan’s 'proven' reserves of conventional oil at 0.2 billion barrels and natural gas at 529.5 billion cubic meters. These appear modest even when compared to India, which, at last count, was estimated to have oil reserves of about 4.8 billion barrels and natural gas reserves of 1149 billion cubic meters.Pakistan's domestic production, meeting 15-18% of oil and about 60% of gas demand, also has remained modest as exploration efforts yielded incremental discoveries.Claims by leaders in recent times have given rise to speculations over ""mother-of-all"" oil and gas deposits in Sindh and Karachi offshore. All these claims, however, remain unverified in the absence of commercial drilling activities, even as US major Exxon and ENI of Italy have ended surveys.In case deposits are found to be commercially viable, they will take $5-10 billion and 5-7 years to develop. Given the location of the possible deposits, especially in strife-torn Balochistan and areas bordering Iran, it is doubtful whether US companies will be willing to invest such large risk capital in an economy in economic disarray.Trump may be betting on a 2015 US Energy Information Agency study estimating a potential of 9.1 billion barrels of ""technically recoverable"" shale oil and 105 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. This is one area where US shale companies and wildcatters may get interested. But then, technically recoverable is not proven or commercially viable. That leaves many imponderables for explorers.","Trump's announcement of a deal to develop Pakistan's ""massive oil reserves"" sounds more like a strategic manoeuvre to counter Islamabad's growing dependence on Beijing.

US mortgage rate shift: 30-year home loan eases to 6.72% after Fed decision; housing demand stays weak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-mortgage-rate-shift-30-year-home-loan-eases-to-6-72-after-fed-decision-housing-demand-stays-weak/articleshow/123027120.cms,"The average rate on a 30-year fixed US mortgage slipped to 6.72% this week, down slightly from 6.74% a week earlier and matching levels last seen three weeks ago, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Thursday. The minor decline offers limited relief for buyers grappling with high home prices and borrowing costs.A year ago, the 30-year rate was 6.73%. The average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage, often used for refinancing, also fell to 5.85% from 5.87%. These marginal rate changes come as the US housing market remains mired in a prolonged sales slump, dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began rising from pandemic-era lows.Mortgage rates are primarily guided by the 10-year Treasury yield, which fell to 4.34% on Thursday from 4.37% the previous day. Bond yields have been elevated for most of July, as markets anticipated the Federal Reserve would hold rates steady, which it confirmed on Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also dismissed hopes for a rate cut in September, citing persistent inflation and a still-balanced job market.“A September rate cut could push mortgage rates lower at summer’s end, as we saw last year,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.“But if inflation expectations stay elevated, rates could remain stuck above 6%.”The 30-year mortgage rate peaked above 7% in mid-January and briefly dipped to 6.62% in April. Forecasts from Realtor.com and Fannie Mae suggest it may ease to around 6.4% by year-end, still too high to reverse the downturn in housing activity.Pending home sales data point to more weakness ahead. The National Association of Realtors reported a 0.8% decline in June contract signings from May, and a 2.8% drop from a year earlier. The homeownership rate, meanwhile, remains stagnant at 65%—its lowest since 2019.Mortgage applications also declined 3.8% last week to their lowest level since May, despite the recent rate dip. “There is still plenty of uncertainty surrounding the economy and job market, which is weighing on prospective homebuyers’ decisions,” said Joel Kan, deputy chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.","The 30-year fixed US mortgage rate slipped to 6.72% this week, down slightly from 6.74% a week earlier.

These letters make clear: cut the prices, or face the consequences.”This move follows an executive order Trump signed in May to address the high cost of medicines in the US, which are more than three times higher than prices in similarly developed countries, according to the White House.In the letters, Trump criticized pharmaceutical companies for shifting blame and enacting policies that benefit the industry rather than consumers.Central to Trump’s plan is a “Most Favored Nation” policy, which would tie US drug prices to the lowest prices paid by other countries for the same medications. He also wants this pricing to extend to drugs used by Medicaid recipients, primarily older Americans, and to new drugs entering the market.“Americans are demanding lower drug prices and they need them today,” Trump wrote, reinforcing the urgent call for reform.","US President Donald Trump has issued a direct warning to top pharmaceutical companies, demanding they slash drug prices or face action.

Exporters across sectors are worried after US President Donald Trump declared a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods from August 1, along with an unspecified penalty linked to India’s purchases of Russian crude oil and military equipment.The announcement has led to immediate jitters in trade circles, with many buyers from the US holding or cancelling orders as they await more clarity.“I have started receiving communication from my buyers for cancellation of orders. We are a bit worried,” said S C Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) and a hand tool exporter from Ludhiana, as quoted by news agency PTI. He added that the industry is waiting for the US executive order to understand the full scope of the tariff and penalty terms.A major point of concern is the unspecified penalty component. “If it will be imposed in addition to the 25 per cent, then buyers will stop placing orders,” said Arvind Goenka, a plastic product exporter, as per PTI.A leather and footwear exporter also warned that nearly 60 per cent of orders could be cancelled if the tariffs are implemented from August 1. “US buyers are waiting for clarity. It is creating uncertainty,” the exporter said.The US is India’s largest trading partner and accounted for about 18 per cent of total exports in 2024-25. The two-way trade reached $186 billion that year, with India recording a total goods and services trade surplus of $44.4 billion.Exporters argue that India's competitors such as Vietnam and Indonesia currently face lower import duties in the US, 20% and 19%, respectively, giving them a clear pricing advantage. “We will be seriously impacted,” said Chandrima Chatterjee, secretary general of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI). “While most of us have taken the 25 per cent tariff with a pinch of salt, the penalty is where we are extremely concerned”, Chatterjee added.According to Cybex Exim Solutions, Indian textile and garment exporters, who send about $5.6 billion worth of ready-made garments to the US annually, will be among the hardest hit. “The 25 per cent tariff is a big blow. Many exporters might face order cancellations or pressure to reduce prices. Countries like Vietnam and Indonesia now have a pricing edge,” it said.The industry is hopeful that India and the US will soon finalise an interim trade deal to remove or ease the imposed tariff and penalty.Until then, businesses remain in limbo, trying to navigate through cost pressures, buyer hesitations, and trade uncertainty.","US President Donald Trump declared a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods from August 1.

Mexico Rejects Trump Immigration Crackdown Deal; Claudia Sheinbaum Blasts DC's Policies

Sheinbaum confirms 90-day window

US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a 90-day extension for trade negotiations with Mexico, allowing both countries more time to reach a long-term agreement.While tariffs on key Mexican exports remain in place during this period, leaders on both sides expressed optimism about resolving their differences through dialogue.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a “very successful” phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, during which they agreed to continue discussions for another 90 days. The pause would give both governments a chance to work toward “a long-term deal,” he said.Despite the extension, existing tariffs, including a 25% levy on autos and a 50% duty on steel, aluminum, and copper imports, will remain active during the negotiating window. A 25% “Fentanyl Tariff” will also stay in force, Trump said.Trump added that Mexico had “agreed to eliminate its Non-Tariff Trade Barriers,” though he did not provide further details. The US president said he was confident about progress, noting that “we are getting to know and understand each other,” and called the relationship “somewhat different than other nations because of both the problems and assets of the border.”Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed the development, saying the extension had helped avert a tariff escalation for now. “We avoided the tariff increase... and secured 90 days to build a long-term agreement through dialogue,” she said, as reported by AFP.Sheinbaum gave no indication of what concessions Mexico may offer but indicated that both countries were committed to maintaining open channels for talks.The 90-day extension comes amid Trump’s renewed focus on reducing the US trade deficit with Mexico and pressuring the country over fentanyl trafficking. According to the US Census Bureau, the US trade deficit with Mexico was $171.5 billion in 2023, a steep rise from $63.3 billion in 2016.Trump has argued that high tariffs are essential to protect American industries and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing.Until then, businesses in both nations must continue to operate under the current tariff structure, while governments work to settle differences.","US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day extension for trade negotiations with Mexico.

Wall Street rose on Thursday, led by a strong rally in Microsoft and Meta Platforms, as optimism over artificial intelligence and solid earnings pushed major indices toward new record highs. However, concerns over inflation data and President Donald Trump’s shifting tariff policy kept investor sentiment cautious ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8%, heading for a new record, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%, just shy of its all-time high set earlier this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat around 11 a.m. Eastern, AP reported.Meta surged 11.2% after it beat Wall Street’s expectations on both sales and profit, driven by strength in its advertising business and large-scale AI investments. Microsoft jumped 4.4%, following better-than-expected results and a strong performance update on its Azure cloud platform, a cornerstone of its AI roadmap.Apple and Amazon were scheduled to report earnings after market close. Big tech firms have consistently been market drivers this year, riding on investor enthusiasm around generative AI.Outside tech, CVS Health rose 3.3% after raising its full-year forecast post an earnings beat for the second quarter.Markets digested fresh economic data, including a 2.6% rise in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index in June — the Fed’s preferred inflation measure — up from 2.4% in May. The core PCE, which excludes food and energy, also rose 2.8%, marking a potential headwind to rate-cut hopes.Meanwhile, unemployment claims inched up, and new inflation pressures continue to be linked to Trump’s on-and-off tariff decisions. Businesses such as Ford and Hershey have flagged tariff impacts on profitability, adding to corporate unease.Trump’s latest moves include a 50% tariff on Brazil, directly linked to former President Jair Bolsonaro’s trial, and a tariff deal with South Korea. He has threatened similar levies on goods from multiple countries unless agreements are reached by Friday. Unpredictability in trade policy has led to concerns over inflation persistence and Fed inaction.The Fed left interest rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that while inflation is close to the 2% target, persistent upward pressures and tariff-linked uncertainties remain. Markets have since scaled back expectations of a September rate cut — CME Group data now places the odds at 39.2%, down from 58.4% a week ago and 75.4% a month ago.Yields on US government bonds eased slightly, with the 10-year Treasury slipping to 4.34% from 4.37%, and the 2-year note falling to 3.92% from 3.94%.","Nasdaq Composite climbs 0.8%, heading for a new record, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%.

: Irked by India's dogged refusal to conclude a trade deal on his terms, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday taunted New Delhi by weaponising an oil exploration deal with Pakistan, jibing that Islamabad may be selling oil to India someday. At the same time, frustrated by his inability to force Moscow to end its war on Ukraine, he also petulantly unloaded on India for buying oil from Russia, saying ""they can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.""At a White House presser, Trump also publicly identified India's membership of BRICS as another irritant, calling it an anti-American group that was trying to undermine the US dollar even though none of the countries in the covey have suggested as much, and he has concluded opaque or vaguely-defined trade deals with China, Brazil, and South Korea.White House officials indicated that India's refusal to do even a framework agreement before the August 1 deadline had frustrated Trump and triggered the outburst, while acknowledging that negotiations are still in progress.The MAGA supremo's pique over India's stance has been on full display over the past 48 hours as he excoriated a country he still referred to as a ""friend"" while insisting the two sides were continuing talks to conclude a deal, with analysts seeing the tantrum as a pressure tactic aimed at bullying New Delhi.But with hours to go for his self-imposed August 1 deadline to conclude trade deals and India not even offering a fig-leaf of a sketchy agreement that the EU, Japan and other countries have, to assuage him, Trump turned up the heat on New Delhi, jeapordising more than 25 years of rebuilding and uptick in ties after India's 1998 nuclear test.Most jarring was his barb about potential future oil sales to India by Pakistan, a country he not so long ago called a terrorist haven that has given the US ""nothing but lies & deceit."" In a social media post, he announced a US deal with Pakistan. saying the two countries will work together on developing Pakistan's ""massive"" oil reserves, and the US is in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead the Partnership.""Who knows, maybe they'll be selling Oil to India some day!"" he gibed.According to industry estimates, India’s proven reserves are 13–30 times larger than Pakistan’s, depending on the source (4.73–5.85 billion barrels vs. 193–353.5 million barrels). Even at the higher end of Pakistan’s estimates, India’s reserves dwarf them.Pakistan has frequently boasted of large unproven reserves, but industry analysts say these are speculative and require billions of dollars and years of exploration to realize it. India currently produces 1.02 million barrels per day but consumes 4.44 million bpd, while Pakistan produces 88,262 bpd against 556,000 bpd consumption. large unproven reserves, but these are speculative and require $5 billion and 4–5 years for exploration.Aside from his ire about BRICS, oil is the slippery slope that the two sides are sliding down in relation to India's purchase of oil from Russia, whose leader Vladimir Putin was his bestie till recently. ""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,"" Trump raged churlishly. By all accounts, including by US experts, IMF, and World Bank, India's economy is far from dead, and remains one of the fastest growing in the world, clocking 6+ per cent.Despite India being U.S' 9th largest trade partner, with more than $130b in bilateral commerce, Trump also claimed ""We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World.""""Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together. Let’s keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very dangerous territory!"" he wrote, lashing out at a Putin ally who has frequently threatened US with nuclear consequences.Trump's angry burst of recrimination was fueled among others by South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham, long considered a war monger, who said the MAGA Supremo's approach to India ""is the best way to achieve peace in the Russia-Ukraine war, and open up more markets for American goods.""""President Trump is putting a 25% tariff on India plus an unspecified penalty for their trade protectionism and for being one of biggest purchasers of Russian energy, fueling Putin’s war machine. Mr. President, you’re spot in your approach to bringing this war to an end and opening up the world to American products. Tariffs away!"" he wrote.","US President taunted India by weaponising an oil exploration deal with Pakistan, jibing that Islamabad may be selling oil to India someday.

The United States has collected more tariff revenue in the first-half of 2025 than in all of last year, signalling a dramatic rise in income driven by President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy.As per news agency AFP, the US treasury recorded more than $87 billion in tariff revenue through June, surpassing the $79 billion collected in the entirety of 2024.June alone brought in $26.6 billion in tariffs, nearly four times the amount recorded in January.The figures reflect the sharp escalation in duties introduced since Trump returned to office and began dismantling the US’s post-WWII free trade playbook.Trump’s administration has struck several trade deals with other countries that include tariff rates significantly higher than previous levels. However, they remain below the maximum figures that were initially threatened.Starting August 1, new tariff rates of between 11 and 50 per cent are set to take effect for around 80 countries, including the entire European Union. The same day will also see a 50 per cent levy on copper imports come into force.Trump praised the impact of his tariff strategy on social media, claiming it had revived the country’s fortunes. “One year ago, America was a dead country; now it is the ‘hottest’ country anywhere in the world,” he posted on Truth Social. He further declared that the tariffs were making America “great & rich again” as global governments rushed to finalise trade agreements ahead of the deadline.The sharp rise in tariffs is already having a visible impact on prices across the US economy.According to news agency AP, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose to 2.6 per cent in June, up from 2.4 per cent in May. Excluding food and energy, core prices were up 2.8 per cent compared to the same period last year.The Fed, which left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.3 per cent last week, expressed caution about cutting rates too soon. Chair Jerome Powell noted that it could take time to assess whether the price rise is temporary or more persistent.On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices each rose 0.3 per cent. The biggest increases were seen in imported goods: furniture rose by 1.3 per cent, appliances by 1.9 per cent, and computers by 1.4 per cent in June. Meanwhile, gas prices increased by 0.9 per cent and grocery costs by 0.3 per cent.Despite the solid GDP growth of 3 per cent in the second quarter, American consumers remained cautious. Consumer spending rose by just 0.3 per cent from May to June, with inflation-adjusted growth at a marginal 0.1 per cent. The commerce department reported that year-to-date consumer spending has remained sluggish, with only a 1.4 per cent annualised increase in Q2.As per AP, some services saw price drops, such as hotel stays, which fell 3.6 per cent in one month, and airfares, which declined 0.7 per cent. However, the impact of higher import costs on goods continues to dominate inflation trends.The new tariff rates, coming into effect next week, are expected to further shape consumer behaviour and inflation metrics in the months ahead.","The US treasury recorded more than $87 billion in tariff revenue through June, surpassing the $79 billion collected in the entirety of 2024.

The rally propelled its market value past $4 trillion, making it only the second company after Nvidia to reach that milestone.As of 10:09 am ET, Microsoft shares were trading 4.9% up at $538.39.Meanwhile, US markets surged to fresh highs on Thursday, driven by strong tech earnings and continued investor optimism around artificial intelligence, with Microsoft at the forefront of the rally after posting robust quarterly results.The broader market responded in kind. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.3% to 21,396.04, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.8% to 6,413.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3% to reach 44,584.16. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 pushed beyond their previous all-time closing highs, AFP reported.Adding to the momentum, President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with South Korea, introducing a 15% tariff on imports from the country.Markets largely interpreted the deal as a stabilising development, reducing trade uncertainty with a key US economic partner.That helped ease investor concern over inflation data released the same day. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index—the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge—rose 2.6% year-on-year in June, up from 2.4% in May, signalling ongoing pricing pressure.Among other major tech movers, Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook, jumped 12.5% after posting $18.3 billion in quarterly profits, with gains led by a strong advertising business and heightened AI investment.","Microsoft shares climbed up to 8% in early trade after the company reported $27.2 billion in quarterly profits.

U.S. Senate Rejects Attempt To Blocks Arms Sale To Israel Despite Global & Domestic Rebellion

.

Sweden on Thursday urged the European Union to suspend its trade agreement with Israel, citing Israel's actions during the ongoing war in Gaza.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson in a post on X said, ""The situation in Gaza is utterly deplorable, and Israel is not fulfilling its most basic obligations and agreed-upon commitments regarding humanitarian aid. ""He called on EU to freeze the trade component of the association agreement as soon as possible and urged the Israeli government to allow unrestricted humanitarian aid into Gaza.The EU's association agreement with Israel sets the framework for trade and political relations. According to EU statistics, the bloc is Israel’s largest trading partner, accounting for nearly one-third of its total tradeKristersson's remarks follow a similar position taken by the Netherlands earlier this week. Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp stated that the Netherlands would suspend the trade agreement if Israel fails to meet its humanitarian obligations.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has created divisions within the EU. While countries like Germany emphasize Israel's right to self-defense under international law, others, including Spain, have accused Israel of committing acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.A recent EU report presented to 27 member states in late June indicated that Israel may not be fulfilling its human rights commitments under the association agreement.In his statement, Kristersson also stressed the need for more pressure on Hamas, calling for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages. He added that Sweden welcomes growing calls from Middle Eastern countries for Hamas to be disarmed and excluded from Gaza's future governance.","Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson in a post on X said, ""The situation in Gaza is utterly deplorable"" The EU's association agreement with Israel sets the framework for trade and political relations.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

India-US Trade Deal Explained: What The White House Says On Tariffs, Markets And Tech Shifts

Will India stop buying Russian crude?

What are the alternatives to Russian crude for India?

Rising Crude Imports From The US

India’s Crude Import Bill To Be Hit?

Will India stop buying Russian crude oil? US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order revoking the 25% penal tariffs on India for its imports of crude from Russia. However, the executive order clearly says that this 25% penal tariff may be restored if India doesn’t stop buying oil from Russia. With the removal of 25% penalty tariff and the reduction in reciprocal tariff, Indian exports to the US will now face a duty of 18%.A key element of the understanding, according to Trump, is India’s commitment to stop both direct and indirect imports of Russian crude oil, a move Washington considers essential to increasing economic pressure on Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine. While the executive order says that India has committed to ending direct or indirect imports of Russian oil, New Delhi has reiterated that safeguarding the energy needs and security of its 1.4 billion citizens remains its foremost priority.During much of 2024 and 2025, India was one of the largest purchasers of discounted Russian oil, with imports of over two million barrels per day at their peak.Government sources, referring to a recent Ministry of External Affairs statement, told TOI that India’s strategy centres on diversifying energy supplies in line with market conditions and evolving global developments, and that all decisions are guided by this objective.According to a PTI report, while Indian refiners have not yet received any formal instructions to halt Russian crude imports, they have been informally advised to begin scaling back purchases. Refiners are expected to honour existing contracts, typically placed six to eight weeks in advance, but refrain from placing fresh orders after that.Also Read | 18% tariffs, boost to exports, agriculture protected: How India benefits from trade deal with US? Explained Experts believe that while Russian crude may drop in the coming months, the chances of it completely disappearing from India’s crude basket appear slim.Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst, Refining and Modeling at Kpler sees no immediate reduction since contracts are already in place.""Russian volumes remain largely locked in for the next 8-10 weeks and continue to be economically critical for India's complex refining system, supported by deep discounts on Urals relative to Brent. Imports are expected to stay broadly stable in the 1.1-1.3 million barrels a day range through Q1 and early Q2,"" he said.""Despite a recent moderation in purchases, India is unlikely to fully disengage in the near term.""Sourav Mitra, Partner, Oil and Gas, Grant Thornton Bharat told TOI, “India has always maintained that it will continue to prioritize the energy security of its 1.4 billion citizens. India reaffirmed this position recently in response to the claims by the United States that India will stop purchasing Russian crude oil while announcing the broader contours of the trade deal with India. India has strategically diversified its crude oil import basket and will continue to stay the course. ”“The oil flow from Russia to India is unlikely to vanish completely anytime soon as these strategic decisions are based on existing contractual obligations, prices offered, supply chain reorientation, and refining capabilities/ margins of refiners. Though Russia’s share in India’s imports has fallen off the peak of ~40%, it still tops the list, and any scale back is expected to be more gradual,” he added.Before India ramped up its crude oil import from Russia, the West Asian suppliers dominated the supply with Russia contributing in lower single digits. India has diversified its sources of supply to about 40 countries with more supply coming onto the market from Guyana, Brazil and Canada.Kpler’s Ritolia emphasises that crude sourcing diversification is expected to continue, with incremental volumes likely to come from the Middle East and the US as India broadens its supplier base while maintaining flexibility across origins.According to Sourav Mitra of Grant Thornton Bharat, in a remote eventuality of Russian oil imports ceasing completely, the import basket may reorient towards Middle East-based suppliers; led by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and UAE. The US is already one of the top 5 exporters of crude oil to India. India can look to augment the oil purchase from the US depending on the prices offered, he says.African suppliers can be potential alternatives to backfill the gap. Their crude is sweeter and more suitable to Indian refiners. India has already seen an increase from oil imports from African countries such as Nigeria, Angola, Egypt, Libya in FY26 as Russian oil imports reduce.“India can opportunistically look at the Venezuelan oil, but the volumes can be constrained by pricing considerations and limited capacity of Indian refiners to process the Venezuelan oil. Venezuela’s crude oil is heavy and sour grade which requires hydro processing, consequently squeezing the refining margins,” Mitra adds.Russia’s share in India’s crude imports fell to 33.7% during the April–November 2025 period, compared with 37.9% in the corresponding months of 2024. Over the same timeframe, the United States’ share increased to 8.1% from 4.6%.Kpler estimates indicate that Russian crude imports declined from 1.8 million barrels per day in November to 1.2 million barrels per day in December, and further to 1.16 million barrels per day in January 2026.The US has said that India plans to acquire American energy products, technology goods and agricultural commodities worth $500 billion over the next five years. These are expected to include crude oil, liquefied natural gas, aircraft and related components, advanced technologies such as graphics processing units, and farm products.According to the Grant Thornton expert, this signals that India will likely ramp up crude oil purchase from the US which may be a mix of crude oil, LNG, coking coal among others. “India’s purchase from the US is already on an upward trend, with the US now constituting around 8% of India’s total oil purchase. However, the scale of oil purchase from the US would largely depend on the commercial considerations,” he says.Also Read | India-US trade deal: Which Indian goods will face zero tariffs in America? Piyush Goyal lists out India’s crude oil import is 4.5-5 million bpd. Russian oil imports hit a peak of ~2 million bpd in June 2025, which has come down to about 1.1 million bpd in January 2026.Sourav Mitra of Grant Thornton Bharat notes that if the Russian oil purchase were to cease entirely, the adverse impact on India’s crude oil import bill could be anywhere between 1-2%.“This impact can be set off by ramping up oil purchase from Venezuela though. However, this reorientation has its own challenges. India’s decision to buy oil from Venezuela will primarily depend on the discounts offered. The Venezuelan oil should come at a discount of $10-14/barrel vis-à-vis Brent to outweigh the additional costs stemming from freight, insurance, and higher processing by the Indian refiners,” he tells TOI.As SBI Research notes in a new report this month: India turned to purchasing Russian oil sold at a discount (capped: $60 per barrel), to ensure its energy security, after Western countries-imposed sanctions on Moscow and shunned its supplies over its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Consequently, Russia’s share has increased to 35.1% in FY25 and it is now the biggest oil importer for India.“The substitution of Russian crude by Merey 16 has clear positives for the domestic economy as private and PSU oil refineries can exploit the heavy crude discount. Heavy crude discounts in range $10-12 can make good the Russian discount, ensuring commercial viability. This implies the trade deal will not affect the domestic inflation after sacrificing the Russian discount. India’s fuel import bill could even decline by $3 billion in the event of shifting to Venezuela. The discount of $10-12 could make the choice agnostic,” says SBI.However, Mitra warns that what may complicate the math is the fact that if India stops buying the Russian crude oil, it will tighten the global crude market due to its sheer volumes.“Where the crude oil prices stabilize will primarily depend on where the additional Urals go and how easy it is for the Venezuelan oil to find buyers,” he says.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order revoking the 25% penal tariffs on India for its imports of crude from Russia. With the removal of 25% penalty tariff and the reduction in reciprocal tariff, Indian exports to the US will now face a duty of 18%. A key element of the understanding, according to Trump, is India’s commitment to stop both direct and indirect imports of Russian oil.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128071409,imgsize-49438,width-400,resizemode-4/india-crude-oil-imports.jpg"

The benchmark index went through a truly high-voltage week, with Nifty navigating an exceptionally volatile environment. The index oscillated within a massive 1,662-point range—its widest weekly swing since June 2024—highlighting the heightened uncertainty gripping the market.Volatility peaked on Union Budget day, when Nifty slipped sharply to an intraday low of 24,571 amid concerns over the proposed increase in STT on F&O transactions. However, the sell-off proved fleeting. A powerful 1,770-point rebound followed as global risk sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump announced an immediate cut in reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods from 25% to 18%. This global trigger propelled the index to an intraday high of 26,341, reigniting hopes of a fresh all-time high.That optimism, however, failed to sustain. Within the very first minute of trade, Nifty witnessed a sharp 600-point intraday cut, indicating aggressive profit-booking at higher levels. Despite supportive global cues, the index struggled to decisively scale new highs, underscoring the fragile and nervous market sentiment.As the week progressed, Nifty slipped into a phase of sideways consolidation. Heavy selling pressure in IT stocks capped broader market upside, as rising concerns around recent developments in artificial intelligence sparked apprehensions about the sector’s long-term growth outlook.As a result, the Nifty IT index emerged as the worst-performing sector, ending the week with a sharp decline of 6.91%.From a technical standpoint, momentum indicators continue to signal consolidation, suggesting that the index may remain range-bound before a decisive directional move unfolds.Looking ahead, the 100-day EMA zone of 25,500–25,550 is expected to act as immediate support, followed by the 25,200 level. On the upside, the 25,850–25,880 band remains a critical resistance area. A sustained move above 25,880 could pave the way for further upside toward 26,000, followed by 26,200 in the near term—potentially setting the stage for another attempt at higher levels.The banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, scaled a fresh all-time high of 61,764 on Tuesday, underscoring the continued strength in the financial space. However, the index struggled to sustain higher levels, as sharp profit-booking emerged in the latter half of the week. Despite the pullback, Bank Nifty closed the week on a firm footing at 60,120, registering nearly 3% weekly gains. On the weekly chart, the index formed a bullish candle with a long upper shadow, reflecting elevated intraday volatility and persistent selling pressure near higher zones.From a trend perspective, Bank Nifty continues to trade comfortably above all its key moving averages, reinforcing the resilience of the medium-term uptrend. That said, momentum indicators and oscillators have begun to flatten, suggesting a phase of consolidation or sideways movement as the market digests recent gains and awaits fresh triggers.Looking ahead, the 20-day EMA zone of 59,600–59,500 is expected to act as the immediate and most crucial support area. Holding above this zone will be vital to preserve the prevailing bullish structure. On the upside, the 60,400–60,500 band remains a strong supply zone. A decisive and sustained breakout above 60,500 could revive bullish momentum, opening the door for a swift rally toward 61,200, with the potential to extend further toward 62,000 in the short term.BAJFINANCE has given a decisive breakout above the 942–976 consolidation range seen over the last three sessions, supported by a sharp spike in volumes, adding credibility to the move. RSI has climbed strongly from 32 to 58, reflecting improving momentum. On the ADX indicator, DI+ has crossed above DI-, indicating strengthening trend direction. Rising green MACD histogram bars further confirm bullish momentum pickup. Overall price action and indicators suggest the stock is likely to see continued upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 985-980 with a stoploss of 955. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 1050 in the short term.LT has staged a strong rebound from its 200-day EMA on the daily chart, signalling a shift in trend. RSI has recovered sharply from an oversold level of 24 to 59, indicating strengthening bullish momentum. Rising MACD histogram bars further support the positive bias. The Infra index has moved from the improving to the leading quadrant on the Relative Rotational Graph (RRG), highlighting improving sector-wide strength and momentum, with LT leading the move. Strong price action and sectoral momentum suggest the stock is well placed to extend its uptrend. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 4075-4065 with a stoploss of 3945. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 4355 in the short term.","Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, says top stock picks for the week are Bajaj Finance and Larsen & Toubro.

Gold and silver price prediction: Gold and silver prices have resumed their upward momentum after the recent crash, signalling bullish momentum, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group. He shares his views on gold and silver:MCX Gold on the weekly timeframe has undergone a correction from its all-time high of 180,779. However, prices have found support at the rising trendline and have rebounded, indicating a resumption of the bullish trend. The recent acceleration reinforces the strength and sustainability of the move, and the broader outlook remains positive as long as prices hold above the weekly low.From a weekly standpoint, the 147,000 region stands out as a crucial support, aligned with the 30-days exponential moving average. Any pullback toward this zone is expected to draw fresh buying interest, helping to limit downside risk in the near term. Sustaining above this level keeps the bullish structure intact and supports ongoing positive momentum.Gold looks well positioned to move toward the 175,000 mark in the coming sessions, and a decisive close above this level would validate the bullish bias for subsequent periods.This potential upside aligns with the broader uptrend and highlights the strength of prevailing momentum. Moreover, the formation of higher highs and higher lows over the week further supports positive sentiment and points to the likelihood of a sustained upward move.Overall, gold continues to exhibit a positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly supporting trend continuation. As long as prices stay comfortably above the key 147,000 support level, the bullish setup remains valid. Backed by strong momentum indicators and a supportive market sentiment environment, the metal appears well placed to carry its upward move forward in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has seen a healthy pullback from its all-time high of 420,048 and has since rebounded from recent lows, signalling a resumption of the bullish trend. With the underlying trend still positive, any ongoing dips may be viewed as buying opportunities as long as the latest weekly low holds. We advise aligning positions with the prevailing uptrend, while maintaining a controlled stop-loss at the recent weekly lows.Silver’s rally at the start of the week signals a renewed bullish trend and strengthens the outlook for further upside. As long as prices remain above the weekly support levels, the positive bias is expected to persist. Immediate key support is seen around the 245,000 zone, and a close below this level could weaken the bullish outlook. Until then, any pullback is likely to attract fresh buying interest, sustaining upward momentum.On the upside, silver appears well positioned to test the 330,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This prospective move points to a continuation of the prevailing bullish phase, backed by strong momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, provided prices remain firmly above the 245,000 support level, silver is expected to sustain its uptrend, with ample scope for further appreciation as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Gold and silver prices have resumed their upward momentum after the recent crash, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened in green on Monday, rallying strongly on the back of India-US trade deal joint statement issued over the weekend, and US President Donald Trump’s executive order revoking 25% penal tariffs. While Nifty50 went above 25,800, BSE Sensex was up over 500 points in opening trade. At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,819.00, up 125 points or 0.49%. BSE Sensex was at 83,994.31, up 414 points or 0.50%.Market analysts are of the view that the stock market could remain range-bound in the near term with stock-specific movements driven by earnings outcomes amid persistent global uncertainties.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “There are tailwinds that can take the market higher in the near-term. Clarity on the US-India trade deal indicates that the Indian businesses, particularly exporters, will benefit. More importantly, the uncertainty over the trade deal and its impact on the Indian economy, which was weighing on the market, has been removed. The rebound in the US market and the cues from other markets indicate another phase of risk on.A big positive for the market is that FIIs who were sustained sellers in the market have bought in the cash market in three out of the last four trading days.The fact that the derivatives market continues to be heavily net short might impart resilience to the market, on expectations of short covering.

Announced against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, the Union Budget 2026–27 carried expectations of reinforcing India’s global standing—especially in light of recently concluded Foreign Trade Agreements. The Budget 2026 continues to advance India’s long‑term strategic narrative: strengthening manufacturing as the core engine of growth while simultaneously expanding the country’s capabilities in services and digital trade.The Finance Minister reaffirmed the centrality of manufacturing to India’s economic strategy. Large‑scale investments in textiles, semiconductors, rare‑earth mining, infrastructure, and MSME development signal the Government’s intent to build resilient, future‑ready industrial capacity. These interventions align strongly with India’s aspiration to emerge as a global manufacturing hub.Complementing manufacturing, the Budget underscores the Sankalp for accelerating and sustaining economic growth, fulfilling citizen aspirations, and advancing the vision ofwithin the framework of the three. This focus manifests in initiatives aimed at strengthening the services ecosystem and positioning India deeper within global value chains.Several targeted interventions demonstrate this intent. In a major relief to the IT sector, the Government has introduced several tax reforms, including but not limited to consolidating services under a single category of IT Services with a common safe‑harbour margin of 15.5 percent, increasing the safe-harbour threshold from ₹300 crore to ₹2,000 crore to ease compliance for large taxpayers, and introducing tax holidays until 2047 for foreign companies offering cloud services through India‑based data centres, with a 15 percent safe‑harbour for related entities providing supporting data‑center operations. These key reforms would aid in creating long‑term policy predictability and reinforce India’s digital infrastructure competitiveness.As regards providing a push to the creative industries, establishment of AVGC Content Creator Lab in schools and colleges is likely to accelerate skill development in animation, gaming, VFX, and digital content creation industries which are already experiencing exponential global demand.In terms of alleviating the tourism and hospitality needs of India, a National Institute of Hospitality is proposed which would integrate academia, industry, and the Government. This move is expected to uplift service standards, aligning India’s hospitality workforce with global benchmarks, scale up India’s tourism offerings, boost employment, and enhance economic contribution from both domestic and international tourism.With education and healthcare forming the backbone of any resilient economy, the Budget’s initiatives—such as the creation of a High‑Powered “Education to Employment and Enterprise” Standing Committee and the upgrading of existing institutions alongside the establishment of new centres for training Allied Health Professionals—represent critical forward‑looking interventions. These measures are expected to significantly narrow the skill gap by aligning academic curricula with evolving industry needs, ensuring that learners acquire job‑ready competencies. Together, they will not only enhance employability but also strengthen the quality and preparedness of India’s future workforce, positioning the country to meet the growing demands of a rapidly transforming economic landscape.On a separate note, the Budget lays out a forward‑looking roadmap for strengthening maritime and inland logistics. The introduction of new Dedicated Freight Corridors connecting the East and the West, along with 20 new National Waterways to improve connectivity between mineral belts, industrial hubs, and ports, signals a major push toward integrated transport infrastructure. The proposed development of a ship‑repair ecosystem for inland waterways and the launch of the Coastal Cargo Promotion Scheme—aimed at doubling the share of coastal and inland waterway cargo by 2047 - further demonstrates the Government’s commitment to modernizing multimodal logistics.Reflecting a clear shift from policing to facilitating trade, the Budget introduces a series of trust‑based governance measures aimed at enhancing efficiency, predictability, and transparency within customs processes.Key reforms include the extension of the duty‑deferral period for Tier 2 and Tier 3 AEOs from the current 15 days to 30 days, providing businesses with improved cash‑flow flexibility and reduced working‑capital strain. Additionally, the validity of binding advance rulings has been increased from 3 to 5 years, offering greater certainty to importers and exporters in planning their tax positions. The Government has also proposed recognizing regular, compliant importers within customs risk‑assessment systems, thereby reducing repetitive verification and enabling faster cargo clearance for trusted entities in addition to streamlining the overall Customs Integrated System.While the journey toward fully meeting expectations on Customs simplification has only begun, the initiatives announced in the Budget mark a clear and progressive shift toward enhancing ease of doing business and improving predictability across trade processes. These reforms reinforce the Government’s intent to build a more efficient, trust‑based regulatory environment for importers and exporters alike.It is also noteworthy that the Budget continues to advance India’s agenda of becoming a more attractive investment destination. Key measures include permitting Persons Resident Outside India (PROIs) to invest in listed Indian equities through the Portfolio Investment Scheme, rationalizing TDS/TCS rates to reduce compliance burden, and decriminalizing procedural lapses such as non‑production of books of account or delays in tax deduction payments. Collectively, these steps strengthen investor confidence, improve regulatory clarity, and align with India’s broader objective of fostering a transparent, growth‑oriented business ecosystem under the broader vision ofOverall, the Budget 2026–27 has been delivered with clarity, balance, and a long‑term vision. It successfully addresses expectations across sectors—strengthening manufacturing, deepening services capability, modernizing logistics, and promoting trust‑based governance. This year’s Budget, in many ways, sets the tone for India’s next phase of economic transformation.","The Budget 2026 continues to advance India’s long‑term strategic narrative: strengthening manufacturing as the core engine of growth.

Mrs. Bectors Food Specialities, the makers of Cremica and English Oven brands of biscuits, exports biscuits and cookies worth around Rs 100 crore to American retailers and had to take a hit of around 5-7% by offering discount to offset the impact of tariffs.While the US is going to offer duty-free access to some Indian bakery products, Bector is waiting for the list.Tea growers too are celebrating duty-free access, more so because of the tariff advantage compared to competitors from Sri Lanka, Kenya and China. Sri Lanka was hit due to their 'tea-for-oil' barter deal with Iran, resulting in a 25% tariff penalty. Kenya, which enjoyed duty-free access under AGOA, now has to contend with 10% baseline reciprocal tariff.""The 'Golden Letter' exemption restores the price competitiveness of Indian Orthodox and specialty teas against rivals like Kenya and Sri Lanka. By securing zero-duty access, while Sri Lanka is trapped at 25% and Kenya at 10%, India has effectively become the lowest-cost premium producer for the North American market. Furthermore, with Chinese tea facing even steeper tariffs of 33-35%, India has a historic window. While we currently produce lower volumes of green and oolong teas, this tariff advantage provides the perfect incentive for Indian estates to diversify and become the lead specialty supplier to the US,"" said Ajay Jalan, MD of Mokalbari Kanoi Tea Estate.A lot of exporters will get clarity when American buyers return to offices on Monday, especially those which were offering steep discounts and have goods in transit.Texport Industries CMD Narendra Goenka wants to know the fate of discounts on goods in transit or ones that are ready to be dispatched.

""With tension in Iran rising, some of the buyers were getting even more anxious but we somehow managed to hold on to most of them, although we did lose some order, which we will have to work on,"" said Goenka. Most textiles players have taken a hit on their bottom lines due to the hefty discount so that they could retain buyers and did not have to retrench too many workers.""This will be the first time in several years that the balance sheet will show a loss.

Even during the Wednesday layoffs, his absence and subsequent appearance at a Super Bowl event in San Francisco reportedly caused anger.The Washington Post announced what it called a “significant restructuring” of its operations, including the closure of its standalone Sports desk and a reduction in its international reporting presence. According to Fox News, roughly a third of the organisation’s workforce which is nearly 300 employees were affected.Bezos broke his silence since the layoffs, stating in a statement that ""The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity.""

Here is what Trump claimed and how far were they from facts

""Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST” country anywhere in the world!""

US was not dead when he returned to the Oval office for his second stint for POTUS. Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

In 2024, the last year of the Biden presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023.

presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023. Meanwhile, first three quarters show that Trump’s tariffs - or even the threat of them - produced mixed outcomes. However, Full-year data for 2025 is not yet available.

From January to March, US GDP contracted for the first time in three years. The reason was clear: imports surged as American companies rushed to stock up on foreign goods ahead of potential tariff hikes. Since imports are subtracted from GDP, the spike dragged growth into negative territory.

The slowdown proved temporary. Growth rebounded sharply in the second quarter, with the economy expanding at an annualised rate of 3.8% from April to June. Momentum strengthened further in the third quarter, when growth accelerated to 4.4%. The rebound was driven in part by a decline in imports, reflecting both the impact of tariffs and earlier stockpiling. Strong consumer spending also played a major role.

Trump has also pointed to gains in the US stock market, noting that stocks hit record highs 52 times in 2025. While the market did post solid gains, its performance lagged several global peers.

“Annual core inflation for the past three months has dropped to just 1.4% - far lower than almost anyone, other than me, had predicted.”

According to news agency AP, Trump is using cherry-picked data to vastly exaggerate where inflation stands. Trump’s preferred inflation figure - annual inflation over the past three months excluding food and energy - is low. But it is also distorted. A government shutdown in October and November disrupted data collection, forcing the statistical agency to rely on rough estimates in some categories, which artificially pushed overall inflation lower.

Core inflation over the final six months of 2025 stood at 2.6%. That is lower than January 2025 levels but roughly in line with October 2024. Overall inflation has largely plateaued this year. It was running at 3% in September, before the shutdown - the same level as in January 2025.

It is true that inflation did not spike as sharply as many economists feared when Trump began rolling out tariffs last spring. But that is partly because many of the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were later withdrawn, scaled back or riddled with exemptions.

The impact of tariffs is clearer in core goods prices, which also exclude food and energy. Before the pandemic, core goods prices typically rose little or even fell year after year. By last December, however, they were 1.4% higher than a year earlier - the biggest increase outside the pandemic since 2011.

“The data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen… paying at least 80% of tariff costs.”

The study Trump cited appears to show the opposite. Co-authored by Cavallo, it finds that US consumers bore about 43% of the tariff-related costs after seven months, with most of the remainder absorbed by US firms.

Cavallo said import prices barely declined, suggesting foreign exporters did not cut prices enough to shoulder most of the burden.

“We have slashed our monthly trade deficit by an astonishing 77%.”

This figure also relies on cherry-picking - comparing an unusually large deficit in January 2025, when Trump took office, with an unusually small one in October. The broader trend is less flattering.

From January through November 2025, the US ran a trade deficit of nearly $840 billion, about 4% higher than during the same period in 2024.

Imports surged in the first three months of the year as companies rushed to buy foreign goods ahead of tariffs.

While monthly deficits fell later in the year, the early import spike was so large that the year-to-date deficit still exceeds last year’s.

""I have successfully used tariffs to secure colossal investments in America… more than $18 trillion.”

Trump did use tariff threats to extract investment pledges from trading partners. The European Union alone promised $600 billion over four years.

But the administration has not explained how it arrived at the $18 trillion figure.

The White House has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE.

has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE. They also caution that many pledges are vague and may never fully materialise, in part because some countries would struggle to finance them.

The numbers are large by any measure. Total private investment in the US currently runs at about $5.4 trillion annually. In 2024, foreign direct investment - money put into factories, offices and other physical assets - totaled just $151 billion.

US President Donald Trump has, at several occasions, claimed that broad tariffs on different countries has revived the American economy. In his recent opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Trump claimed that tariffs have created an ""American economic miracle. ""He also lamented on critics and economists who predicted that tariffs would backfire, raising prices and threatening growth.""When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,"" US president wrote.""Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!"" he added.However, it appears the US president is playing fast and loose with his claims, which are often not supported by facts.","Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall. American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. Trump has also pointed to gains in the US stock market, noting that stocks hit record highs 52 times in 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128000302,imgsize-659548,width-400,resizemode-4/128000302.jpg"

Iran’s IRGC ‘CAPTURE’ Two Foreign Oil Tankers, Send Message To Trump Ahead Of Iran-US Nuke Talks

The United States on Friday announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade, hours after indirect talks between Tehran and Washington concluded in Oman.The move came even as both sides signalled willingness to continue negotiations aimed at easing tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme.The sanctions, unveiled by the US State Department, target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s “shadow fleet,” which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions, according to Reuters.In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said that the measures were part of the Trump administration’s renewed pressure campaign against Tehran.“President Donald Trump is committed to driving down the Iranian regime's illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration's maximum pressure campaign,” Pigott said.The United States said that the fresh sanctions were aimed at cutting off revenue streams that Tehran uses to fund repression at home and destabilising activities abroad.Pigott accused Tehran of prioritising repression and regional destabilisation over domestic welfare.“Instead of investing in the welfare of its own people and crumbling infrastructure, the Iranian regime continues to fund destabilizing activities around the world and step up its repression inside Iran,” he said.Warning of continued pressure, he added: “So long as Iranian regime attempts to evade sanctions and generate oil and petrochemical revenues to fund such oppressive behavior and support terrorist activities and proxies, the United States will act to hold both the Iranian regime and its partners accountable.”Among the entities sanctioned by the United States is an India-based firm involved in managing a vessel accused of transporting Iranian petroleum products in violation of international restrictions.According to the US State Department, Elevate Marine Management Private Limited (ELEVATE), an Indian commercial shipping management company, served as the commercial manager of the BENEDICT, a Cameroon-flagged crude oil tanker. The vessel is alleged to have transported Iranian petroleum products on at least three occasions between September and November 2025.Akash Anant Shinde is an Indian national and director of Elevate Marine Management Private Limited.The announcement came shortly after Iranian and US officials wrapped up a day of indirect negotiations in Muscat, mediated by Oman. The talks were described as constructive by TehranIran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking after the talks, struck a cautiously optimistic tone, calling the discussions “a good start.”“If we can go along with this positive path, I can say that we can reach a positive framework regarding the nuclear talks between Iran and the US,” Araghchi told reporters.He said both sides had agreed to continue discussions after further consultations in their respective capitals.“Our concerns were conveyed, as well as our interests and the rights that the Iranian people have. It was conveyed in a very good atmosphere, and the views of the other side were also heard,” he added.According to Oman’s foreign ministry, foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi met separately with Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in Muscat.Footage later released by Oman’s state news agency showed US Navy Admiral Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command also present.The negotiations mark the first formal engagement since the United States joined Israel’s military action against Iran in June, during which US strikes damaged Iranian nuclear facilities.Israel also targeted Iran’s air defence systems and ballistic missile infrastructure. Since then, Washington has bolstered its military presence in the region, deploying additional warships, fighter jets and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.US officials have indicated that Washington wants the talks to go beyond Iran’s nuclear programme to include its missile capabilities and regional influence. Iran, however, has insisted that discussions remain limited.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations earlier this week, saying, “I’m not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we’re going to try to find out.”Tensions remain high as both sides weigh diplomacy against the risk of escalation. The US has recently shot down an Iranian drone near the USS Abraham Lincoln, while Iran has attempted to stop a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz.Friday’s sanctions also follow similar measures imposed last month, when the US targeted vessels accused of moving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil.The Treasury Department has said that Iran’s shadow fleet plays a critical role in financing the regime, including its domestic crackdowns and regional activities.","The sanctions target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s ‘shadow fleet,’ which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions.

AI spending worries hit Amazon

Bitcoin stabilises, crypto stocks jump

Consumers, airlines and smaller stocks gain

US stock markets moved higher on Friday, clawing back part of the heavy losses seen earlier in the week, as technology shares recovered and bitcoin halted its recent slide.The rebound came after several volatile sessions driven by worries over massive spending on artificial intelligence and its impact on corporate profits.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 776 points, or 1.6 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent by mid-morning trading in New York.Chipmakers led the recovery. Nvidia climbed 4.9 per cent, trimming a weekly decline of more than 10 per cent, while Broadcom gained 3.8 per cent after falling sharply earlier in the week.According to news agency AP, hopes of strong long-term demand for chips linked to artificial intelligence continued to support the sector.Despite the broader rebound, concerns over soaring AI investment remained. Amazon shares slumped 8.5 per cent after the company said it expects to spend around $200 billion this year on areas such as AI, chips, robotics and low-earth-orbit satellites.Similar spending plans announced earlier by Alphabet have raised questions about whether such large investments will deliver enough future profits.As per news agency AFP, investors have grown cautious after a period when enthusiasm around AI lifted much of the technology sector.Chris Low of FHN Financial said markets were now reassessing whether the sell-off had gone too far, noting that traders felt some of the recent declines may have been “overdone”.Even with Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 was still on course for its third weekly fall in four weeks.Bitcoin showed signs of stabilising after weeks of losses that wiped out more than half its value since its October peak.The cryptocurrency recovered to around $68,000 after briefly slipping near $60,000 late on Thursday.The move helped lift shares linked to the crypto sector. Robinhood Markets surged 11.7 per cent, Coinbase Global rose 7.3 per cent, and Strategy, a company known for holding large amounts of bitcoin, jumped 15.9 per cent.US consumer sentiment also provided some support. A preliminary survey from the University of Michigan showed sentiment improving slightly, defying expectations of a fall. The improvement was strongest among households that own shares.Airline stocks gained on hopes that stronger confidence would translate into more travel spending. United Airlines rose 5.4 per cent, American Airlines gained 4.6 per cent, and Delta Air Lines added 4.4 per cent.Smaller companies outperformed larger peers, with the Russell 2000 index climbing 2.3 per cent. These firms tend to be more sensitive to the strength of the US economy.In the bond market, US Treasury yields were largely steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at around 4.21 per cent, unchanged from late Thursday.","The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions.

German exports to the United States plunged last year due to President Donald Trump's tariff blitz, and the trade surplus of Europe's top economy with the US shrunk to a four-year low, data showed Friday.But total exports for 2025 rebounded by around one percent following two years of contraction, as stronger trade with Europe offset falling shipments to the United States, statistics agency Destatis said.German exports to the United States fell 9.3 percent last year, while US imports to Germany rose slightly.Germany's trade surplus with the world's biggest economy was 52.2 billion euros ($62 billion), its lowest level since 2021, after a record surplus the previous year of nearly 70 billion euros.China returned as Germany's biggest trading partner last year, overtaking the US, as exports from the world's number two economy to Germany rose sharply, according to the preliminary data.Europe was in Trump's crosshairs when he launched his tariff onslaught as it runs a hefty trade surplus with the United States, much of it due to German exports.Under a deal struck in July, EU exports to the United States face a baseline levy of 15 percent -- far higher than before Trump's return to office.It was a heavy blow for Germany, whose firms, from well-known automakers and machinery giants to smaller, family-owned companies, have long relied on robust trade with the United States.","German exports to the United States fell 9.3 percent last year, while US imports to Germany rose slightly.

Bitcoin wipes out gains since Trump’s election

Broader digital asset holdings also hit

Fed concerns and investor outflows

Tech sector weakness piles pressure on crypto segment

Cryptogiant Bitcoin has suffered sharp losses since the beginning of 2026, tumbling over 20%. The digital currency has given up almost half of its value since October’s record peak of over $124,000, sliding to $67,000, now worth less than it was at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term. Bitcoin is often pitched as “digital gold” as its returns are just like gold, offering no dividends or profits and price driven by what investors are willing to pay. The world’s largest cryptocurrency was last trading 1.64% higher at $64,153.24 after a volatile session that saw prices swing between gains and losses, having earlier touched a low of $60,008.52.The global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since peaking at $4.379 trillion in early October, with $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone, Reuters reported. Bitcoin has declined 28% so far this year, while ether has lost nearly 38% over the same period.As the asset slid, shares of companies holding bitcoin and other digital assets also came under heavy pressure amid ongoing turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, fuelling concerns about stress across the sector. Publicly listed firms that piled into crypto last year, encouraged by US President Donald Trump’s supportive stance, are now grappling with intensifying market challenges.The decline comes as uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate cuts and concerns over AI company valuations weigh on risk assets, pushing bitcoin to its lowest level since November 2024.MicroStrategy’s bitcoin-focused arm, Strategy, has seen shares tumble from $457 in July to $111.27 on Thursday, marking their lowest level since August 2024. The stock was last down more than 11%, according to Reuters.In December, Strategy cut its 2025 earnings forecast, citing weak bitcoin performance, and announced plans to create a reserve to support dividend payments. The company now expects full-year earnings between a $6.3 billion profit and a $5.5 billion loss, down from its earlier forecast of $24 billion.Other notable bitcoin buyers have also been hit. UK-based Smarter Web Company (SWC.L) fell nearly 18%, Nakamoto Inc (NAKA.O) lost almost 9%, and Japan’s Metaplanet (3350.T) dropped over 7%.Bitcoin itself is down nearly 28% since the start of the year, with recent selling accelerating after Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Analysts cited by Reuters say that Warsh’s appointment could lead to a smaller Fed balance sheet, a negative for speculative assets like crypto.Bitcoin has erased all gains made since Trump’s election, when he pledged to overhaul policies toward digital assets.

""If previous cycles are anything to go by, this is no longer a short-term correction, but rather a transition... and these typically take months, not weeks,"" Reuters cited the expert.Companies holding other tokens have been affected as well. Alt5 Sigma, which stocks the Trump family’s WLFI token, fell 8.4%. SharpLink Gaming, holding ether, dropped 8%, while Forward Industries, which holds solana, fell nearly 6%.Bitcoin fell to a low of $63,295.74 on Thursday, its weakest since October 2024, before rebounding slightly to $63,525, marking its largest one-day drop since November 2022. Approximately $1 billion in bitcoin positions were liquidated over 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.Trump’s Fed pick, Kevin Warsh, has added to market fears. Analysts say investors worry that a smaller balance sheet will remove liquidity support for speculative assets.""The market fears a hawk with him,"" Manuel Villegas Franceschi from Julius Baer told Reuters. ""A smaller balance sheet is not going to provide any tailwinds for crypto.""Deutsche Bank analysts highlighted massive outflows from institutional ETFs as a key driver of the decline.US spot bitcoin ETFs saw over $3 billion withdrawn in January, following $2 billion and $7 billion outflows in December and November, respectively. ""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" they said.The slide in cryptocurrencies has been compounded by a broader downturn in tech stocks, particularly software companies linked to AI. Bitcoin and other tokens have historically tracked risk appetite in technology markets, and the current weakness has intensified losses.""Concerns are being raised around the crypto miners and whether we could be looking at forced liquidations if prices continue to fall, which could lead to a vicious cycle,"" said Jefferies strategist Mohit Kumar, as cited by Reuters.

US job vacancies declined to their lowest level in more than five years in December, underscoring persistent softness in the labour market despite strong economic growth, according to AP.Data released by the US Labor Department showed job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November, marking the lowest level since September 2020. The figure also came in below economists’ expectations. Layoffs edged higher during the period, while the number of people voluntarily quitting jobs — an indicator of worker confidence — remained broadly unchanged at 3.2 million.The data highlights a widening gap between economic expansion and hiring momentum. While gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace in two years during the July–September quarter, job creation has slowed significantly. Employers have added an average of just 28,000 jobs per month since March, compared with roughly 400,000 monthly additions during the post-pandemic hiring surge between 2021 and 2023.Upcoming labour market data is expected to show modest improvement. Economists anticipate that January employment numbers, due next week, may show around 70,000 new jobs added, up from 50,000 in December.Recent private data has also pointed to subdued hiring conditions. Payroll processor ADP reported that private sector employers added only 22,000 jobs last month, far below market forecasts. Separately, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said companies announced more than 108,000 job cuts, the highest monthly total since October and the weakest January reading since 2009.Commenting on the trend, Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said: “The hiring recession isn’t going to end anytime soon. Job openings in December just fell to their lowest level since September 2020. It’s yet another sign of how little hiring – or interest in hiring – is happening in this economy.”Economists remain divided on the outlook, debating whether hiring will eventually pick up to match strong economic growth, whether growth may slow to reflect labour market weakness, or whether advances in artificial intelligence and automation could allow output to expand without significant job creation.","Job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November.

While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

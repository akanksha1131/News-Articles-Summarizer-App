Gold and silver price prediction today: Gold prices and silver prices continue to exhibit a bullish trend, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group. He shares his views on gold and silver:MCX Gold continues to remain on a bullish trajectory, despite witnessing some correction ahead of the recent Federal Reserve meeting. The pullback was more of a profit-booking phase rather than a trend reversal, as the broader sentiment for gold still favors the upside. Currently, gold prices have approached a very crucial support zone around ₹1,09,000 levels, which is likely to act as a strong floor for the metal. As long as prices sustain above this level, the overall structure remains positive, keeping buyers in control.The resilience of gold at this support indicates that market participants are still positioning themselves for higher levels. Key drivers such as global uncertainty, demand for safe-haven assets, and expectations of interest rate policies continue to lend strength to the metal. Technically, holding above the support opens the possibility of a move towards ₹1,11,000 levels in the near term.A decisive breakout above this level may further extend the bullish momentum.On the downside, a breach below ₹1,09,000 could invite fresh selling pressure, but until that occurs, the outlook stays constructive. Traders and investors are advised to remain cautiously optimistic, with a focus on buying at dips near the support zone.MCX Silver witnessed a healthy correction from ₹1,30,000 to ₹1,26,000 levels ahead of the recent Federal Reserve meeting, as traders preferred to book profits and stay cautious before the policy outcome. However, this decline appears more like a short-term retracement rather than a reversal in trend. The broader structure of silver continues to remain positive, supported by robust industrial demand, safe-haven buying, and global cues that favor precious metals in the medium term.Currently, silver is finding strong support near ₹1,25,000 levels, which is expected to act as a cushion against further downside. As long as prices sustain above this zone, the bias remains firmly upward. On the higher side, silver has the potential to rebound towards ₹1,29,000 levels, a zone that may act as immediate resistance. A sustained move above ₹1,29,000 could even pave the way for retesting the ₹1,30,000 levels once again.From a technical perspective, dips towards support are being viewed as fresh buying opportunities by traders, indicating continued bullish sentiment. On the flip side, a break below ₹1,25,000 may invite additional weakness. Until then, the outlook remains constructive, and investors may consider a buy-on-dips strategy.","Gold prices and silver prices continue to exhibit a bullish trend, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: Has deadline for Income Tax Returns filing been extended beyond September 15? Income Tax Department clarifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-2025-has-the-deadline-been-pushed-beyond-september-15-what-income-tax-dept-said/articleshow/123891607.cms,"Representative image





The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15, clarifying that the due date remains unchanged.In a post on X, the department said: “A fake news is in circulation stating that the due of filing ITRs (originally due on 31.07.2025, and extended to 15.09.2025) has been further extended to 30.09.2025. The due date for filing ITRs remains 15.09.2025.”The clarification came amid a wave of unverified messages circulating online.The I-T department has urged taxpayers to rely only on updates from its verified handle @IncomeTaxIndia and avoid being misled by false claims. It further noted that its helpdesk is working “on a 24x7 basis” to support taxpayers with ITR filing, tax payment and other related services through calls, live chats, WebEx sessions and X.Over six crore ITRs had already been filed for the Assessment Year 2025-26 as of Saturday.The department thanked taxpayers and professionals for their efforts, while reminding those yet to file to do so before the September 15 deadline to avoid last-minute delays, penalties and interest.The filing window had originally closed on July 31 but was extended to September 15 due to revisions introduced in ITR forms earlier this year.These “structural and content revisions” were rolled out in April–May, requiring changes to filing utilities and back-end systems, which prompted the extension.While this relaxation covered individuals, HUFs and non-audit entities, officials have underlined that a further extension is “unlikely.”Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, though this attracts late fees under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act — Rs 1,000 for income up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for income above that threshold.Delays also trigger interest liabilities under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C. Moreover, belated filers are shifted to the new tax regime by default and lose the ability to carry forward certain business or capital losses.ITR submissions have been steadily rising in recent years. For AY 2024-25, a record 7.28 crore returns were filed by July 31, 2024, up from 6.77 crore the previous year, marking a 7.5% annual increase.With Monday marking the final day, the department has reiterated its appeal: file early, comply on time, and avoid penalties.",The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15.

FOMC meet: What does US Fed rate cut mean for Indian stock markets?

(AI image)

What US Federal Reserve Said

How does the US Fed rate cut impact Indian stock markets?

So, will the Fed rate cut fuel a rally in the stock market? Experts say a 25 basis points cut is factored in.





The US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday . The rate cut was on expected lines, and came amidst rising pressure from US President Donald Trump . US is the world's largest economy and any benchmark rate movement by its central bank has global implications.So what will be the impact of the US Fed rate cut on the Indian stock markets? Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, are up over 5% year-to-date, but the stock market is still below its all-time high achieved in September last year.India’s fundamental growth story remains strong, but the stock market volatility has been particularly significant this year. The global trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump has sent jitters, but Indian stock markets have in general underperformed this year, and Foreign Institutional Investors have pulled out billions of dollars. Will the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates spur a rally or will Nifty50 and BSE Sensex remain range-bound in the coming weeks?Flagging risks of slowing economic growth and job gains, the US Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points, lowering the benchmark range to 4% to 4.25%. The FOMC has also signalled the possibility of two more rate cuts in this year, and one in 2026.""Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated,"" said the US Fed in its statement.""The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,"" it added.Market experts are of the view that rate cut will be a net positive for the Indian stock markets, despite US stocks becoming attractive.Ankit Mandholia, Head Equity and Derivatives, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services explains, “Lower US yields reduce the relative appeal of American bonds, encouraging foreign investors to channel more funds into emerging markets like India. A softer dollar aids rupee stability, helping curb import inflation and supporting investor sentiment.”“Enhanced global liquidity typically fuels risk-on appetite, benefiting equities and credit markets,” he tells TOI.“While improved prospects for US markets may attract some flows back home, India’s robust growth outlook and earnings visibility ensure it retains a strong relative appeal. Overall, Fed easing enhances liquidity, reduces macro headwinds, and supports Indian stock performance,” he adds.“The rate cut by the US Fed is partially discounted by domestic markets. Having said that, the rate cut by the US Fed augurs well for riskier assets like EM and commodities. Funds may move out of safe haven and may chase better yielding assets. Sentimentally, rate cut also augurs well for domestic IT and Metal companies in the short term,” Sunny Agrawal, Head - Fundamental Research at SBI Securities told TOI.Vijay Singh Gour, Fundamental Analyst at Miare Asset Sharekhan also believes the rate cut is factored in. “A dovish tone and more than two rate cuts in CY2025 could result in a weaker US Dollar, lower global yields, and a somewhat stronger Indian rupee. The scenario could potentially reverse significant Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) outflows observed during FY2025 and FY2026 (so far), which would likely cheer up the Indian stock markets,” he said.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments points out that bond yields have already drifted down.He also notes that recent experience suggests that US Fed rate action has only a temporary and limited impact on the Indian stock market. The rate hikes by the US Fed since March 2022 didn’t impact the Indian stock market negatively, he tells TOI.“The market trend in the medium to long-term will be dictated by GDP growth and corporate earnings. When growth and corporate earnings improve, FIIs will turn buyers in India since India has the best long-term growth story among emerging markets,” he concludes.Santosh Pandey, President & Head, Nuvama Professional Clients group believes that global EMs will be in favour, including India by global investors post US rate cut.“While EMs and US S&P/NASDAQ have moved up substantially in the last 12-18 months, India is the only market where returns are flat to negative. Also in the global markets index, India’s weight has reduced due to other markets having moved up. Hence if the US-India tensions ease, India can be the market of the year for the calendar year 2026 backed by income tax cuts, repo rate being slashed and GST rationalisation,” he tells TOI.To sum up, Indian stock markets have already built in a rate cut, and while the US Federal Reserve’s commentary will be a short-term driver for the markets, the possible news of India-US trade deal being sealed in the coming months is expected to be a bigger sentiment mover.","The US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

We expect the next burst of up move to commence above 6950 for the target of 7300-7400.Stock has broken out of a downward sloping trendline with highest daily volume in 2 months. Such breakouts backed by strong volumes tend to gather strong momentum. The follow through move in this counter is expected to take stock to new all time highs which is only 10% away.Stock has been trading at its all-time high levels owing to strong underlying momentum in gold prices. We expect the momentum to continue and a close above 300 can lead to another 6-8% rally.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, the top buy calls for today are: Eicher Motors, JSW Infrastructure, and Manappuram Finance.

India’s first private strategic petroleum reserve: Top things to know

The venture includes a crude oil filling expense of $1.25 billion (Rs 11,020 crore) at present rates, representing the most substantial private investment towards strengthening the nation's energy security infrastructure.

The company has been allocated a five-year construction period and a 60-year operational term for a 2.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) strategic petroleum reserve facility in Padur, Karnataka. Padur already hosts portions of India's current strategic reserves.

This new reserve will enhance India's present 5.33-MMT strategic reserves, which currently provide only 8-9 days of crude supply when at capacity, the ET report said.

The bidding process, managed by the state-owned Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL), was determined by the viability gap funding (VGF) requirements of participants. The VGF was restricted to 60% of the Rs 5,700-crore project value, amounting to Rs 3,420 crore.

The current strategic petroleum reserve facilities in India, managed by ISPRL, maintain 39 million barrels in underground storage at Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru, and Padur.

This capacity falls significantly short compared to the United States' 727 million barrels and China's estimated 1,200 million barrels.

Readying Buffer





India is looking to build its first-ever private sector strategic petroleum reserve in the next five years. The massive Rs 5,700 crore project contract has been awarded to Megha Engineering & Infrastructures Ltd.According to an ET report quoting sources, Megha Engineering has bagged the significant contract to construct and operate the first private-sector strategic petroleum reserve.Megha emerged as the successful bidder with an offer just under the maximum limit, surpassing two competitors whose identities remain undisclosed, according to informed sources quoted in the report.Sources indicate that ISPRL will shortly finalise the agreement with Megha, providing them a 214-acre plot at no cost for storage development. The agreement is expected to include provisions requiring the company to partially fill the SPR cavern to ensure emergency preparedness objectives are met.According to sources quoted in the report, Megha plans to recover its investment through storage space rentals to the government and oil firms, whilst maintaining autonomy in crude oil trading operations.Whilst storage leasing provides steady revenue, trading activities involve higher risks and require specialist knowledge.The government will maintain priority access to oil reserves during emergencies, ensuring the facility serves both commercial and strategic national interests.The Padur facility includes the construction of specialised infrastructure for oil handling, including both onshore and offshore pipeline networks.Megha's primary business involves EPC contracting for the oil and gas industry, including refinery construction, pipeline installation and rig provision. The company is currently developing an underground LPG storage facility for Hindustan Petroleum.Operating an SPR represents a significant new venture for this Hyderabad-based organisation. The concept of private involvement in India's strategic petroleum reserves was initially proposed more than ten years ago.In 2018, the Union cabinet granted preliminary approval for two PPP model projects: Padur in Karnataka (2.5 MMT) and Chandikhol in Odisha (4 MMT). The development of a suitable framework to attract private investment required several years of planning.","India is looking to build its first-ever private sector strategic petroleum reserve.

NEW DELHI: Stock market regulator Sebi on Thursday dismissed allegations of stock manipulation against Gautam Adani and Adani group companies by US based short seller Hindenburg Research and said there was no evidence of the group using related parties to route funds to listed companies.In two orders posted on its website, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said there is no violation of listing agreement or Sebi regulations as the impugned transactions do not qualify as ""related party transactions"".""Transparency and integrity have always defined the Adani Group,"" Gautam Adani said on X after Sebi put out the orders on its website.Hindenburg Research published a report on Jan 24, 2023, against Adani Group which alleged that Adicorp Enterprises, Milestone Tradelinks and Rehvar Infrastructure were used as conduit entities to route funds from various Adani Group companies to fund publicly listed companies - Adani Power and Adani Enterprises.Sebi said the findings of the investigation revealed that Adani Ports transferred funds as loan to Adicorp Enterprises, which in turn transferred funds as loans to Adani Power. Subsequently, Adani Power repaid the loans to Adicorp Enterprises along with interest which in turn repaid the loans to Adani Ports with interest.""After an exhaustive investigation, Sebi has reaffirmed what we have always maintained, that Hindenburg claims were baseless.Transparency and integrity have always defined the Adani Group,"" Gautam Adani said on X after the orders were released.In another case, Adani Ports transferred funds as loans to Milestone Tradelinks and Rehvar Infrastructure, which in turn transferred funds to Adani Power and Adani Enterprises as loans.Subsequently, Adani Power and Adani Enterprises repaid the amounts to Milestone Tradelinks and Rehvar Infrastructure, along with interest, which in turn repaid the amounts to Adani Ports with interest. ""Thus loans were given and repaid with interest in various tranches during the investigation period,"" the regulator said.It said that on merit too, it is held that impugned transactions cannot be classified as manipulative or fraudulent transactions or unfair trade practice since there is no allegation of siphoning off of money or diversion of fund; all the money has come back with interest before the start of the investigation; and the impugned transactions have not been held as related party transactions.Hindenburg's report against the Adani Group, in Jan 2023, was released just as the group readied to launch its Rs 20,000-crore mega follow-on public offer for flagship Adani Enterprises. The five-year-old firm that researched stocks, debt and crypto currencies, alleged that the group was involved ""in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"". Adani Group stocks crashed and investors lost massively, while the report also triggered a massive political slugfest. The Adani Group had quickly rejected the report and called it ""a malicious combination of selective misinformation, stale and baseless allegations that have already been tested and rejected"" by the SC.Legal troubles mounted for the group after being indicted by the Department of Justice and the US Securities & Exchange Commission last year and the group came under intense scrutiny from investors."," stock market regulator Sebi on Thursday dismissed allegations of stock manipulation against Gautam Adani and Adani group companies by US based short seller Hindenburg Research.

Trump: Close ties but tough measures



Lavrov dismisses Russia sanctions







Russia slammed US tariff threats against India and China, calling them ""ancient civilisations,"" claiming that threat to them ""won't work,"" as both the nations are unlikely to bow down to ultimatums.Speaking on Russia's mainForeign minister Sergei Lavrov said, ""Both China and India are ancient civilisations. And talking to them like 'either you stop doing what I don't like or I'll impose tariffs on you' won't work. And the ongoing contacts between Beijing and Washington, between New Delhi and Washington, show that the American side understands it, too.""The comments came against the backdrop of escalating US criticism of India for continuing to import oil from Moscow despite the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.The Donald Trump administration recently hiked tariffs on Indian goods from 25% on August 7 to 50% by August 27, directly citing New Delhi's oil purchases from Moscow.Lavrov pointed out that US trade threats have forced countries like India and China to look for ""new markets, new sources of energy supplies"" and pay higher costs.""Besides the fact that this undermines the economic well-being of those countries, it at least creates very serious difficulties for them, forcing them to seek new markets, new sources of energy supplies, (and) forcing them to pay higher prices,"" he said.""But beyond this, and perhaps even more importantly than this, there is a moral and political opposition to this approach,"" he added.During his recent state visit to Britain, Trump struck a contradictory tone, stressing his personal ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi even as he defended sanctions on India.""When I found out that the European nations were buying oil from Russia, I am very close to India and to the PM of India, I wished him a happy birthday the other day, we have a very good relationship, but I sanctioned them (India),"" he said.""If the price of oil comes down, Putin will have no choice but to drop out of that war,"" he added. He further argued that India’s continued energy trade with Moscow was ""not playing fair with the US.""White House trade adviser Peter Navarro echoed this hard line, branding India the ""maharaja of tariffs"" and accusing Indian refiners of ""profiteering"" by working closely with Russian suppliers after the invasion.""Indian refiners were in bed with Russian refiners immediately after the invasion. They make money off us via unfair trade and many workers get screwed. They use that money to buy Russian oil, and Russians use that to buy weapons,"" Navarro alleged.Lavrov, however, dismissed concerns over new rounds of sanctions, saying Russia had already adapted to such measures.""Frankly speaking, I don't see any problem with the new sanctions imposed on Russia. An enormous amount of sanctions, unprecedented for that period, were imposed during President Donald Trump's first term,"" Lavrov said.Reflecting on the broader trajectory of US policy, he added, ""We have started to draw conclusions from the situation when the West imposed these sanctions. Later, during President Joe Biden's term, sanctions were used as a replacement for any diplomatic effort. There was no search for a compromise.""Despite tensions, India and the US have been in talks for an interim trade deal over the past few months. But with tariffs rising and geopolitical pressures mounting, both New Delhi and Beijing continue to assert their independent paths, reinforced by Moscow’s backing.","Sergei Lavrov: India and China are ""ancient civilisations"" and won't bow down to ultimatums.

Nvidia agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel and said the two will co-develop chips for PCs and data centres, a surprise move to help prop up an ailing archrival that sent Intel shares soaring.Nvidia will buy Intel common stock at $23 per share, the two companies said on Thursday. Intel will use Nvidia's graphics technology in upcoming PC chips and also provide its processors for data centre products built around Nvidia hardware. The two companies didn't offer a timeline for when the first parts will go on sale and said the announcement doesn't affect their individual future plans.The new funds for Intel come after the US govt agreed in Aug to take a roughly 10% stake in it and President Donald Trump took on the role of pitchman. Japan's SoftBank Group, which has committed to invest tens of billions into US chipmaking and cloud infrastructure, made a surprise $2-billion investment last month and Intel is also raising cash by selling assets to investors. Its current operations, hit by market share losses, cannot shoulder the burden of intensive spending associated with trying to build leading-edge semiconductors.Intel's stock surged by as much as 28% after markets opened in New York.On paper, the value of the US govt's stake has jumped more than 55% to $4.9 billion.The tie-up between the two Santa Clara, California-based rivals underlines how the balance of power in the computer industry has shifted.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices Last week saw a blend of inflation trends & political interference which involved Fed independence risk created a wave of uncertainty, boosting safe haven appeal for gold as it continued to hit record highs.In the US, mixed inflation data, cooling labour markets, and weakening consumer sentiment kept expectations of a Fed rate cut in place. In Europe, political instability in France added to economic pressure, while the ECB held rates steady. China grappled with deflationary pressures & Japan prepared for snap elections.Other asset classes included, global equity markets ending the week higher, while US Treasury yields, & the US dollar weakened, while oil prices edged up.Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week.

Gold has already surpassed the euro as the second most important reserve asset after the US dollar. Adjusting for over four decades of inflation the spot price of gold, also surpassed its inflation adjusted peak of $ 850 set on January 21, 1980 which comes to around $3590 per oz.The current week remains most crucial for gold as the US Fed may announce its monetary policy on September 17, midnight. It is widely expected that the central bank may go ahead to slash its interest rates by 25 bps, as a slight possibility of a 50 bp cut also exists. Overall possibility of 3 rate cuts persists by the end of the year. Having said that, a summary of economic projections which includes projections on interest rate cuts to be released by the US Fed during the meeting remains crucial to be assessed for further direction in precious metal prices.Overall, a likely hawkish cut could bring in profit booking moves in prices. However, chances of any major correction lower remains' limited, as the US labour market shows signs of weakening, where major supports lie at around $ 3620 – 3570 zone (CMP $ 3685).

What is the penalty for filing a belated return?



Can I claim a refund in a belated return?



How to file ITR after the due date?





Can a belated return be revised?







The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.The extension applies to those not required to undergo an income tax audit. This deadline has not been extended further.So, what happens if one misses the deadline?Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, but it may attract penalties and other consequences.Any ITR filed after the due date is considered a belated return and can be submitted until December 31, 2025. While filing a belated ITR allows taxpayers to comply with the law, it comes with certain limitations, including late fees and other potential consequences.Tax experts advise taxpayers to act promptly and file their ITR by September 16 to avoid unnecessary penalties and complications.Chartered Accountant Hitesh Jain, Partner – Direct Tax, N. A. Shah Associates LLP, explained that under Section 115BAC, effective from Assessment Year 2024-25, the new tax regime is the default option.Jain said, “So if a taxpayer wants to opt for the old regime, then ITR needs to be filed before the due date prescribed under Section 139(1) which is September 15, 2025 for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26).”This means that taxpayers without business income can select the old tax regime only through the original ITR filed on or before the due date. Jain added that deductions such as house rent allowance (HRA), home loan principal and interest under Section 80C, leave travel allowance (LTA), and others cannot be claimed if the ITR is filed after the deadline. In cases where the total tax liability is lower under the old regime, missing the September 15 deadline could lead to a higher effective tax liability.Taxpayers who miss the September 16 deadline for filing their ITR must pay a late fee of up to Rs 5,000. Those with an annual income exceeding Rs 5 lakh will be liable for a Rs 5,000 fee, while individuals earning below Rs 5 lakh will pay Rs 1,000. No late fee is charged for filing a nil belated return.A belated ITR is treated the same as a return filed on or before the original deadline when it comes to refunds. Taxpayers can claim a refund when filing a belated ITR, provided they complete all necessary bank validation and compliance requirements.One has to file an ITR after the due date (belated ITR) by logging into the ITR filing portal and then select the filing section as 139(4). The rest process is the same as filing an original ITR.Belated ITRs can be revised, but only until December 31, 2025. Any revision requests submitted after this date will not be accepted.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.

"US mortgage rates dip to lowest since October, 30-year loans fall to 6.26%; refinancing demand surges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-mortgage-rates-dip-to-lowest-since-october-30-year-loans-fall-to-6-26-refinancing-demand-surges/articleshow/123981503.cms,"



The average rate on a 30-year US mortgage fell again this week, reaching 6.26%, marking the lowest level since early October, amid a decline in long-term Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve’s first rate cut of 2025, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. Last week, the rate was 6.35%, and a year ago it averaged 6.09%.Rates on 15-year fixed mortgages, popular among homeowners refinancing their loans, also eased to 5.41% from 5.5% last week, compared with 5.15% a year ago. Mortgage rates generally track the 10-year Treasury yield, which was 4.12% in midday trading Thursday, up from 4.06% late Wednesday, AP reported.Mortgage rates have steadily declined since late July as expectations grew that the Fed would cut rates for the first time since 2024. On Wednesday, the central bank delivered a quarter-point cut and projected two more reductions this year amid concerns over the US job market.“Mortgage rates have eased into the low 6% range, a shift that should support a modest pickup in home sales in the coming months,” said Jiayi Xu, senior economist with Realtor.com. She added that the broader impact may remain limited, as 81% of homeowners hold mortgages below 6%, reducing incentives to sell or move.The decline in rates has sparked a surge in refinancing, particularly among homeowners who took loans when rates were above 6%. Mortgage applications, including purchases and refinancing, jumped nearly 30% last week compared with the prior week, with refinancing loans accounting for nearly 60% of the total, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) also rose sharply, making up about 13% of all applications — the highest share since 2008. “For consumers, it’s another signal that the cost of borrowing is gradually moving lower,” said Bill Banfield, chief business officer at Rocket Cos.","The average rate on a 30-year US mortgage fell again this week, reaching 6.26%.

Fed rate cut’s gradual effect on home loans

Relief on Credit Card Interest May Take Time

Bank savings not as lucrative

Auto loan rates likely to remain elevated





How does the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to the 4-4.25% range impact the lives of common people in America? The Federal Reserve establishes the federal funds rate, which governs inter-bank lending practices. Although consumer borrowing rates are not directly tied to this rate, Federal Reserve policy adjustments influence consumer costs for various financial products, including credit cards, vehicle financing, housing loans and other financial services.The Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve announced its first benchmark interest rate reduction in nine months on Wednesday. In the period since the previous reduction, inflation control has become less effective, coupled with a deteriorating employment situation. This combination has created difficulties for Americans, who now face elevated prices alongside employment challenges.The quarter-point reduction, the first since December, has brought the Fed's short-term rate to approximately 4.1%, reduced from 4.3%. The Federal Reserve anticipates implementing two additional rate reductions before the year concludes.The Fed rate cut was already factored into the market, which means it's ""unlikely to make a noticeable difference for most consumers at the time of the announcement,"" explains Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates.""Much of the impact on mortgage rates has already occurred through anticipation alone,"" he told AP. ""(Mortgage) rates have been falling since January and dropped further as weaker-than-expected economic data pointed to a cooling economy.""According to Kates, the decreasing interest rate environment will eventually provide relief to borrowers.""Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate,"" he noted.Credit card interest rates are hovering at an average of 20.13%, and cardholders with substantial debt might need to wait before experiencing the effects of the Federal Reserve's rate reduction. Nevertheless, any decrease in rates is beneficial for consumers.""While the broader impact of a rate reduction on consumers' financial health remains to be fully seen, it could offer some relief from the persistent budgetary pressures driven by inflation,"" said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of US research at credit reporting agency TransUnion, according to the AP report,""These savings could contribute to a reduction in delinquency rates across credit card and unsecured personal loan segments,"" she said.For individuals with significant credit card balances, the most effective strategy remains focusing on reducing high-interest debt. Additionally, they should explore options to transfer balances to cards with lower annual percentage rates or directly discuss accommodations with their credit card providers.According to the AP report, bank customers will soon witness a gradual decline in the attractive interest rates currently available on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts.Currently, the finest rates available stand at approximately 4% for CDs and 4.6% for high-yield savings accounts.These figures remain advantageous compared to historical patterns and present viable options for individuals seeking returns on readily accessible funds.High-yield savings accounts typically offer substantially higher annual percentage yields compared to conventional savings accounts. Traditional savings accounts presently average 0.38% nationwide.Whilst some accounts might maintain returns of roughly 4% until the end of 2025, according to Ken Tumin, founder of , the Federal Reserve's rate reductions will inevitably affect these products, resulting in reduced average yields.Vehicle loan rates in the US have continued to rise since early 2022, following the Federal Reserve's decision to increase its benchmark interest rate. Analysts suggest that these elevated rates are likely to persist, and even with rate cuts, the relief may be gradual.""If the auto market starts to freeze up and people aren't buying cars, then we may see lending margins start to shrink, but auto loan rates don't move in lockstep with the Fed rate,"" explained Bankrate analyst Stephen Kates.Whilst new vehicle prices have stabilised recently, they continue to maintain historically high levels, without accounting for inflation.Currently, annual percentage rates for automobile loans typically range from 4% to 30%. According to Bankrate's latest weekly assessment, the average interest rate for a 60-month new car loan stands at 7.19%.","The Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve announced its first benchmark interest rate reduction in nine months on Wednesday.

Disruption or Opportunity?



(With inputs from ANI)





Artificial intelligence is emerging as one of the most powerful forces reshaping global business, with far-reaching implications for jobs, productivity adding trillions of dollars in economic value.A new Morgan Stanley Research report suggests that AI adoption could impact nearly 90 per cent of occupations while driving a massive boost in corporate valuations.The report stated that, ""AI Could Affect 90 per cent of Occupations......In the long term, this potentially translates to a market cap increase of $13 trillion to $16 trillion for the S&P 500 alone"".It estimated that full-scale AI adoption across S&P 500 companies could deliver an annual net benefit of around $920 billion.Of this, $490 billion is expected to come from “agentic AI”—software capable of planning, decision-making, and executing tasks with little human oversight—while $430 billion could be generated through embodied AI, such as humanoid robots.Morgan Stanley highlighted that this surge in productivity could fuel a dramatic rise in stock market value.""As corporations pour billions into artificial intelligence, investors are asking the trillion-dollar question: Will this tech revolution supercharge productivity and profits, or simply automate away jobs?"" the report stated.Yet the outlook is not purely about displacement.The report noted that technological revolutions, from electrification to the internet, have historically reshaped work while creating new kinds of employment. AI, it suggested, may follow a similar path by displacing some roles but also generating new professions and driving demand for re-skilling.Heather Berger, US economist at Morgan Stanley, noted that, ""While some roles may be automated, others will see enhancement through AI augmentation, and AI is likely to create entirely new roles.""Companies are already adapting by establishing new leadership positions such as Chief AI Officer to oversee adoption, while growth is also expected in areas like data governance, compliance, and information security.The report identified consumer staples distribution and retail, real estate management and development, and transportation as three sectors with the greatest potential for AI-driven value.From supply-chain optimisation and personalised pricing in retail, to humanoid assistance in real estate, and autonomous delivery in logistics, AI could redefine operations across industries.As AI capabilities continue to double roughly every seven months, Morgan Stanley urged investors to closely track adoption potential.

The US Federal Reserve , commonly known as the Fed, lowered its benchmark rate Wednesday by a quarter percentage point, the first such cut since last year.It cut the benchmark lending rate to a range between 4.0% and 4.25%.The Fed paused its easing cycle in January due to uncertainty over how President Donald Trump's import tariffs might affect inflation and the overall economy.It said Wednesday's cut was warranted as, ""downside risks to employment have risen"" even as inflation has ""moved up and remains somewhat elevated.""Although inflation remains slightly above the Fed's target rate of 2%, data shows hiring has slowed to a halt in recent months, while the unemployment rate has risen.Lowering interest rates, and reducing borrowing costs, is tool used by central banks to boost hiring and increase consumer spending.The new Fed Governor, Stephen Miran, formerly an economic adviser to Trump, voted against the decision, favoring a deeper cut of 50 basis points.Miran was sworn in earlier this week, amid criticism from Democrats that he would not separate economic decision making from political pressure.The other 11 voting members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted for the quarter-point cut.Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who acts independently of the White House, to cut interest rates for months.He has tried to pressure Powell to resign and has openly considered firing him.Powell said Wednesday the Fed was ""right to wait and see how tariffs and inflation and the labor market evolved"" before lowering rates.He added the the central bank was ""strongly committed"" to maintaining its independence from politics.On Tuesday, Democrats introduced a Senate bill aimed at reinforcing the separation between the White House and the Federal Reserve, just hours after Miran was sworn in as a Fed governor.Meanwhile, an appeals court upheld an injunction allowing Governor Lisa Cook to participate, despite ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to remove her.Fed officials signaled that they expect to reduce their key rate twice more this year, but just once in 2026.",The US Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate Wednesday by a quarter percentage point.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Why China is probing Nvidia?



Nvidia shares slip as Beijing launches probe



A pawn in the 'digital Cold War'







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Wednesday admitted the chipmaker is caught in the crossfire of the US-China trade war, saying Washington and Beijing ""have larger agendas to work out"" as the company struggles to balance soaring global demand for its AI chips with tightening political restrictions.Speaking in London on Wednesday, Huang said, ""We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,"" further adding that, ""I'm disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States, and I'm patient about it.""""We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish,"" Huang said, stressing Nvidia’s intent to keep engaging with China despite regulatory hurdles.The remarks came after the Financial Times reported that China’s internet regulator had instructed leading firms including ByteDance and Alibaba to cancel orders and testing of Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D, its latest China-tailored AI chip.China’s market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), also launched a preliminary probe into Nvidia alleging its violation of the country’s anti-monopoly law, though it did not share details of the breach.Chinese regulators have launched a preliminary investigation into US chipmaker Nvidia, saying the company has violated the country’s anti-monopoly laws. Authorities said the probe will continue, while Nvidia maintained it has complied with all regulations and will cooperate fully.The investigation focuses on Nvidia’s $6.9 billion acquisition of Israeli-American firm Mellanox Technologies in 2019. At the time, China’s markets regulator approved the deal after an antitrust review, but imposed strict conditions, citing concerns that the merger could hurt competition in global and Chinese markets for GPU accelerators, high-speed Ethernet adapters, and network interconnect equipment, according to state media Xinhua.In July, China’s cyberspace regulator reportedly summoned the company over “security risks” linked to potential vulnerabilities in its H20 AI chips.The Financial Times later reported that Chinese officials were angered by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s comments that Washington would never sell China its “best” or even “third-best” technology, but only enough to make Chinese firms dependent on the American tech stack.Nvidia, valued at over $4.2 trillion, saw its shares fall 2.6% after the news on Wednesday. Beijing has also launched a preliminary anti-monopoly probe into the company’s practices.The latest restrictions extend earlier guidance that targeted Nvidia’s H20 chip, a model designed to meet US export rules, Reuters reported.The RTX6000D, introduced for the Chinese market, has seen tepid demand due to cost concerns, and some firms have already pulled back from placing orders.""Jensen Huang’s diplomatic comment about ‘larger agendas’ is CEO-speak for ‘We’re pawns in a digital Cold War,'"" Michael Ashley Schulman, CIO of Running Point Capital Advisors told Reuters.Successive US administrations have restricted Chinese access to advanced semiconductors, while Beijing has pressed local firms to reduce dependence on US suppliers.In August, US President Donald Trump allowed Nvidia to sell H20 chips to China in exchange for a 15% revenue cut, though shipments have yet to move.Amid the uncertainty, Nvidia has boosted its lobbying in Washington, hiring three external firms and spending $1.9 million in the first half of 2025, far more than the $640,000 it spent in all of 2024.China accounted for 13% of Nvidia’s sales last year, but the new restrictions could further pressure its business in one of the world’s biggest chip markets.""In today's global tech scene, multi-nationals like Nvidia are expected to code-switch between Washington's national security doctrines and Beijing's techno-sovereignty demands, all while keeping shareholders happy,"" Schulman added.",Chinese regulators have launched a preliminary investigation into US chipmaker Nvidia.

NEW DELHI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) could lead to significant increases in trade and GDP by 2040, with global trade projected to rise by 34-37% across different scenarios, a report released by the World Trade Organisation said on Wednesday. The report said that the largest growth occurs in trade of digitally deliverable services (42%), including AI services.“This trade increase reflects (i) reduced operational trade costs, (ii) strong projected growth of AI services combined with high tradability of AI services, related to its geographic concentration of production in a few regions, and (iii) the above average productivity growth in more tradable sectors, in particular digitally deliverable services,” according to the WTO’s World Trade report.“The development and deployment of AI are also projected to generate substantial global GDP increases, ranging from 12 to 13% across scenarios,” said the report.It said that AI tools are already enhancing trade efficiency by improving visibility within supply chains, automating customs clearance, reducing language barriers, strengthening market intelligence, improving contract enforcement and helping firms, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), to navigate complex regulations.“AI has vast potential to lower trade costs and boost productivity, as well as to create new avenues for services production and exports,” said WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.WTO research showed that among firms currently using AI, nearly 90% reported tangible benefits in trade related activities, and 56% said that it had enhanced their ability to manage trade risks.But the report also cautioned about the risks of a widening digital divide.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) could lead to significant increases in trade and GDP by 2040.

WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday and indicated it will steadily lower borrowing costs for the rest of this year, as policymakers responded to concerns about weakness in the job market in a move that won support from most of President Donald Trump’s central bank appointees.Only new governor Stephen Miran, who joined the Fed on Tuesday and is on leave as the head of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, dissented in favor of a half-percentage-point cut. The rate cut, along with projections showing two more quarter-percentagepoint reductions are anticipated at the remaining two policy meets this year, indicate Fed officials have begun to downplay the risk that the administration’s trade policies will stoke persistent inflation, and are now more concerned about weakening growth and the likelihood of rising unemployment.The cut, the first move by the policy-setting federal open market committee since Dec, moves the policy rate to the 4-4.25 per cent range.“The committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the Fed said in its policy statement. “Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up.”New economic projections showed policymakers at the median still see inflation ending this year at 3 per cent, well above the central bank’s 2 per cent target, a projection unchanged from the Fed’s last set of forecasts published in June. The projection for unemployment was also unchanged at 4.5 per cent and economic growth slightly higher at 1.6% versus 1.4 per cent.(REUTERS)","The cut, the first move by the policy-setting federal open market committee since Dec, moves the policy rate to the 4-4.25 per cent range. “The committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the Fed said in its policy statement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123962869,imgsize-1009501,width-400,resizemode-4/jerome-powell-file-photo.jpg"

US Federal Reserve rate cut: Top points to know

US Fed aims to maintain peak employment levels while targeting a long-term inflation rate of 2 percent. The economic outlook continues to show significant uncertainty, with the Committee noting increased risks to employment opportunities.

When evaluating potential changes to the federal funds rate target range, the Committee shall thoroughly analyse new data, future prospects and risk factors.

It maintains its commitment to decrease holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.

The FOMC remains firmly dedicated to fostering maximum employment whilst bringing inflation back to its 2 percent target.

The Committee shall continue evaluating incoming information's impact on economic prospects whilst determining appropriate monetary policy measures.

Should any risks surface that might hinder achieving the FOMC’s objectives, it is ready to modify monetary policy accordingly.

FOMC’s evaluations shall encompass diverse factors, including labour market conditions, inflation metrics and expectations, alongside financial and global economic developments.





US Fed FOMC Meeting: Led by chairman Jerome Powell, the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced a 25 basis points rate cut after the FOMC meeting. ""In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent,"" read the FOMC statement.""Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated,"" it added.While all members of FOMC voted in favour of the 25 basis points cut, Stephen I. Miran, the Donald Trump pick, recently appointed as US Fed governor voted for a 50 basis points cut. The FOMC has pencilled in two more rate cuts for this year. It has also raised the GDP growth forecast to 1.6% from its June projection of 1.4% while keeping the outlook for inflation and unemployment unchanged.This is the first rate cut by the US Fed in 2025 even as it navigates through conflicting pressures, including pressure from US President Donald Trump and potential internal disagreements amongst its members. Trump has consistently been slamming Powell-led US Fed for not cutting rates, calling the Fed chairman 'too late'.Stock markets and economists had widely expected the 25 basis points rate cut. Following its previous reduction in December, the Federal Reserve had maintained interest rates within the range of 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent.The Federal Reserve determines the federal funds rate, which governs interbank lending. Although consumers don't directly experience this rate, its fluctuations influence interest charges on various financial products, including credit cards, vehicle financing, home loans and other banking services.When establishing this rate, the Federal Reserve pursues two primary objectives, commonly referred to as the ""dual mandate"": controlling prices of goods and services, whilst promoting maximum employment.Conventionally, the US Federal Reserve raises rates to combat inflation and reduces them to stimulate economic expansion and job creation.At present, the US Fed faces a complex situation where inflation exceeds their 2% objective, yet employment figures remain suboptimal, creating a challenging policy environment.Current data indicates increasing difficulty in job acquisition, potentially compelling the Federal Reserve to prioritise employment concerns over inflationary pressures.The Federal Reserve has maintained steady rates this year, concerned that rate reductions could increase inflation, particularly given their worries about how President Donald Trump's tariffs might affect product prices. Inflation remains persistently above the Federal Reserve's 2% benchmark.","US Fed aims to maintain peak employment levels while targeting a long-term inflation rate of 2 percent.

Split within the EU

How it would work





The European Union on Wednesday unveiled its strongest plan so far to pressurise Israel to end the war in Gaza, which has now dragged on for 23 months.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has called on the bloc’s 27 countries to raise tariffs on some Israeli goods and place sanctions on Israeli settlers, as well as two cabinet ministers in PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.Her proposal also mentions sanctioning ten Hamas leaders.“We are proposing these measures not to punish Israel or Israel people, but to really try to pressure (the) Israeli government to change course and to end the human suffering in Gaza,"" Kallas said at a press conference in Brussels.""The war needs to end, the suffering must stop, and all hostages must be released.”The sanctions would mean freezing any European assets belonging to those targeted and banning them from travelling in the EU.As the EU is Israel’s largest trading partner, the move could have serious economic effects. Israel’s economy has already been shaken by the long war. The commission also said around 32 million euros ($37.5 million) in bilateral funds would be frozen, though financial aid for the Palestinian Authority will continue.Israel has rejected claims of starvation in Gaza and insists it is allowing enough humanitarian aid into the territory.The measures reflect growing friction between Europe and Israel. Just last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has until now been seen as a strong ally of Israel, said Europe needed to put pressure on Israel over its military campaign.However, Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar accused von der Leyen of siding with terrorists and vowed Israel would not give in.“Pressure through sanctions will not work. The State of Israel is a proud sovereign nation, and we will not be bent through threats while Israel’s security is at stake,” he wrote in a letter to her.The 27 EU countries remain divided on how to deal with Israel, and it is not certain that a majority will support the sanctions and trade measures.The bloodshed in Gaza has triggered large protests across Europe, including in Amsterdam and Barcelona, and raised questions over whether Brussels is doing enough to stop the war and get more aid in.Health officials in Gaza said on Wednesday that more than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel.European Commission trade chief Maros Sefcovic described the plan as “a carefully considered response to an increasingly urgent situation.”If approved, tariffs worth around 230 million euros ($166 million) would be applied to about 37% of Israeli goods imported into the EU, currently worth 15.9 billion euros a year. Those goods now enter tariff-free under an Association Agreement between the two sides.An EU review earlier this year found that Israel had broken the human rights commitments in that agreement, known as Article 2. Critics have been pushing for the entire trade deal to be suspended, but for now the commission is only proposing to remove the zero-tariff benefit for some goods. Those items would instead face standard World Trade Organization tariffs, ranging from 8% to 40%.The proposal follows von der Leyen’s call last week for sanctions and a partial suspension of trade with Israel.EU officials said Israel’s war in Gaza, along with increasing settler violence in the West Bank linked to Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, had created “new momentum” for the move. However, Israeli arms exports to the EU would not be affected.","EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has called on the bloc’s 27 countries to raise tariffs on some Israeli goods and place sanctions on Israeli settlers.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





The reason behind American trade overtures towards India amid punitive tariffs, manifested in President Trump’s friendly messages to Prime Minister Modi and sending a key trade negotiator to New Delhi, lies not just in the chambers of commerce in Washington DC, but in the vast farm lands of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and other states in Middle America.Scores of reports and interviews with farmers reveal a growing sense of panic over unsold soy beans and corn, the top two US agricultural exports. The disquiet is channeling into anger at the Trump administration, whose decision, prompted by the President, to engage in a tariff war, particularly against China, has resulted in retaliatory measures by Beijing which has ended all agri purchases from US. China buys more than 60 percent of the world’s soya output, half of which comes from US, to feed its voracious pork industry.China is instead buying all its soya from Brazil, fueling Trump’s anger against BRICS while American farmers are fuming at Washington for the looming disaster ahead of the harvest season now underway. Soaring input costs, falling crop prices, the Chinese boycott, and growing uncertainty from trade policies, are causing what Caleb Ragland, a soybean farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, describes as a ""five-alarm fire.The upshot of all this is US farmers are on their knees, begging for intervention from the administration, which is now sending out its negotiators to talk to the Chinese, pleading with them to resume agri purchases, and even seeking New Delhi’s help with corn purchases even though India is self-sufficient in corn. US lawmakers, many of them Republicans from red MAGA leaning states, are worried about their prospects in the 2026 mid-term elections if there is no resolution to the tariff spat.These are some of the headlines one is seeing in the media reporting out of Middle America: Trump’s Tariffs DEVASTATE U.S. Farmers - Billions Lost in U.S. Agriculture ""US Soybean Growers Beg Trump for China Trade Deal,” and ""After Losing China Market, US Soybean President Realizes America Needs China to Be Great Again!Since most of Middle America is conservative Trump territory and predominantly support the President, Democrats and liberals are also having a field day trolling farmers via video posts with headlines such as ""MAGA Soybean Farmers Begging America for Socialism After Mocking Welfare for Years. Many are mocking MAGA “mugs” from not learning from Trump’s first term, when he picked a similar tariff fight with China and had to eventually bail out farmers to the tune of $ 20 billion.By one account, 216 farms filed for bankruptcy this year, a 55% increase from the previous year. And these are not small farms. Unlike in India, where the average agricultural holding is less than two acres, the average American farm is closer to 500 acres with some going up to 10,000 acres and more, and they are a big source of funding and political support to the GOP. Some of them are now having misgivings are what they see as Trump blunders, including tariffing steel and aluminum that have increased their input costs, while a few Democrat-leaning farmers are gloating with “I told you so” messages.Sarah Taber, a North Carolina farmer and crop scientist who ran for office as a Democrat in 2024, and who runs a popular farm blog, says the turn of events was entirely predictable."" I'm always surprised when people say we were ""lied to"" about what Trump would do to us. We weren't! US farmers knew Trump planned another trade war, and that it would hurt our businesses. And a lot of farmers just voted for him anyway,” she said in her podcast Farm to Taber.While American corn and soybean farmers are under stress, New Delhi is providing some relief to farmers growing tree nuts, having lifted tariffs on almonds and pistachios even as other major buyers like China and Turkey keep them on. India is now the largest buyer of “badam-pista” accounting for 70 percent and 90 percent of US exports of these two agricultural products.But that’s not enough to make MAGA folks happy. Reason: 90 percent of US treenuts are grown in California, a Democrat stronghold.","US farmers are on their knees, begging for intervention from the administration.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, Idea Forge Technology, and Avantel are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for June 6, 2025:

Bank NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the broad range of 56,000-53,500 in the last 6 weeks.

A key technical observation on the daily chart is that the index has already taken 6 weeks to retrace just 38.2% of the prior 2 weeks rally (49,157–56,098), indicating a shallow pullback that suggests underlying strength and potential higher bottom formation.

The Index is currently placed around the upper band of the last 6 weeks consolidation area 56,000-53,500. We believe closing above the 56,000 area will signal extension of the up move towards the 56,700 zone in the near term.

Failure to do so will signal extension of the last five weeks' consolidation. The short-term structure remains constructive with immediate support is placed at 55,000–55,200 levels, while key short-term support is seen at 54,000–53,500

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their consolidation phase for the third consecutive week, reflecting a lack of directional conviction amid a backdrop of profit-taking at higher levels and macroeconomic event risk ahead of the RBI monetary policy outcome on Friday.The broader markets exhibited notable resilience, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Small cap 100 indices climbing 1.3% and 3% respectively, signaling renewed risk appetite and accumulation in high-beta pockets of the market.From a technical standpoint, the Nifty continues to oscillate within a well-defined 17-session consolidation band, demarcated by support at 24,400–24,500 and resistance near the 25,050–25,080 zone. The 24,400–24,500 region remains pivotal, being both the site of the prior breakout and recent swing lows. This area has repeatedly attracted buying interest, indicating strong demand absorption and a possible accumulation zone.A decisive breach below the 24,400–24,500 support cluster could act as a bearish trigger, potentially exposing the index to deeper corrective downside. Conversely, sustained trade above 25080 levels will open upside towards 25,300 levels in the coming weeks.With the RBI monetary policy decision scheduled for Friday, the outcome of the policy, particularly commentary on liquidity, inflation trajectory, and growth forecasts, will be closely scrutinized for directional cues.The stock has generated a breakout above last 3 weeks broader range of 585-501 signaling resumption of up move thus offers fresh entry opportunityThe daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 670 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the recent range breakout (585-501)The stock is currently trading above the short- and long-term moving averages signaling strength and overall positive bias.It has recently generated a breakout above the falling supply line joining the highs of August and December 2024 signaling resumption of up move.The daily ADX is in an up trend thus supports the positive bias in the stock. We expect the stock to head towards the all-time high placed around 200 levels in the coming months","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Idea Forge Technology, and Avantel are the top stock picks for today. Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the broad range of 56,000-53,500 in the last 6 weeks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121663579,imgsize-53248,width-400,resizemode-4/121663579.jpg"

Gold and silver price prediction: Gold rates and silver rates have been volatile in the last few weeks, though recently there are signs of MCX Gold and MCX Silver rising. Precious metal prices are affected by worldwide geopolitical developments and market sentiment shifts following Donald Trump's tariff-related rulings. What’s the outlook for gold and silver prices and what should investors do?MCX Gold has recently surpassed its previous swing high of ₹97,700 (August 2025), signalling a bullish breakout from a falling channel pattern. This technical shift marks the end of a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating a potential trend reversal. The immediate resistance is at ₹99,900, the all-time high, with crucial support at ₹97,650.This bullish momentum is supported by factors such as safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions and volatility in the US dollar index. Additionally, expectations of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve have further bolstered investor sentiment, contributing to gold's upward trajectory.In summary, MCX Gold's recent breakout above ₹97,700 suggests a shift towards a bullish trend, with the all-time high of ₹99,900 serving as the next target.Investors should monitor support at ₹97,650 for potential reversals.MCX Silver has recently surged to an intraday high of ₹101,500 per kilogram, extending its rally towards the ₹103,700 mark. This upward movement not only signifies a potential breakout above its previous all-time high of ₹100,444 but also sets the stage for a new record if the momentum persists. Should prices sustain above ₹103,700, the next immediate target is ₹105,000.The bullish trend is underpinned by a confluence of factors, including heightened safe-haven demand amid global economic uncertainties, a declining US dollar index, and expectations of a potential rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. Additionally, silver's industrial applications and investment appeal have contributed to its robust performance.Technically, the overall bias remains firmly positive, with support at ₹99,700. A failure to maintain above this level could lead to a retest of lower support zones. However, as long as prices hold above ₹99,700, the bullish outlook remains intact, with potential for further gains towards ₹105,000 and beyond.","Gold rates and silver rates have been volatile in the last few weeks.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Friday ahead of the RBI policy review. While Nifty50 was below 24,750, BSE Sensex was down over 100 points. At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,731.05, down 20 points or 0.080%.

This unprecedented clash between two of the world’s most powerful and mercurial personalities will have its consequences on the policies of the US administration.

US bond yields are likely to fall further which will be positive for EMs, particularly India, whose growth prospects are the brightest.“In today’s monetary policy the RBI is likely to cut policy rates by 25 bp. This is already factored in by the market. More important will be the RBI commentary on growth and inflation projections for FY26.

Trump-Musk rift widens: Elon warns tariffs could trigger 'US recession by 2nd half of this year'; Tesla shares plunge 14%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-musk-rift-widens-elon-warns-tariffs-could-trigger-us-recession-by-2nd-half-of-this-year-tesla-shares-plunge-14/articleshow/121662827.cms,"Tesla shares plunge 14% wiping out $150 billion



The unlikely political marriage between Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Musk exploded in a fiery public divorce on Thursday (local time), after Elon publicly warned that the US President's ""aggressive new tariffs could cause a recession in the country by the second half of this year. """"The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year,"" Musk posted on X, marking a significant departure from his previous support for the president he once supported and counselled.The pair then hurled insults at each other on social media, with Musk accusing Trump, without evidence, of being named in government files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.In response, Trump said that he was ""very disappointed"" during a televised Oval Office address, slamming Musk for criticising his ""big, beautiful"" spending bill in Congress.""I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office while visiting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz observed quietly.""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,"" he added.The 78-year-old president noted during a 10-minute address that merely a week had passed since he hosted a farewell for Musk's departure from the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Trump subsequently labelled Musk ""crazy"" and maintained that he had requested the businessman's departure due to growing frustration.Musk responded immediately on X, asserting that Trump's 2024 electoral victory wouldn't have occurred without his support, whilst criticising Trump's lack of appreciation.The dispute intensified when Musk posted that Trump ""is in the Epstein files,"" referencing US government documents about Epstein, whose 2019 death in custody sparked widespread speculation.""Have a nice day, DJT!"" Musk added.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the news agency AFP that Musk's Epstein-related post ""is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' because it does not include the policies he wanted.""Musk, who contributed $300 million to Trump's campaign, independently stated the Republican's 2024 victory depended on his backing and denounced Trump's ingratitude. He affirmed support for Trump's impeachment and criticised Trump's worldwide tariffs as potentially recession-inducing.The president suggested penalising the ""crazy"" entrepreneur by threatening his substantial government contracts, including rocket launches and Starlink satellite service usage.""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.Musk in response hit back, saying he would start ""decommissioning"" SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft — which is crucial for Nasa missions to the International Space Station.Also read: Tesla stock price crash wipes out $150 bn; investors dump company The fallout triggered panic in financial markets, sending Tesla’s stock down over 14% on Thursday and wiping out nearly $150 billion in market value.The drop came just hours after Trump publicly attacked Musk, accusing him of turning against the administration over changes to a key tax and spending bill.This sharp decline erased some of the gains Tesla had made over the past two months, following Musk's announcement that the company would begin testing its driverless ""robotaxi"" service in Austin, Texas, this month.After Donald Trump’s election, investors heavily backed Tesla shares, focusing more on politics than the company’s performance. But on Thursday, things changed dramatically in just three hours, revealing the risks of that strategy.Following the November presidential election, investor enthusiasm drove Tesla's market value up by over $450 billion within weeks. The shares peaked in December, but subsequently declined when Musk's leadership of a government efficiency committee sparked boycotts and damaged Tesla's image.","Tesla shares plunge 14% wiping out $150 billion in market value.

Top stocks to buy or sell today: Stock recommendation for June 6,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/top-stocks-to-buy-or-sell-today-stock-recommendation-for-june-6/articleshow/121663851.cms,"J P Morgan has an overweight rating on Reliance Industries with a price target of Rs 1,568. Analysts feel that RIL’s Earnings in the next two years should be better than the last two. They said that RIL’s stock price has felt the pressure of large earnings cuts driven by weaker commodity EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). This should not recur (given the already low margins). Consumer business growth should translate better to bottom-line, helping relative performance.Motilal Oswal Financial services has downgraded Bharti Hexacom to neutral with the target price at Rs 1,900 as analysts feel the risk-reward for the stock is no longer attractive. They said that since they started their coverage of the stock in Mar ch 2-25, the stock has delivered 40%+ returns. Given that Bharti Hexacom provides a pure-play exposure to Bharti's fast-growing India wireless and homes business with slightly higher growth prospects, better RoCE (return on capital employed) and lower capital misallocation concerns, they had argued for a slight premium to its parent, Bharti Airtel.However, analysts now believe a premium of about 40% is steep and risk-reward is no longer attractive.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Vishal Megamart with a price target of Rs 161. Analysts said that the management believes the company can continue the current pace of store expansion in the medium term. The company has come a long way from close to bankruptcy to emerging as a successful aspirational (value) retailer.Incred Equities has maintained its add rating on TCS but with a reduced target price of Rs 3,589 from Rs 3,925 earlier. Analysts said that TCS shows better operating cash flow, dividend payout ratio certainty, and healthy return ratios, all of which support valuation while a slower recovery in North America and the FSI vertical, weak bookings, and higher project cancellations are downside risks.Elara Securities India has an accumulate rating on KEC International with the target price at Rs 1,020. Analysts said their rating is based on a robust order pipeline from domestic as well as international markets, scope for margin improvement, reduction of debt, potential for value unlocking through demerger of the cables business, and recovery of stuck cash from both civil and rail projects. With robust momentum in power T&D, real estate and infra, KEC Intl remains a preferred player in the EPC space with a prominent international presence to further boost visibility, they said.","J P Morgan has an overweight rating on Reliance Industries with a price target of Rs 1,568.

US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk , once allies, are now publicly feuding following disagreements over the government’s new tax bill. The rift, which has played out in a series of increasingly pointed online posts, appears to mark a significant break in their relationship.The spat intensified after Musk vocally criticised the bill, calling it “a disgusting abomination” and urging people to “kill the bill.” In response, Trump hit back on Thursday, expressing “disappointment in Elon” and claiming he had cut Musk out of key government decisions.""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised,"" Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office.Soon after, the president took to Truth Social to assert that he had rescinded Musk’s influence over electric vehicle (EV) policies. “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" Trump wrote.He also suggested a potential move to cut off Musk's federal support: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”Musk dismissed Trump's claims, responding with a curt rebuttal on X: “Such an obvious lie. So sad.” Taking a more light-hearted jab at Trump's threat to end federal contracts, Musk added, “This just gets better and better 🤣🤣 Go ahead, make my day …”In a separate post, Musk also asserted that Trump’s 2024 election win would not have been possible without his backing.“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” he claimed.Meanwhile, Trump continued to defend the bill saying, ""I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn’t create this mess, I’m just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""The fallout is notable given their history. Musk once praised Trump for efforts to reduce bureaucratic red tape and briefly served on the president’s business advisory council in early 2017. However, he stepped down that same year over differences regarding climate policy.In recent months, the two had appeared to reconcile, with Trump lauding Musk’s intellect and Musk supporting Trump’s reinstatement on social media platforms.

$100 billion wiped out!

Tesla shares have crashed 17% after CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump's spat turned ugly on Thursday. Musk, known to be one of Trump's biggest supporters has been critical of the US President's 'One Big Beautiful Bill', and the latter has hit out by calling the Tesla CEO 'crazy'.In his latest posts on social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!""""Elon was “wearing thin,” I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" Trump said in another post.The sharp decline was triggered instead by a bitter public spat between the two high-profile figures. Musk criticised the president’s recent tax bill, describing it on his social media platform X as a “disgusting abomination” that undermines cost-cutting efforts led by the department of government efficiency (DOGE), a team Musk has been closely involved with.Trump retaliated by suggesting Musk’s anger stemmed from the bill’s removal of tax incentives for electric vehicle (EV) purchases, accusing Musk of souring their previously friendly relationship.“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said, quoted by Reuters.“He said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn’t said bad about me personally. That’ll be next. But I’m very disappointed.""Musk, who is also the largest Republican donor in the 2024 election campaign, has been gradually distancing himself from White House activities, focusing more on his companies after facing backlash and protests related to Tesla. The fallout has impacted Tesla’s sales in key markets including Europe, China and California, despite growing overall demand for EVs.“Elon’s politics continue to harm the stock. First he aligned himself with Trump which upset many potential Democratic buyers. Now he has turned on the Trump administration,” said Tesla shareholder Dennis Dick, chief strategist at Stock Trader Network.Beyond Tesla, Musk’s other ventures such as SpaceX and Starlink, dominant players in commercial launches and satellite internet, have also come under scrutiny due to his political entanglements. These businesses benefit from regulatory approvals, often eased by Musk’s government ties.Since May 27, Tesla shares have dropped 12%, accelerating on Thursday. This volatility followed a roller-coaster ride after Musk endorsed Trump in July 2024, when the stock surged 169% before tumbling 54% amid a wave of protests and market uncertainty.Despite the turmoil, Tesla remains the world’s most valuable automaker, valued at around $1 trillion — far ahead of Toyota’s $290 billion market cap. However, its shares now trade at a staggering 140 times projected profits, a steep premium compared to other tech giants such as Nvidia.Tesla shares are down 22% so far this year, reflecting investor jitters over the company’s political entanglements and looming regulatory changes that threaten its bottom line.","Tesla shares have crashed 17% after CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump's spat turned ugly on Thursday. Musk criticised the president’s recent tax bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination” that undermines cost-cutting efforts led by the department of government efficiency. Trump retaliated by suggesting Musk's anger stemmed from the bill's removal of tax incentives for electric vehicle (EV) purchases, accusing Musk of souring their previously friendly relationship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121656651,imgsize-233517,width-400,resizemode-4/121656651.jpg"
Circle surges on NYSE debut: Crypto firm’s stock jumps 124% as stablecoin interest fuels investor demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/circle-surges-on-nyse-debut-crypto-firms-stock-jumps-124-as-stablecoin-interest-fuels-investor-demand/articleshow/121656317.cms,"Circle Internet Group, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, made a strong debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, with its shares soaring 124% in early trade amid heightened interest from crypto investors.Listed under the ticker symbol ""CRCL,"" Circle’s shares opened at $69.50, well above the IPO price of $31, and climbed further to $92.68 in afternoon trading. The stock offering marks one of the biggest public listings by a cryptocurrency-related company since Coinbase went public in 2021.According to the Associated Press, the company raised the number of shares in its initial public offering from 32 million to 34 million as demand surged. The IPO price had also been revised upward from the expected $27–$28 range to $31 per share.Circle issues USDC, a stablecoin pegged 1-to-1 to the US dollar, and EURC, which is similarly pegged to the euro. Stablecoins are designed to offer greater price stability than other cryptocurrencies by being backed by real-world assets such as fiat currency or government securities, making them more viable for commercial use.The company said in a regulatory filing that USDC has facilitated over $25 trillion in on-chain transactions since its launch in 2018. USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, with around $60 billion in circulation. The market leader remains Tether’s USDT, issued from El Salvador, with approximately $150 billion in circulation.Circle's revenue has grown rapidly, from just $15 million in 2020 to $1.7 billion in 2024. The firm generates income primarily through interest earned on the assets held to back its stablecoins. These reserves include cash, short-dated US Treasuries, and overnight Treasury repurchase agreements with global banks.The IPO comes at a time when the Trump administration and the crypto sector are backing legislation aimed at regulating stablecoin issuers in the US. A Senate bill addressing this framework advanced last month with bipartisan support.Meanwhile, the competition in the space is intensifying. A new stablecoin called USD1 was recently launched by a crypto venture partly owned by the Trump family.Despite the crowded field, Circle is positioning itself as a trusted and transparent player. “Our mission is to raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of value,” the company stated in its filings, citing its long operational history and adherence to strong governance practices.","Circle issues USDC, a stablecoin pegged 1-to-1 to the US dollar, and EURC, which is similarly pegged to the euro.

ECB trims rates: Cuts benchmark rates by 25 bps amid Trump tariff risks; growth path now hinges on trade talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ecb-trims-rates-cuts-benchmark-rates-by-25-bps-amid-trump-tariff-risks-growth-path-now-hinges-on-trade-talks/articleshow/121653174.cms,"ECB President Christine Lagarde (AP)

The European Central Bank lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, citing growing uncertainty from US trade threats and slowing eurozone momentum.In its eighth consecutive rate cut, the ECB reduced its benchmark rate to 2%, down from a recent high of 4%, as policymakers attempt to cushion the eurozone economy from the fallout of renewed trade tensions and sluggish domestic demand.The rate-setting council’s decision, announced at the ECB’s Frankfurt headquarters, comes after US President Donald Trump imposed fresh tariffs on European goods and threatened to raise them sharply in the absence of trade progress. Analysts had widely expected a rate cut, but uncertainty remains over how far the central bank will go in future meetings.According to the Associated Press, ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters that upcoming monetary policy moves would depend heavily on geopolitical developments and the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations. “A further escalation in global trade tensions and associated uncertainties could lower euro area growth by dampening exports and dragging down investment and consumption,” she said. “By contrast, if trade and geopolitical tensions were resolved swiftly, this could lift sentiment and spur activity. ”Lagarde added that higher defence and infrastructure spending, along with productivity-enhancing reforms, could also support growth.European governments have ramped up military procurement in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, partly amid concerns that the US may be pulling back from its commitment to support Kyiv.Despite Thursday’s move, Lagarde said the ECB was “not committing to a particular rate path,” reflecting the fluid outlook for both inflation and growth.The ECB had previously raised rates in 2021–23 to control a post-pandemic inflation spike exacerbated by the Ukraine conflict. With inflation now at 1.9%, just under its 2% target, the bank sees room to provide stimulus through cheaper credit.At the press conference, Lagarde also dismissed speculation from a Financial Times report that she may exit her role early to lead the World Economic Forum in Davos. “I can very firmly tell you that I have always been, and am, fully determined to deliver on my mission, and I’m determined to complete my term,” she said. “So I regret to tell you that you’re not about to see the back of me.” Her term as ECB president runs until October 31, 2027.Trump's recent moves have rattled markets and policymakers across the bloc. The US president imposed a 20% tariff on EU goods and later threatened to double it to 50%, citing slow progress in talks with the EU’s executive commission. While both sides have agreed to hold off implementation and retaliation until July 14, the pause may be short-lived if negotiations stall.Separately, Trump this week raised steel tariffs from 25% to 50% for all countries except the UK, intensifying concerns of a broader global trade slowdown.The European Commission has already revised down its 2025 growth forecast for the region to 0.9%, from 1.3%, based on the assumption that the 20% US tariff might be negotiated down to no more than 10%.","The European Central Bank lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday.

US trade deficit narrows: Trade gap halves in April; China tensions keep outlook uncertain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-trade-deficit-narrows-trade-gap-halves-in-april-china-tensions-keep-outlook-uncertain/articleshow/121653180.cms,"A sharp drop in imports helped narrow the US trade deficit to its lowest in over two years, as sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect across major global markets.The US trade deficit shrank to $61.6 billion in April, falling by more than 55% from March, according to government data released on Thursday. The pullback followed a record-high gap of $138.3 billion in March, when companies rushed to import goods ahead of expected tariff hikes.Imports tumbled 16.3% to $351 billion as Trump’s blanket 10% tariffs on nearly all trading partners came into force. The steepest declines were seen in consumer goods, with pharmaceutical and mobile phone imports dropping significantly.As reported by AFP, the data from the Commerce Department showed that exports in April rose 3% to $289.4 billion, driven by industrial supplies. However, automobile and auto part exports fell by $3.3 billion.Goods from China were most affected, with trade between the world’s two largest economies slowing sharply amid tit-for-tat tariff escalations that pushed levies on both sides past 100%. Shipments from China largely halted in April, before a temporary de-escalation agreement was reached.A phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is now expected to take place, raising hopes of further easing. But the outlook for a long-term trade deal remains unclear. Trump recently accused China of breaching the temporary accord, an allegation Beijing has denied.Alongside the 10% universal tariff, Trump also briefly announced steeper duties on dozens of countries, including the European Union and Japan, before pausing them to allow for negotiations. That pause is set to expire in early July.In addition to global levies, Trump has also imposed targeted tariffs on key sectors. Steel, aluminium, and automobile imports were hit with new duties in March and April, with rates on metals doubled again this month.The trade deficit reported in April was the smallest since early 2023, underscoring the immediate impact of the administration’s protectionist measures.","The US trade deficit shrank to $61.6 billion in April, falling by more than 55% from March.

Analysts say concerns over hiring slowdowns may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this year.Earlier this week, a report by payroll provider ADP showed that private employers added fewer jobs than expected, contributing to pressure on the Fed to act.

The White House did not issue a formal statement.“I just concluded a very good phone call with President Xi,” Trump wrote. “The call lasted approximately one and a half hours and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries.”Trump said the two leaders discussed “some of the intricacies” of their trade deal and confirmed that follow-up meetings between delegations would happen soon. The US team will include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.Trump also noted that Xi had “graciously invited” him and First Lady Melania Trump to visit China, an invitation he said he reciprocated.Notably, Trump added, “Nothing was discussed concerning Russia/Ukraine or Iran.”Chinese state media also highlighted the conversation, quoting Xi as urging the two sides to “correct the course” of their rocky relationship.“Correcting the course of the big ship of Sino-US relations requires us to steer well and set the direction, especially to eliminate all kinds of interference and even destruction, which is particularly important,” Xi said, according to Xinhua.The conversation follows heightened tensions in recent weeks after the US accused China of violating a May truce by restricting exports of critical rare earth minerals. These materials are vital to US manufacturing, especially in the auto and semiconductor sectors. Shortages have triggered fears of production halts in some American factories.In retaliation, the Trump administration proposed revoking visas for certain Chinese students and curbing the sale of high-tech components, including those used in jet engines and semiconductors.Also read: Harvard vs. Trump round two: US blocks foreign students over national security concerns Beijing denied breaking the Geneva agreement and countered that its rare earth controls apply globally, not just to the US. Analysts suggest China is keen on preserving leverage, with Yun Sun of the Stimson Center noting, “The Chinese are reluctant to give up their leverage so easily. They want to wait and see how things go.”The May Geneva talks had temporarily de-escalated a trade war that saw US tariffs on Chinese goods soar to at least 145%, with China responding in kind. The two sides agreed to a 90-day pause, during which negotiators aimed to find long-term solutions.However, on Wednesday, Trump reignited uncertainty by calling Xi “VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!” in a post.While Thursday’s call may help ease immediate tensions, both sides now await the next round of negotiations—this time with trade delegations facing mounting pressure to prevent another economic rupture.","President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on Thursday for the first time since Trump's return to office.

The announcement was made by Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten at the Deutsche Bank Consumer Conference in Paris on Thursday.According to the Associated Press, Schulten described the restructuring as a move to safeguard the company’s long-term growth targets. “This restructuring program is an important step toward ensuring our ability to deliver our long-term algorithm over the coming two to three years,” he said. “It does not, however, remove the near-term challenges that we currently face.”As of June 2024, Procter & Gamble employed approximately 108,000 people worldwide.The layoffs are part of a broader strategy to optimise the company’s global footprint.

Asian stocks mostly rose on Thursday as weaker US economic data raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon cut interest rates, with attention focused on upcoming employment data.Investors are also watching closely for upcoming US jobs data and any updates on possible trade talks between President Trump and China’s Xi Jinping, which White House sources suggest could occur this week.US markets were subdued following an ADP report showing private-sector employment increased by 37,000 in the previous month, significantly below April's 60,000 and falling short of Bloomberg survey predictions.US futures declined slightly alongside oil prices.The Japanese Nikkei 225 decreased by 0.2% to 37,658.46, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 recorded a marginal decline of 0.1% to 8,535.10.The South Korean Kospi surged 2.1% to 2,829.48 as newly appointed president Lee Jae-myung commenced his leadership, pledging to initiate dialogue with North Korea and strengthen trilateral cooperation with the US and Japan.The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.9% to 23,856.54, whilst Shanghai's Composite remained largely stable with a minimal decrease of less than 0.1% to 3,374.30.Early trading in Asia showed gains across Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei and Wellington.

This expectation pushed down Treasury yields.The drop followed a disappointing ADP jobs report, which also triggered a reaction from Donald Trump. On his Truth Social platform, he urged Fed Chair Jerome Powell to act faster, saying, “‘Too Late’ Powell must now LOWER THE RATE.” “He is unbelievable!!!” he added.So far in 2025, the Fed hasn’t lowered rates after cutting them several times in 2024. One reason for holding off is to assess how Trump’s tariffs could impact inflation and economic growth.While lower interest rates may help boost the economy, they also risk driving inflation higher. At the same time, long-term Treasury yields have been rising because investors are concerned about the growing US debt, especially with new tax cuts being discussed in Washington.","US markets were subdued following an ADP report showing private-sector employment increased by 37,000 in the previous month.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “In the words of Elon Musk,” Boyle added, referencing the billionaire and former Trump aide’s criticism of the plan, “this bill is a ‘disgusting abomination.’”The findings land at a critical juncture in the legislative process, as Trump urges Congress to finalize the package by the Fourth of July. The CBO’s assessment, considered a key benchmark for evaluating the fiscal impact of federal legislation, will be closely scrutinized by lawmakers and stakeholders seeking to understand the consequences of the more than 1,000-page proposal.In anticipation of the report, the White House and GOP leaders mounted a pre-emptive critique of the CBO, seeking to cast doubt on its findings. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the CBO has been “historically wrong,” and Senate Majority Leader John Thune argued the agency was “flat wrong” in its projections for Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. The CBO last year said government revenue was 5.6% higher than initially estimated, in part due to pandemic-era inflation spikes.Leavitt also suggested bias among CBO staff, despite the agency’s strict ethics rules that prohibit political activities and campaign contributions to ensure objectivity.Along with the projected costs, the CBO previously estimated that 8.6 million people would lose health coverage and 4 million fewer would receive monthly food stamps due to proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).The bill — dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” echoing one of Trump’s signature catchphrases — is the GOP’s top legislative priority and faces unified Democratic opposition. Democrats, in turn, have labelled it Trump’s “big, ugly bill.”The legislation seeks to extend individual tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul that are set to expire in December unless Congress intervenes. It also introduces new tax measures, including an exemption on taxes for tips. The plan includes a $350 billion increase in funding for border security, deportations, and national defence.To offset some of the lost revenue, Republicans propose phasing out green energy tax credits implemented under President Joe Biden and introducing stricter work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP recipients up to age 65, starting in December 2026.The proposal also includes a Rs 4 trillion increase to the US debt ceiling, currently at Rs 36 trillion, allowing for continued government borrowing. The Treasury has warned that the ceiling must be raised this summer to avoid defaulting on existing obligations.Established in 1974 to serve as Congress’s independent fiscal referee, the CBO is now in its 50th year and employs about 275 economists, analysts, and staff. It was created to provide lawmakers with nonpartisan insights and serve as a counterweight to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.The CBO’s current director, Phillip Swagel, who previously served under Republican President George W. Bush at the Treasury Department, was reappointed in 2023 to a second four-year term.","US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending legislation, now advancing through Congress, will cut taxes by $3.75 trillion.

For example, the average quarterly price increase for 2023 and 2024 was 4 per cent, compared to a 2.8 per cent rise in Q1 this year against Q4 2024,” said Ronan Arthur, MRICS, Director and Head of Residential Valuation at Cavendish Maxwell.“With a weakened US dollar, strong rental returns and appealing yields, Dubai continues to attract local and international property investors.We expect this trend to continue throughout the year,” Arthur added.Off-plan sales led the market with a 70 per cent share, amounting to AED 77.5 billion from 29,000 transactions — a 32 per cent increase year-on-year. Secondary market transactions stood at 13,200, reflecting a 6.6 per cent annual increase.Apartments comprised 75 per cent of all transactions, although interest in larger homes grew. Townhouses accounted for nearly 17 per cent of sales, while villas made up just over 7 per cent.Average property prices reached AED 1,535 per square foot, a 2.8 per cent quarterly increase and 16 per cent higher than in Q1 2024.The luxury segment saw 590 property sales priced above AED 20 million, up from 480 in the same period last year. Nearly 60 of those were for homes priced at AED 50 million or more. Arthur noted that off-plan sales made up 67 per cent of luxury transactions and nearly one-third of ultra-luxury sales.A surge in completions is expected in 2026 and 2027, with over 180,000 units scheduled for delivery.In Q1 2025, Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC) led all locations with 4,330 new units delivered. JVC also saw the highest number of apartment transactions at 3,330 — nearly 2,200 off-plan and 1,132 secondary market deals, reported Arabian Business.Mohammed Bin Rashid City followed with 1,037 units completed, ahead of Business Bay (743), Downtown Jebel Ali (647), and Rukan (636). Looking ahead, JVC is expected to receive almost 27,100 new units by 2028, trailed by Business Bay (19,470), Azizi Venice (17,100), DAMAC Lagoons (10,730), and Arjan (9,750).From January to March, apartments accounted for nearly 80 per cent of all completions. During the same period, 95 projects were launched, delivering around 28,600 new units.DAMAC Islands led off-plan villa and townhouse sales with 1,430 transactions, followed by The Valley, DAMAC Hills 2, Villanova, and DAMAC Lagoons. For secondary market sales in this segment, DAMAC Hills 2 topped the list with 318 deals, ahead of Al Furjan, Emirates Living, Reem, and JVC.Residential rents rose 14.4 per cent annually but showed only 1 per cent growth compared to Q4 2024 — the slowest quarterly rise in two years. “This slower pace of growth could be partly driven by the influx of new units delivered in the first three months of the year, as well as the Dubai Smart Rental Index, introduced at the beginning of the year, which is likely to influence tenant expectations and price adjustments. With additional supply on the way, monitoring how rental trends evolve in response to increasing inventory and a shifting, regulatory framework will be crucial,” Arthur said.As of March 2025, rental yields averaged 7.3 per cent for apartments and 5 per cent for villas and townhouses. Dubai Investments Park offered the highest yields for apartments at 10.3 per cent, followed by International City (9.1%), Downtown Jebel Ali (9%), Dubai Production City (8.6%), Dubai Silicon Oasis (8.5%), Dubai Sports City (8.4%), and Liwan and International City Phase 2 (8.2% each).For villas and townhouses, Industrial City led with yields of 6 per cent, followed by JVC at 5.9 per cent, DAMAC Hills 1 and 2 (5.7%), International City and Serena (5.5%), Mudon and Villa Nova (5.4%), and Dubai Hills Estate (5.3%).","Dubai recorded 42,000 property sales transactions valued at AED 114.4 billion ($31 bn) in the first quarter of 2025.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season.

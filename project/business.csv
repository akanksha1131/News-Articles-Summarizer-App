Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Voltas, Samvardhana Motherson International Ltd, and JK Tyre & Industries Ltd. are the top buy calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for July 10, 2025:Nifty confined in less than half a percent range largely within its previous day’s range - ahead of its weekly expiry due today. With the index closing above its previous resistance of 25470 for 2 consecutive days indicates that the heatedness seen on the index is now out.Retest of bullish pole and flag pattern is also seen on hourly charts of Nifty as the index prepares its next move towards 26000+ with a support seen at 25250 odd. Any dips near the 25450-470 odd mark are likely to get bought into.Bank Nifty as well had an inside bar on daily charts after it closed above its past 3 days high on Tuesday. The index is once again giving confirmation on charts to head back to fresh all time highs. Bank Nifty has been outperforming Nifty from the start of this calendar year. 56900 is now likely to act as a fresh trailing support zone on the index.VOLTAS has ended at the highest point for the current fiscal despite media reports of A/c demand not growing as the markets continue to price in limited downside from current levels on the stock.Technically, the stock has broken out from its 3 month sideways consolidation and is now headed for a 8-10% rally.With MOTHERSON (Samvardhana Motherson International Ltd) giving a fresh crossover above its 200 DMA resistance, on daily charts the pattern suggests a bullish head and shoulder pattern formation along with a short term pole and flag pattern breakout already seen on the same. Momentum is likely to pick up above 160 on the stock.6 week long consolidation is now nearing an end on charts of JKTYRE (JK Tyre & Industries Ltd) as the stock has been on the verge of multiple breakouts. A bullish pole and flag pattern breakout is already confirmed on daily charts while a strong trendline breakout which has been in place for the past 18 months now is now being challenged due to the tailwind thrust by its ongoing breakout.Charts are likely to open up for a larger target once the stock sustains above 385, however for now we are eyeing for a 9-11% style rally from CMP.","Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Voltas, Samvardhana Motherson International Ltd, and JK Tyre & Industries Ltd are the top buy calls for today.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122354627,imgsize-80346,width-400,resizemode-4/122354627.jpg"

Gold Price Outlook

Gold Price Weekly View: Sideways to Downside

Spot Gold could broadly trade in a narrow range of $ 3350 – 3270/oz (CMP $ 3310) till next week as most trade related uncertainties are seen easing now while US macro cues could remain in focus ahead.

On MCX this could translate to a trading range of Rs 97,650 – 95,230 / 10 gm in Aug futures contract.(CMP Rs 96,460 / 10 gm)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates may continue to be range-bound as geopolitical tensions ease and optimism mounts on possible US trade deals with countries on the extension of tariff deadline to August 1, 2025. Over the next few days silver may be the preferred option compared to gold, say experts.Gold price continued to face hurdles near $3350 since last week after the precious metal edged lower since last week as the US June Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report altered the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy expectations.The US NFP came in stronger than expected, rising by 147,000 jobs in June from 144,000 in May (revised from 139,000). Additionally, the Unemployment Rate held steady at 4.1% in June. These reports indicated continued labor market resilience, reducing the possibility of the Fed’s near-term monetary accommodation. This, in turn, underpins the US Dollar (USD) and exerts some selling pressure on the non-yielding assets like Gold.On the other hand, renewed geopolitics saw Israel military attacking Houthi targets at three ports and a power plant in Yemen. Defence Minister Israel Katz confirmed the attack, saying they were carried out due to repeated attacks by the Iranian-backed rebel group on Israel. However the same failed to bring in additional upside in prices.Traders brace for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes later on Wednesday for fresh impetus. Gold traders could also closely monitor the developments surrounding tariff policies amid renewed geopolitical tensions seen in the Middle East.Many major US trading partners are seen hurrying to secure deals, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling reporters on Sunday that country-by-country tariffs will take effect August 1. While an interim accord with India was also expected to be reached, trade related uncertainties are seen easing in weeks ahead.US President Donald Trump’s consistent tariff threats have temporarily muted demand for the yellow metal while supporting the demand for the Greenback. The president has announced new tariffs on countries, with Japan at 25% and South Korea at 30% standing out. He has also given a new deadline, August 1, instead of July 9.Overall broad trend could remain sideways to cautious at higher levels amid Fed meeting minutes due Wednesday night could remain the next major trigger which may also provide clues on timing of rate cuts with most members seen to favor rate cuts starting September.On the other hand, Silver could remain a preferred bet for coming month as compared to gold as Silver-backed ETFs now stand at the highest since mid-2022, after enjoying net inflows for the past eight weeks witnessing the longest run in almost a half-decade","Spot Gold could broadly trade in a narrow range of $ 3350 – 3270/oz (CMP $ 3310) till next week.

Gold and silver price prediction today: Gold rate is exhibiting a short-term bearish trend as its long-term story of being a safe haven remains intact. Where are gold and silver prices headed in the near-term and what levels should investors watch out for?Prices have broken the crucial ₹96,000 support zone, triggering a short-term bearish bias in MCX gold. With that cushion gone, technicals suggest immediate downside targets near ₹94,500 and possibly sliding lower toward ₹94,000 if momentum picks up.Several technical indicators reinforce this negative near-term outlook: gold is trading below its 10 and 21‑period EMAs, the RSI sits under 50, and MACD shows a widening bearish histogram—classic signs of a short-term downtrend . As long as ₹96,000 remains resistant, bears retain control.In markets over the medium-to-long term, gold fundamentals remain favourable. Easing Fed rate pressure, geopolitical uncertainty, and supportive macro trends are expected to propel prices higher over the longer horizon.The bias is negative in the short run—watch ₹94,500–₹94,000 as next support. But on longer timeframes, the positive structural story for gold remains intact.MCX Silver is currently trading near the upper limit of its short-term range—₹109,000—suggesting limited upward momentum and a negative bias.With prices testing resistance, a pullback toward the lower boundary of ₹104,000 appears likely. Once silver retraces to ₹104,000, the down‑leg would likely be complete—paving the way for the broader uptrend to resume.Technically, repeated resistance at ₹109k and rising supply near this zone point to consolidation in the ₹104,000–₹109,000 range. A dip to ₹104k would offer a strategic entry point, aligning with both range play and bullish longer‑term outlook.Expect silver to oscillate within ₹104,000–₹109,000 with a negative short‑term tilt. A pullback toward ₹104k should complete the current down‑leg, setting the stage for the next leg of the longer-term uptrend.","Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views.

Electronics Manufacturing Scheme

Shift From China To Taiwan, South Korea

Indian electronics component manufacturers are fast shifting away from China’s firms. As applications for the electronics component manufacturing scheme approach their deadline, domestic contract manufacturers including Epack Durable, Micromax's Bhagwati Products, Dixon Technologies, PG Electroplast, Amber Enterprises and Optiemus are finalising their proposals, but with a catch!The firms are partnering with South Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese companies as equity stakeholders instead of Chinese firms, according to the CEOs of these Indian companies.This shift is notable because China previously dominated as the primary market for products, parts and business collaborations. The change reflects India's stringent position on Chinese FDI, which requires approval from multiple ministries under Press Note 3 regulations, according to an ET report.Also Read | New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd: Mukesh Ambani-led RIL to group all its FMCG brands under new company; IPO plans in works The Press Note 3 regulations were implemented following the border disputes with China in 2020. Subsequently, only a select few major Chinese enterprises have secured the necessary approvals.The decision also reflects ongoing commercial tensions, exemplified by China's restrictions on rare earth magnet exports to India and other nations.""There is no denying that China is far ahead in large-scale component technology manufacturing, but we are careful about the government stand, as not just the initial investment will need government clearance, but even the subsequent ones. Such clearances will take a lot of time, impact our plans and incentive payout under the scheme,"" said a CEO of one of the largest players in the industry.In cases where technology is available from Taiwan and South Korea, it would be utilised, whilst Chinese dependency remains for other components. Negotiations are underway for technical partnerships or minor equity stakes, a source told the financial daily.Dixon Technologies, the country's leading smartphone contract manufacturer, is currently finalising partnership terms with South Korean and Taiwanese enterprises, according to Managing Director Atul Lall. He indicated potential Chinese collaborations, pending finalisation of terms.Jasbir Singh, CEO of Amber Enterprises, confirmed plans to submit a Rs 4,000 crore proposal under the component manufacturing scheme, with investments spread across the scheme's duration.Also Read | Bold, but difficult mission! How India wants to counter China’s rare earth magnets monopoly - explained Singh, representing India's premier air-conditioner contract manufacturer, detailed plans for two joint applications with Korea Circuit. These include a Rs 3,000 crore proposal for high density interface and semiconductor substrate production, alongside a Rs 1,000 crore initiative for printed circuit board manufacturing.Rajesh Agarwal, director of Bhagwati Products, indicated the company's strategy to pursue equity joint ventures and technical partnerships with Korean, Taiwanese and Chinese organisations, subject to regulatory approvals.The application deadline for the electronics component manufacturing scheme is set to conclude at July end. The initiative, allocated Rs 22,919 crore, spans across six years with an initial gestation period of one year.The programme seeks to establish a robust component ecosystem by drawing substantial investments, enhancing domestic value addition from its current 20% average, and facilitating the integration of Indian firms into global value chains.Official projections indicate anticipated investments of Rs 59,350 crore to generate products worth Rs 4,56,500 crore, creating 91,600 direct jobs and numerous indirect employment opportunities during its duration. The scheme has already garnered over 100 applications.Also Read | ‘Make in India’ success: Chinese smartphone brands bet on India for manufacturing & exports; Indian phonemakers compete for assembly PG Electroplast's MD (operations), Vikas Gupta, confirmed plans to submit 4-5 applications, including partnerships with non-Chinese entities.Optiemus's executive chairman Ashok Gupta indicated their preference for joint ventures with Taiwanese firms.Epack Durable's managing director Ajay DD Singhania revealed plans for two applications totalling Rs 300 crore for sound components, printed circuit board assembly and display. He stated, ""Our first priority is non-Chinese partners from Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.""A CEO highlighted the delicate situation for companies serving Chinese brands, noting that current component suppliers are predominantly Chinese, with some Taiwanese presence. ""Some are Taiwanese too. So, we are talking to the clients too before finalising the applications,"" he said.","The application deadline for the electronics component manufacturing scheme is set to conclude at July end.

Truth Social post

Tariff seen as key revenue source for US government:

US President Donald Trump announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports starting August 1 promising it will help America build a strong copper industry again and enter a “golden age.”In his truth social post, Trump said, ""I am announcing a 50% TARIFF on Copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust NATIONAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT.""Then, pointing to significance of copper he added, ""Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many. Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) “Leaders” decimate this important Industry?""Trump blamed past American leaders for weakening the country’s copper industry, calling them “foolish” and “sleepy.” He said the new tariff would fix what he called the former US President Joe Biden administration’s “stupidity” and help America build a strong copper industry again.“This 50% tariff will reverse the Biden Administration’s thoughtless behaviour and stupidity.” Trump wrote. He promised the move would make America a dominant copper producer once again and it is necessary to protect national security.Trump’s plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper is part of a broader strategy to increase government revenue through tariffs. According to AFP report, Trump told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday: “Today we’re doing copper.I believe the tariff on copper, we’re going to make it 50 percent.”The move adds to existing tariffs the US has placed on imports of steel, aluminum and vehicles. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration has already collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue so far, with hopes of reaching $300 billion by December.Earlier, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the new copper tariff would likely be implemented in late July or on August 1.","US President Donald Trump announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports starting August 1.

Trump's 50% tariffs on copper may not impact India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-50-duty-on-copper-may-not-impact-india/articleshow/122351076.cms,"MUMBAI: The proposed 50% import duty on copper by US President Donald Trump is expected to have minimal impact on India due to its limited exports to America. Hindalco, the nation's largest copper manufacturer, does not send any copper shipments to the US owing to the huge domestic demand. India's copper exports to the US are under $300 million.Copper, used in wires, cables, power transformers and electric motors, sees robust domestic demand, particularly due to the country's focus on renewable energy and electric vehicles, according to industry experts.The annual copper consumption in India is about two million tonnes, while the exports to the US is a mere 30 tonnes.India faces copper resource scarcity, resulting in minimal export volumes, industry experts said. The nation became a copper importer following the shutdown of Vedanta's copper facility in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, in May 2018. During FY25, India's copper imports was about $11 billion.India's copper requirements are projected to double by 2030, prompting the government to modify the MMDR Act and implement a composite licensing system for copper blocks. Since 2015, five copper mineral blocks have been auctioned, with 54 copper exploration projects currently underway nationwide.The domestic copper usage pattern shows building construction at 24%, infrastructure at 19%, industrial sector at 17%, consumer durables at 12%, transportation at 11%, and other sectors at 17%.Industry experts said that US copper consumers will face significant impact, as imports fulfil over 50% of their requirements, primarily sourced from Chile, Canada and Peru.","India faces copper resource scarcity, resulting in minimal export volumes, industry experts said.

"Bypassing China’s critical minerals export ban: US buyers re-routing shipments via Mexico, Thailand, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bypassing-chinas-critical-minerals-export-ban-us-buyers-re-routing-shipments-via-mexico-thailand-says-report/articleshow/122348271.cms,"A sharp rise in US-bound shipments of antimony from Thailand and Mexico has reportedly emerged since China imposed export curbs last year, highlighting how global supply chains are being re-routed to work around geopolitical restrictions.According to customs and shipping data reviewed by Reuters, more than 3,800 metric tons of antimony oxides were imported into the United States from the two countries between December 2024 and April 2025 — more than the total volume brought in over the previous three years combined.Antimony, used in batteries, semiconductors and flame retardants, is among the minerals — along with gallium and germanium — that Beijing blocked from reaching the US in December following Washington’s crackdown on China’s chip industry. The disruption has left the global market scrambling for alternatives, and the data suggests a redirection of Chinese-origin materials through third countries.“Trade flows are being restructured, but we’re still seeing the same underlying sources,” said Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of shipping intelligence firm Publican according to the Reuters report. He noted clear signs of transshipment patterns, though current trade records don’t identify the original source material in all cases.The re-routing comes even as Chinese authorities have acknowledged loopholes. In May, the country’s commerce ministry said foreign players had “colluded with domestic lawbreakers” to bypass the restrictions, adding that curbing such activities was vital to national security. It did not respond to further questions about recent trends.Meanwhile, US law does not prohibit imports of Chinese-origin antimony, gallium or germanium, provided they arrive through licensed intermediaries in other countries.One US buyer, Gallant Metals CEO Levi Parker quoted in the report, described the workaround process in detail: Chinese producers sell the material to buying agents, who then ship it through another Asian country under false labels such as iron or art supplies. “I’d prefer to buy 500 kg per month, but large shipments invite attention,” Parker told Reuters, adding that Chinese logistics firms remain cautious due to the risks.Thai and Mexican exports of antimony to the US have soared since the ban. According to Chinese customs data through May, the two countries have vaulted into the top three destinations for Chinese antimony — despite each having just one smelter and no significant domestic mining output. Mexico’s only smelter resumed operations as recently as April.Among the top exporters is Thai Unipet Industries, a local subsidiary of Chinese antimony producer Youngsun Chemicals. Data from trade platforms ImportYeti and Export Genius shows Unipet sent at least 3,366 tons of antimony-based products to the US between December and May — nearly 27 times its volume over the same period a year earlier.The shipment documents name Unipet as the exporter and Texas-based Youngsun & Essen — a previous direct buyer from China — as the importer. However, Reuters was unable to confirm the origin of the raw material. Unipet did not respond to calls or emails, and Youngsun Chemicals and Youngsun & Essen also did not reply to requests for comment.China launched a new enforcement drive in May aimed at halting illegal mineral transshipment. Offenders can face heavy penalties, including bans and even jail time for severe violations. Chinese law also extends enforcement beyond its borders — companies failing to verify the end use of restricted exports can be prosecuted, said James Hsiao, partner at law firm White & Case.Despite the clampdown, the lure of high overseas prices is keeping the unofficial flow of materials alive. With demand for gallium, germanium and antimony surging, prices for all three minerals have climbed to record highs.“Having policies on paper is one thing, but actually enforcing them on the ground is an entirely different matter,” said Ben Tzion, quoted Reuters.","Thai and Mexican exports of antimony to the US have soared since the ban.

Revenue expectations and challenges

A market giant

Nvidia has officially become the first publicly traded company to cross the $4 trillion mark in market value, a major milestone that underscores the growing influence of artificial intelligence on the global economy.The chip giant’s market cap hit $4.009 trillion as of early Wednesday, pushing it past Microsoft ($3.755 trillion) and Apple ($3.135 trillion). Just two years ago, in July 2023, Nvidia was valued at around $1.05 trillion, making this a staggering fourfold increase in a short span, AP reported.The surge in Nvidia’s value has been driven by an explosion in demand for its AI chips, which now power everything from data centers to advanced research. As per the report by AP, its stock has soared more than 1,000% since the beginning of 2023. A $100,000 investment in the company back then would be worth over $1.1 million today.Despite macroeconomic worries, including potential tariffs and other policies from President Donald Trump, Nvidia and other AI-focused companies have helped lift the S&P 500 to record highs.For the May-July quarter, Nvidia expects revenue to reach around $45 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street projections.However, the company is also facing challenges. US government restrictions on advanced chip exports to China are expected to cost Nvidia about $8 billion in lost sales this quarter.Looking ahead, analysts project Nvidia’s revenue could hit $200 billion for the fiscal year ending January 2026, more than 50% higher than the year before and over three times its revenue from 2024.To put its valuation into perspective: with $4 trillion, one could theoretically buy 4 billion of the latest iPhones. Nvidia’s transformation from a niche graphics card maker to a dominant force in the AI era is now reshaping the future of tech and finance alike.","The chip giant’s market cap hit $4.009 trillion as of early Wednesday.

Rather than visual presentations, Trump opted to dispatch formal letters containing irregular capitalisation, unconventional punctuation and formatting inconsistencies.""It's a better way,"" Trump said of his letters. ""It's a more powerful way. And we send them a letter. You read the letter. I think it was well crafted. And, mostly it's just a little number in there: You'll pay 25%, 35%.

US President Donald Trump is once again escalating the trade war and shaking up the global economy with a sweeping new round of tariffs, this time convinced that the outcome will vindicate him.Just months after his earlier tariff push roiled markets and dented public confidence, Trump is forging ahead with duties as high as 50%, wagering that import taxes will drive US growth, not inflation or slowdown as many economists predict, according to news agency APTrump has sent letters to at least 14 countries announcing tariffs ranging from 25% to 40% on a wide array of goods, with copper and pharmaceutical imports facing new duties of up to 50% and 200% respectively.The deadline for these levies to take effect is August 1 and this time, Trump insists there will be no extensions. “There has been no change to this date, and there will be no change,” he posted on Truth Social.Unlike his “Liberation Day” tariff announcement in April, when abrupt visuals and unclear policy triggers spooked markets, Trump’s latest rollout uses formal letters, albeit riddled with odd formatting, as per AP.Still, the message is clear: there’s little room left for negotiation. “It’s a better way,” Trump told his Cabinet, referring to the letters. “You’ll pay 25%, 35%. We have some of at 60, 70.”The approach reflects Trump’s impatience with traditional diplomacy. “It’s too time-consuming” to negotiate, he claimed, calling past leaders “stupid” for not weaponising tariffs sooner. But this unconventional strategy is drawing warnings at home and abroad.Senator Ron Wyden criticised the uncertainty, saying the “TACO” pattern — “Trump Always Chickens Out” — has paralysed business leaders and foreign governments, unsure whether the threats will materialise. Economists also remain cautious. Cornell’s Wendong Zhang was quoted as saying by AP, “This remains one of the most aggressive and disruptive tariff moves in modern history.”Trump argues the new tariffs will rebalance trade and protect American jobs. “Every case I’m treating them better than they treated us over the years,” he said. Yet many of the targeted nations, including US allies like Japan and South Korea, are scrambling to respond.Some smaller trading partners, such as Tunisia and Laos, have expressed confusion over their inclusion.Despite the sweeping policy shift, markets have so far shown restraint. The Dow Jones dipped 0.4% on Tuesday, and the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%.

Here are other notable highlights from other countries

Argentina made the biggest leap, climbing to 14th thanks to a new minimum wage and improved public happiness.

The UK recovered to 11th after a wage hike and shorter working weeks.

The Netherlands had the shortest average work week at just 30.5 hours.

Finland, Denmark, and Norway dominated the global happiness index.

Austria and Ireland were deemed the safest countries.

The US continued its decline, dropping to 59th, due to zero statutory leave, limited maternity support, and lower safety and inclusivity scores.

Nigeria, with poor healthcare, safety, and long hours, ranked last.

Did you know that only two of the world’s top ten largest economies, Germany and Canada, feature in the top 10 of the Global Life-Work Balance Index 2025? Despite their economic weight, most major economies lag behind smaller nations when it comes to supporting employees with fair leave policies, manageable work hours and access to essential services.Annually published by global HR firm Remote, the report analyses 60 high-GDP countries to assess how well they balance professional obligations with quality of life.Unlike traditional “work-life balance” approaches, this index reverses the emphasis, focusing instead on ""life-work balance"", the idea that life should come first, and work should support rather than dominate it.Using weighted criteria such as statutory paid leave, minimum wage, maternity benefits, healthcare access, safety, LGBTQ+ rights, and working hours, each country was given a score out of 100. The goal is to understand how nations enable people to live and work well, and which ones are falling behind.New Zealand retained its crown as the world’s best place for life-work balance, improving its score by 6 points from 2024. With generous paid leave, universal healthcare, and strong public safety, the country also saw a minimum wage bump that boosted its ranking.Ireland ranked second with strong maternity policies, a well-funded healthcare system, and an above-average minimum wage.Its performance was helped by a high safety rating and stable working hours.Belgium came in third with a reliable public insurance model, competitive wages, and over 30 paid leave days annually. High inclusivity and good safety metrics added to its score.Germany, ranked fourth, offers solid statutory leave, high wages, and excellent healthcare through a mixed system. It also scores well on inclusivity and working hours.Norway jumped into fifth place, the highest among Nordic countries. Extended parental leave and low working hours helped boost its life-work balance score significantly this year.Denmark, just behind Norway, continued to perform strongly on happiness and healthcare. Although it does not have a statutory minimum wage, collective agreements ensure high worker welfare.Canada, ranked seventh, offers universal healthcare and good safety ratings. While its paid leave is comparatively lower (17 days), it compensates with inclusivity and legal protections.Australia, at eighth, combines high wages and short work hours with solid maternity benefits. However, its healthcare is partially private, slightly lowering its score.Spain secured ninth with the highest number of paid leave days in the top 10. Despite longer work hours, strong healthcare and safety ensured a good ranking.Finland rounded off the top 10, leading the world in happiness while offering universal healthcare and excellent public services, even though minimum wages are not legally mandated.India ranked 42nd out of 60, scoring just 45.81. While it offers 35 days of statutory leave and 100% paid maternity benefits, major gaps exist in healthcare access, safety, LGBTQ+ rights, and overall happiness.With average weekly work hours at 45.72, among the highest globally, and low public investment in employee wellbeing, India struggles to match leading nations.The 2025 Life-Work Balance Index analysed data from the top 60 GDP nations using metrics such as:Each metric was given a weight based on relevance, and countries were assigned an overall score out of 100. Lower scores in hours worked and safety rankings were considered better, while higher values in leave, inclusivity, and pay improved scores.","New Zealand retained its crown as the world’s best place for life-work balance, improving its score by 6 points from 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

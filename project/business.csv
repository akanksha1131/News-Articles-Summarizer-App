Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday as the December 2025 futures contract climbed to Rs 1,70,415 per kilogram. This marks an increase of Rs 1,977 or 1.18% for the day.The surge in silver prices has resulted in a remarkable 19.8% gain for the month of October, rising from a closing price of Rs 1,42,145 on September 30. This significant monthly increase highlights strong festive demand and growing industrial interest in the metal.The recent rally has sparked renewed interest in silver's long-term potential, with analysts attributing the uptrend to solid underlying fundamentals. Mahendra Patil, Founder and Managing Partner at MP Financial Advisory Services LLP (MPFASL), noted that silver is experiencing ""a phase of structural endurance rather than speculative exuberance"", as quoted by Economic Times.Patil pointed out that while silver has historically been volatile, its past performance offers valuable insights. The metal previously approached the $50 per ounce mark in 1980 and 2011, and with 2025 marking its third such approach, the focus is now on whether it can maintain sustained momentum.In 2025, silver prices surged from $29 to over $47 per ounce, reaching ""its highest level in more than a decade."" MPFASL attributes this momentum to several factors, including ""higher expectations from US rate cuts, sustained central-bank buying, and industrial restocking across solar and electronics supply chains.""Highlighting silver's dual appeal, Patil said, ""Silver is gaining ground as both a symbolic and practical substitute. Beyond its decorative appeal, the industrial demand linked to solar panels, electronics, and electric mobility provides fundamental support to prices, creating a dual-use demand base that gold lacks.""The rise in silver demand is not limited to global markets. In India, silver imports have increased significantly. ""Silver imports have expanded, reflecting its growing relevance as an industrial and investment metal within the renewable-energy and electronics value chains,"" MPFASL reported.Data from the firm also revealed that silver delivered an annualized return of 32.92% in the CY2023–CY2025 period, with a volatility of 24.66%, based on historical performance. The correlation between gold and silver during this period stood at 0.95, indicating closely linked price movements, although silver's trajectory has increasingly been driven by industrial factors.Looking ahead, MPFASL suggests that silver may continue to benefit from its industrial underpinnings. ""Silver exceeded expectations, crossing $47 per ounce on renewed industrial restocking in solar and electronics,"" the report noted.Most projections indicate that silver is expected to remain in the $44–50 per ounce range through FY2026. While gold may experience consolidation, ""silver amplified the momentum as the cyclical bellwether of a broader industrial revival.""As India enters the festive season and global industrial restocking continues, the metal's trajectory will likely depend on sustained demand from the electronics and renewable sectors. MPFASL adds that silver's ability to surpass the $50 per ounce mark may depend on whether it can ""finally build sustained momentum and move toward the next big landmark, its metaphorical 'century.'""For domestic traders, Rs 1,70,415 now serves as a key resistance level on MCX. With industrial and festive tailwinds in play, attention will remain on whether silver can build upon this rally or consolidate near its current highs.","Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday.

The dilemma on festival dates

Muhurat Trading 2025: A blend of tradition and finance



Remaining stock market holidays for the year





As Diwali approaches, many are uncertain whether the festival falls on October 20 or 21 this year. As for stock markets, investors would also like to know definitive dates of the days when trading will not happen. They have a definitive date to note: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.However, on October 21, a special trading activity will occur which is the traditional Muhurat Trading session, a symbolic ritual lasting one hour, from 1:45 PM to 2:45 PM. This session will allow trading across various segments, including equities, futures and options, currency and commodity derivatives, and securities lending and borrowing (SLB), with modifications permitted until 2:55 PM.The confusion arises because the lunar calendar's Amavasya tithi, or new moon phase, technically extends into October 21. However, the auspicious time for Lakshmi Puja is on the evening of October 20, leading most households to celebrate then. The following day marks the start of the new Hindu Samvat year, celebrated with the Muhurat Trading session on Dalal Street.This year, the Muhurat session will occur in the afternoon on October 21, a departure from recent years when it was held in the evening.Additionally, markets are closed on October 18 for Dhanteras and October 19 for the regular weekend schedule.Muhurat Trading, meaning ""auspicious hour,"" is more than just a market event. It symbolizes the beginning of Samvat 2082, the new Hindu financial year. For investors, it represents optimism and a prayer for prosperity rather than a focus on profits.This tradition has persisted for decades, often bringing positive returns. The Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the past 18 Muhurat sessions. Even during the 2008 global financial crisis, the index rose by 5.86% during the session. In 2024, it gained 335 points, or 0.42%, continuing the trend of festive cheer.Analysts, as quoted by ET, point out that trading volumes are typically low during this one-hour window, leading to potential volatility. However, the session is not seen as a typical trading day but rather a symbolic reset, where traders, families, and brokers come together to mark a hopeful start to the new year.After October 22, only two more holidays remain for stock markets part from the regular Saturdays and Sundays. Markets will be shut on November 5 for Prakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev and December 25 for Christmas"," Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.

Gold price prediction: Where are gold prices headed in the near term? Why investors should not chase the rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-october-21-2025-and-in-the-near-term-diwali/articleshow/124714972.cms,"Gold may see some correction ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports to be released on October 24 as hot inflation data may hurt December cut chances. (AI image)

Gold Performance:

On October 20, spot gold, despite easing US-China trade tensions and subsiding bad loan concerns involving US regional banks, quickly reversed its nearly 0.75% decline to $4219 in the Asian session to rise sharply to $4355 in the US session. Bad loan concerns eased as the US regional banks posted encouraging results.

Although on October 20, Trump threatened China with 155% tariff rate if no deal by November 1, gold had already rallied to its session’s high by then.

At the time of writing this article, spot gold was trading with a gain of 2.11% at $4345. The MCX December gold contract was changing hands at 103,443, up 2.70% for the day.

Earlier, the yellow metal extended its weekly winning streak to the ninth consecutive week as it closed with a weekly gain of nearly 5.75% at $4251 in the week ending October 17.

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Data roundup:

Chinese data on October 20 were largely encouraging as Q3 GDP at 4.8% annualized rate came in line with the forecast, while industrial production at 2.9% and retail sales data at 6.5% topped their respective forecasts of 3% and 5%.

US-China talks:

US Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng will have the next round of trade talks next week in Malaysia, which will prepare ground for presidential meetings.

US President is set to meet with Chinese President Xi in South Korea in a couple of weeks. Trump has listed rare earths, fentanyl and soybeans as top US issues with China. He wants China to resume soybean purchases

Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index was noted at 98.52, up nearly 0.10% for the day.

Ten-year US yields were hovering around 2.99%, while two-year yields at 3.46% were up by nearly one-bps.

Gold ETF holdings and COMEX stocks:

As of October 17, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 98.23 MOz, a new cycle high, as holdings rose for the seventh straight week.

Gold ETF holdings have recorded a net inflow of 15.38 MOz YTD, which amounts to a net inflow of 478 tons this year so far.

Of late, huge ETF inflow has played a crucial role in pushing up gold prices.

COMEX gold stocks stand at 39.10 MOz, a decline of 13.26% from the record inventory level of 45.07 MOz noted in April.

China's fourth plenum:

The Chinese Communist Party is holding the fourth plenary session of its 20th central committee in a four-day closed-door meeting from October 20 to 23. A proposal of the CCP Central Committee on formulating the 15th five-year plan for National and Social Development will be discussed at the plenum and if approved, it will be approved at the 'Two Sessions' - China's annual parliamentary and political consultative meetings - in March 2026.

Upcoming data:

Major US data on deck this week include Philadelphia Fed non-manufacturing activity (October 21), weekly job data (October 23), existing home sales (October 23), CPI (October 24), S&P global US PMIs (October 24), University of Michigan sentiment and inflation expectations (October 24). Some of the data may get delayed due to the ongoing partial shutdown of the US government.

Eurozone's PMIs will be out on October 24.

Focus will be mainly on the US CPI data as traders try to assess the Fed’s monetary policy trajectory. Hot inflation data will affect rate cut chances.

Gold Price Outlook:

Given the fact that both equities and gold have been rallying mostly together, the current gold rally is driven mostly by ETF inflows and late buyers as traders focus on the FOMC monetary policy decision due on October 29 wherein the Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 bps. It is to be noted that both markets and the Fed expect two more rate cuts by the year-end with the next rate cut to take place in December.

US-China tensions may also be driving the rally as China has yet to make its stand clear, though risk assets remain well bid.

Trump’s China threats on Monday did not dent the risk sentiments.

Gold may see some correction ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports to be released on October 24 as hot inflation data may hurt December cut chances as October rate cut is almost a done deal.

In the near-term, gold is expected to be highly volatile due to US-China headlines.

Buying the dips is preferred over chasing the rally at this point, though the metal may quickly surge to $4500 in case US-China tensions escalate.

Support is at $4200/$4116/$4000. Resistance is at $4400/$4500.

We look for a target of $5000 in a year’s timeframe.

Silver: Buy the dips



Performance:

At the time of writing this article, spot silver was trading with a gain of 0.50% at $52.17.

Spot silver closed with a weekly gain of 3.42% at 51.92 in the week ending October 17 as it extended its weekly winning streak to the ninth straight week, which mirrors the gold’s streak.

Silver, supported by an extremely tight market due to ETF led demand, has rallied over 40% since August 1 as it hit a fresh record high of $54.47 on October 17.

Global Silver ETF holdings:

Silver ETF holdings stand at 823.23 MOz as holdings slid from cycle high of 833.41 MOz as noted on October 14.

Total known silver ETF holdings have risen 15.26% YTD as ETF inflows this year amount to a net inflow of 3,390 tons of silver.

Silver is now the largest cost component in a solar module production

After steep price increase, silver is now the largest cost component in solar module production as it overtook aluminum and PV glass. As per Bloomberg calculation, current silver price translates to over 17% of the per-watt price of solar modules.

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver may see profit booking ahead of the US CPI and PMI reports. However, overall, outlook remains constructive.

Considering the steep rise in silver prices since August 1, it is advisable to buy the dips rather than chase the rally.

Support is at $50.62/$50/$46. Resistance is at $55/$56.10.

If risk appetite remains reasonably healthy, silver may rise to $56/$58 level by the year-end.

We expect the metal to reach $75-$100 in next three to five years as we look for a target of $60-$65 in a year’s timeframe.

'System spammed with fraud': White House' latest justification on H-1B visa fee hike; calls move 'lawful',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/system-spammed-with-fraud-white-house-latest-justification-on-h-1b-visa-fee-hike-calls-move-lawful/articleshow/124774915.cms,"H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy





The Donald Trump-led administration is preparing to defend its new H-1B visa policy in court after multiple lawsuits were filed against the $100,000 fee imposed on new visa applicants.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday (local time) said the administration would fight the legal challenges, arguing that the H-1B system has been misused for years and that the new policy aims to protect American workers.""The administration will fight these lawsuits in court. The president's main priority has always been to put American workers first and to strengthen our visa system. For far too long, the H-1B visa system has been spammed with fraud, and that's driven down American wages. So the president wants to refine this system, which is part of the reason he implemented these new policies. These actions are lawful, they are necessary, and we'll continue to fight this battle in court,"" Leavitt told reporters at the White House briefing.Her comments came after the US Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the administration’s decision, calling the $100,000 visa fee unlawful.Several other groups, including unions, employers, and religious organisations, have also filed lawsuits in federal courts in California and Washington, DC, arguing that the new fee violates immigration law and harms US industries.The Chamber’s petition says the new rule overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires visa fees to reflect the actual cost of processing applications.""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which Congress created expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the US,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and Chief Policy Officer at the US Chamber of Commerce.Bradley added that while President Trump’s overall economic policies have encouraged investment, the new visa fee could make it harder for businesses to find the workers they need.""President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unravelling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,"" he said.A coalition of unions, educators, and religious groups has also filed another major lawsuit against the visa fee, calling it ""arbitrary and capricious.""The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. The increased fee is expected to heavily impact the technology sector, particularly Indian IT professionals, who make up the largest group of H-1B recipients.The new $100,000 annual fee is a steep jump from the current H-1B processing costs, which are typically a few thousand dollars. Companies will pay this in addition to existing vetting charges, and the administration is still deciding whether to collect the full amount upfront or annually.The US Chamber of Commerce has warned that the high fee could force companies to reduce or abandon their use of the H-1B program altogether. Tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are among those likely to be affected.","Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the $100,000 fee imposed on new H-1B visa applicants. US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the administration’s decision. Several other groups, including unions, employers, and religious organisations, have also filed lawsuits in federal courts in California and Washington.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124775394,imgsize-988404,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices sustained their bullish trajectory for the fourth consecutive week, propelled by robust global market cues and strong Q2FY26 earnings momentum. Additionally, renewed optimism surrounding the advanced stages of India–US trade pact negotiations further underpinned investor sentiment and amplified risk-on appetite across equities.The Nifty extended its winning streak for the sixth consecutive session on Thursday, closing at a fresh 52-week high near the 25,900 marks. However, it’s noteworthy that after a sharp 1,500-point rally over the past four weeks, the stochastic oscillator on both daily and weekly charts has entered the overbought zone. This suggests the potential for a short-term consolidation or corrective pause at higher levels — a healthy development that could set the stage for the next leg of the uptrend.Given the prevailing global volatility and the ongoing earnings season, any dip from current levels should be viewed as a buying opportunity to accumulate fundamentally robust counters with strong earnings visibility. On the downside, the zone of 25,500–25,700 is expected to act as a strong demand area, coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the ongoing rally (24,587–25,782) and the recent breakout region — thus providing a solid technical support base.Our constructive outlook is further reinforced by the following developments: After the strong performances in the Auto and Metal sectors, the Bank Nifty has now registered a fresh all-time high, signaling renewed sectoral strength. This broad-based participation is expected to lend additional momentum to the benchmark Nifty, potentially propelling it towards 26,277 — the prior all-time high — and subsequently to 26,600 in the coming month, which represents the measured move target derived from the breakout of the three-month symmetrical triangle consolidation pattern.Key Factors to Monitor Going Forward:Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows in all time frames. The index during the week has rallied to a fresh all-time high of 58577 levels.Going forward, the index is expected to sustain its upward trajectory, with immediate support placed at 57,500-57600 levels being the last week breakout area and a stronger demand zone seen near 56,800-56,500 levels.On the higher side, resistance is envisaged around 59000 levels being the 138.2% retracement of the entire previous decline (57628-53561).From an oscillator perspective, the Stochastic indicator has reversed upward and is nearing the overbought territory, suggesting a possible phase of consolidation with a positive undertone.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling supply line joining highs of the last 2-3 months signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is seen sustaining above the 20- & 50-days EMA highlighting short term momentum returning in the stock. It has immediate support at current week low of 144.We expect the stock to move higher towards 168 levels in the coming month being the 50% retracement of the entire decline of last 4 months (198-136)The stock is forming base at the 80% retracement of the previous major up move of May-June 2025 and has witnessed a shallow retracement of its previous up move signaling overall positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to resume its move and head towards 380 levels in the coming month being the confluence of the 200 day EMA and 50% retirement of the previous decline (417-337).Among the oscillators the daily 14 periods RSI is in up move and is sustaining above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 24, 2025 are Inox Wind, and Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services. Nifty extended its winning streak for the sixth consecutive session on Thursday, closing at a fresh 52-week high near the 25,900 marks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124775473,imgsize-77164,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday (local time) claimed that India had scaled back Russian oil imports at US President Donald Trump 's ""request"" and China was doing the same.""If you read the sanctions and look at them, they're pretty hefty. I saw some international news out of China this morning that they're scaling back oil purchases from Russia.

NEW DELHI: India’s consumer and retail sector witnessed a decisive rebound in the Sept quarter, with deal volumes rising to 132 and values crossing $3.4 billion, nearly four times higher than previous quarter.The recovery was led by renewed investor focus on textiles, apparel and accessories, and sustained activity in food processing and e-commerce , Grant Thornton Bharat’s Q3 2025 Consumer and Retail Dealtracker report showed.A total of 97 PE/VC deals worth $1.3 billion were registered during the third quarter, more than doubling in value QoQ. Investors focused on festive-led categories — apparel, e-commerce, and consumer electronics — with notable rounds for VIP Industries, Zepto, Jumbotail, and Miko, it said.The quarter also witnessed a revival of outbound M&A, with Indian consumer players pursuing cross-border acquisitions to expand product portfolios and strengthen global footprints. There were 24 M&A deals worth $955 million, led by domestic consolidation in food processing and apparel. Big-ticket transactions such as Tilaknagar’s acquisition of Pernod Ricard’s Imperial Blue and Titan’s purchase of Damas Jewellery anchored the rebound, while outbound activity revived with five cross-border acquisitions.With policy tailwinds and festive demand, investor confidence remains strong across consumption-linked sectors. Six IPOs and five QIPs raised over $1.1 billion, led by Urban Company, Bluestone Jewellery, Tilaknagar, and Lenskart, reflecting renewed investor appetite for consumer names.

MUMBAI: Priya Nair, who took over as HUL’s MD & CEO on Aug 1, has her task cut out — driving volume-led growth at the FMCG company that has grappled with subdued demand environment and sluggish volumes over the past several quarters.Nair has taken charge from Rohit Jawa amid an improving broader macro-economic scenario — food inflation is low, policy boost through rate cuts, income tax benefits and GST reductions are likely to shore up demand for a host of consumer goods — from shampoos to cookies and jams.In it Q2 earnings briefing on Thursday, HUL said that these factors along with the firm’s growth strategy equips it well to “accelerate volume-led growth in the mid-to-long term”, even as some temporary GST-led market disruptions impacted sales in the Sept quarter.Nair is also sharpening focus on consumer approach amid rapidly changing consumption patterns — HUL will leverage its reach across “price pyramid” to create different strategies for different consumer classes. For instance, the ways of targeting an affluent consumer through the build of its products, advertising and channel mix will be distinct from the way it will reach the masses. “Our focus will be to continuously, radically segment consumers.India is emerging with clear consumer cohorts,” Nair said at her first media interaction after assuming office in Aug.HUL’s revenue from operations was flat year-on-year on a standalone basis in the Sept quarter at Rs 15,585 crore. Net profits increased 3% to Rs 2,690 crore in Q2 on the back of one-off gains from resolution of prior years’ tax matters between Indian and UK authorities.GST disruptions will ease from early Nov, said HUL. The company is betting on GST cuts to boost volume growth and spur demand, allowing people to premiumise.Nair, who moved back to Mumbai from London after over three years, has been meeting consumers and spending time with stakeholders.

MUMBAI: Geopolitical tensions pose a growing threat to cross-border payments, RBI said in its latest report on payments. The central bank warned that the global financial system’s dependence on centralised infrastructure and a few dominant settlement currencies makes it vulnerable to international conflict and sanctions.According to RBI, sanctions or restrictions on financial systems or currencies can disrupt markets and limit access to essential financial services. Geopolitical tensions can also create operational barriers, slowing transactions and reducing certainty in settlements. These risks, the report said, are already prompting countries to explore alternative arrangements to secure financial flows.RBI noted that countries facing geopolitical strains are increasingly developing bilateral or multilateral alternatives to existing payment systems. India, it said, is actively participating in efforts to build more resilient networks. Among these is Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative with Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand that seeks to interlink domestic fast payment systems for instant cross-border retail transfers.The report also highlighted India’s operational linkage between UPI and Singapore’s PayNow, launched in 2023, which enables instant and low-cost person-to-person transfers. While such initiatives aim to make payments faster and cheaper, the RBI said they also serve a strategic goal — diversifying payment routes and reducing dependence on legacy systems that could be weaponized by geopolitical forces.",RBI: Geopolitical tensions pose a growing threat to cross-border payments.

(AI image)

Dhanteras 2025:

But will this rally continue? Are gold and silver good investment bets over the next year? We ask experts what the gold and silver price outlook is and what levels will they hit by Dhanteras 2026:

Dhanteras 2025: Should you buy gold and silver this year?

What’s the gold price outlook till next Dhanteras?

Gold — Diwali/Dhanteras 2026 target: ₹1,40,000–₹1,45,000+ Bull case 160000+ if geopolitical risk escalates or Fed turns very dovish. For the 12-month horizon to Dhanteras 2026, maintaining the bullish structural view, expect upside if the macro tailwinds persist — Fed cuts, weak dollar, tariffs/ geopolitical premium.Since the price has shown sharp up move recently, its advisable to allocate in dips and parts.

Silver — Dhanteras/Diwali 2026 target: ₹1,85,000–₹2,10,000/kg; Bull case ₹2,20,000–₹2,50,000+ on stronger industrial demand Central banks buying and continued ETF flows.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Thursday pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty of enabling money laundering while leading the cryptocurrency exchange.“President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.“In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,” she added, as quoted by CNBC News.The pardon caps a monthslong effort by Zhao, a billionaire commonly known as CZ in the crypto world and one of the biggest names in the industry. He and Binance have been key supporters of some of the Trump family's crypto enterprises.Zhao expressed his gratitude on social media Thursday, saying, “Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice.”Zhao had pleaded guilty in November 2023 in Seattle federal court and agreed to step down as Binance CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement by the company with the Department of Justice.He was charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to “implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating US economic sanctions ‘in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the US market without implementing controls required by US law,’” the DOJ said.Binance had also been charged with conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Powers Act, and conspiracy.Zhao was sentenced in April 2024 to just four months in jail, although federal prosecutors had requested a three-year sentence.“The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career. These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States’ reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden Administration’s war on crypto is over,” said Leavitt.The pardon comes two months after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family’s own crypto venture, which has generated about $4.5 billion since the 2024 election, was aided by “a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform quietly administered by Binance.”","Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 in Seattle federal court.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday admitted that the latest round of US sanctions under President Donald Trump were “serious” and would have “certain consequences” for Russia, though he insisted they would not cripple the economy.“They (sanctions) are serious for us, of course, that is clear. And they will have certain consequences, but they will not significantly impact our economic well-being,” Putin told reporters. He described the sanctions as an “unfriendly act” that “does not strengthen Russia-US relations, which have only just begun to recover.”The Trump administration today imposed what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called “massive sanctions” against Russia’s energy sector, directly targeting state oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil. The move came after months of appeals from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and bipartisan pressure in Washington to strike at the heart of Moscow’s war financing.Bessent said the measures were aimed at cutting off “the Kremlin’s war machine” and urged allies to follow suit. “We encourage our partners to join us and adhere to these sanctions,” he said.Trump, speaking shortly after the announcement, said he hoped the sanctions would push Putin to the negotiating table.“Hopefully he’ll become reasonable,” Trump said. “And hopefully Zelenskyy will be reasonable, too. You know, it takes two to tango, as they say.”The sanctions were unveiled as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte met Trump in Washington. Rutte said the decision was “exactly the type of action we needed,” crediting US-made air defence systems with helping Ukraine repel recent Russian attacks.Moscow’s reaction, however, has been furious. Former President Dmitry Medvedev called the move “an act of war,” accusing Washington of abandoning diplomacy. “The United States is our adversary,” he wrote on Telegram, claiming Trump had “fully embarked on the warpath against Russia.”","Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that the latest round of US sanctions under President Donald Trump were “serious” and would have “certain consequences” The Trump administration today imposed what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called “massive sanctions” against Russia’s energy sector, directly targeting state oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil.

How OnlyFans beat Nvidia and Apple to become the world’s most revenue-efficient company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-onlyfans-beat-nvidia-and-apple-to-become-the-worlds-most-revenue-efficient-company/articleshow/124766188.cms,"What OnlyFans does and how it works



Revenue efficiency and financial performance

User and creator expansion

The business model behind the numbers



Market leadership and ownership gains





OnlyFans has officially outpaced global tech titans to claim the title of the world’s most revenue-efficient company, according to data from financial and marketing analytics firm Barchart. The UK-based content subscription platform, best known for enabling creators from fitness trainers and musicians to adult performers to monetise exclusive content directly from fans, generates an astonishing $37.6 million in revenue per employee. Operating with a lean workforce of just 42 employees, OnlyFans has surpassed giants like Nvidia ($3.6 million) and Apple ($2.4 million) by a massive margin. In fiscal year 2024, the company reported $1.41 billion in net revenue from a $7.22 billion transaction volume, cementing its dominance in the creator-driven digital economy.OnlyFans operates as a subscription-based content platform where creators earn directly from their fan base. Fans pay a monthly fee to access exclusive material, which can include fitness tutorials, cooking demonstrations, lifestyle vlogs, music previews, or adult-oriented photos and videos, depending on the creator’s niche.The platform also allows direct interaction between creators and subscribers through private messages, pay-per-view posts, live streams, and personalised content requests.This level of communication gives subscribers a sense of exclusivity and connection, making OnlyFans more personal than most social media platforms.Unlike traditional media or entertainment companies, OnlyFans does not produce any content itself. Instead, it serves as an intermediary, providing the infrastructure, payment systems, and compliance framework that enable creators to monetise their work safely and directly. The company earns a 20 percent commission from creator earnings, while creators retain 80 percent, keeping both sides financially motivated.With over 4.6 million creators and 377 million registered users, OnlyFans has built one of the most profitable ecosystems in the global creator economy, blending community, creativity, and commerce.However, critics argue that the platform’s success is closely tied to its adult content market, which accounts for much of its traffic and revenue. This association has led to ongoing debates about content moderation, exploitation risks, and regulatory oversight. While the company positions itself as a hub for all types of creators, its reputation as an adult content platform has made it difficult to attract mainstream advertisers and diversify beyond that niche. Some analysts also warn that its reliance on independent creators makes it vulnerable to changes in user habits, government regulations, or payment processor restrictions.According to Barchart’s report, OnlyFans ranks far ahead of the world’s largest technology companies in revenue per employee, a measure of how effectively a company turns its workforce into profit. Its reliance on user-generated content and minimal operational overhead has resulted in exceptional financial efficiency.For the fiscal year ending November 2024, OnlyFans recorded $7.22 billion in gross payments from fans to creators, retaining $1.41 billion in revenue after payouts. That marks an 8 percent increase year-on-year, while pre-tax profit rose 4 percent to $684 million, and net profit after tax reached $520 million. Despite slower growth compared to its triple-digit expansion in 2021, OnlyFans continues to post consistent, debt-free profits, a rare achievement in the tech industry.While revenue growth has stabilised, engagement on the platform continues to rise. Creator accounts grew by 13 percent to 4.63 million, and fan accounts rose by 24 percent to 377.5 million during the 2024 fiscal year. This steady expansion demonstrates OnlyFans’ ability to maintain relevance in a highly competitive digital landscape.Creators collectively earned about $5.8 billion in 2024, while OnlyFans kept its 20 percent share, reinforcing a business model that rewards creators while ensuring strong platform profitability. The mutual benefit between platform and user has been central to OnlyFans’ sustained success.OnlyFans’ strength lies in its asset-light, platform-first model. By outsourcing content production to independent creators, the company avoids the costs of creative teams, studios, and large-scale product development.

‘You Don’t Talk About Russia China Ties’: Beijing Rebukes EU Over Latest Sanctions | Watch





China on Thursday strongly criticised the latest US sanctions imposed on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, calling the move ""unilateral"" and ""lacking any basis in international law. ""Addressing a daily press briefing in Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, “China consistently opposes unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law and are not authorised by the United Nations Security Council .”The sanctions were announced by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday after plans for a fresh summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin collapsed. Trump said talks with Putin “don’t go anywhere.”China, a major trading partner of Russia, has maintained a neutral stance on the war in Ukraine and has refrained from condemning Moscow’s 2022 full-scale invasion.Guo also criticised sanctions agreed by the European Union the same day, which targeted several Chinese companies. He said Beijing was “strongly dissatisfied,” as quoted by AFP.“China is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it,” Guo said. “The European side is in no position to make irresponsible remarks about the normal exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and Russian enterprises,” he added.He urged Brussels to “stop making an issue out of China,” adding that Beijing “will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”Responding to Trump’s comment that Chinese President Xi Jinping could have a “big influence” on Putin in efforts to end the war, Guo said, “Dialogue and negotiations are the only feasible way out of the Ukraine crisis.”The latest sanctions on major Russian oil firms are also expected to make it almost impossible for India to continue buying crude from Russia.","China strongly criticised the latest US sanctions imposed on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC.

Impact on corporate sponsors and educational institutions







The United Kingdom has announced fresh hikes for in-country expedited immigration services, effective October 21, Tuesday, continuing a trend of significant hikes over the past two years.Expedited processing of sponsorship management requests for worker, temporary worker, or student sponsors now costs GBP 350, up 75% from GBP 200. Meanwhile, priority service for sponsor licence applications has increased to GBP 750, a 50% rise from GBP 500, reported ET.The fee changes apply specifically to expedited and priority applications, while standard processing fees remain unchanged. The updates come amid broader increases affecting Certificates of Sponsorship, skilled worker and visit visa applications, and the upfront immigration health surcharge.No immediate exemptions have been announced, meaning the changes affect both corporate sponsors and educational institutions handling visa requests.According to Fragomen, recent fee hikes reflect an ongoing effort by UK authorities to streamline immigration processes while funding faster adjudication of applications.The fee increases are part of the UK’s broader strategy to remain competitive in attracting skilled international workers while managing administrative costs.Companies and educational institutions may need to reassess their immigration strategies to accommodate higher fees and potentially longer processing times.Starting in 2026, UK universities will align tuition fees with inflation, contingent upon meeting stringent quality standards. This policy aims to stabilise university finances while ensuring value for money for students.Institutions maintaining high standards in teaching, student outcomes, and support services will be eligible for annual fee increases linked to inflation.Maintenance loans will also be adjusted annually, with increased support for low-income households. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said underperforming institutions could face regulatory or financial penalties, reinforcing the government’s commitment to maintaining high standards across the higher education sector.","The fee changes apply specifically to expedited and priority applications, while standard processing fees remain unchanged.

Russia has reacted furiously to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new sanctions on its oil sector, with former President Dmitry Medvedev calling the move “an act of war” and accusing Washington of abandoning diplomacy.In a post on Telegram, Medvedev denounced Trump’s decision to sanction Russia’s two biggest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, and to cancel a planned summit with Vladimir Putin in Budapest. “The United States is our adversary,” he wrote, “and their talkative ‘peacemaker’ has now fully embarked on the warpath against Russia.”Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, described the measures as proof that Trump had “fully aligned himself with insane Europe” and declared that the decisions “are an act of war against Russia.” He added that Trump’s choices revealed the United States was no longer merely supporting Kyiv, but had made the conflict “his war now, not the senile Biden’s.”The outburst followed Washington’s announcement of what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as “massive sanctions” on Russia’s energy sector, aimed at choking off funding for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “We will continue to take necessary actions to degrade the Kremlin’s war machine,” Bessent said, urging allies to adopt similar measures.Trump, meanwhile, expressed hope that the sanctions would push Putin to negotiate. “Hopefully he’ll become reasonable,” the president said, adding, “It takes two to tango, as they say.”The sanctions mark the first time the Trump administration has directly targeted Russia’s main oil companies, after months of appeals from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and pressure from Congress. They coincide with fresh Russian missile and drone attacks across Ukraine that left at least six dead, including a mother and her two children.NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who met Trump in Washington shortly before the sanctions were unveiled, welcomed the move, saying, “It is exactly the type of action we needed.”For Moscow, however, the measures have triggered an escalation in rhetoric. Medvedev mocked Trump’s oscillating approach toward Russia and Ukraine, saying it was another swing of the “Trump pendulum” that now allows him “to pound all of Bandera’s hiding places with a variety of weapons.” He accused the US of destroying rather than negotiating, declaring that Washington had chosen to “destroy enemies, not make meaningless deals. ”The sanctions also come after a week of uncertainty in Trump’s foreign policy. Plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest collapsed after the Kremlin refused to alter its stance on Ukraine, while the White House confirmed there were “no plans” for immediate talks.This latest confrontation follows months of personal barbs between Trump and Medvedev. After Trump called him the “failed former President of Russia,” Medvedev mocked Trump’s “jittery reaction,” and revived references to Russia’s Cold War-era “Dead Hand” nuclear system — a veiled reminder of Moscow’s atomic capabilities.Trump responded by ordering two US nuclear submarines to “appropriate regions,” calling Medvedev’s remarks “highly provocative” and warning of “unintended consequences.”",Russia reacts furiously to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new sanctions on its oil sector.

The new measures took nearly a month to finalise.

Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing might rise further as the US is planning its next move against China, after the 155% tariff threat.The Trump admin is reportedly preparing a response to China’s recent rare earth export restrictions by limiting shipments of US software-powered products to Beijing, a US official told Reuters. The proposed measures could span across a wide range of items, from laptops to jet engines.The curb aims to enforce US President Donald Trump’s October 10 social media warning, in which he announced plans to impose new tariffs of 100% on Chinese shipments to the US and introduce export controls on “any and all critical software” by November 1. Details of how the measures would be applied are not yet clear.Officials emphasised that the proposal may not be implemented, but its consideration signals a potential intensification of trade tensions with China.“Everything imaginable is made with US software,” one source said, highlighting the wide-reaching nature of the possible controls.The plan would target global shipments of products either containing US software or produced using US technology, echoing export restrictions imposed by the Biden administration on Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Analysts warn that if fully applied, the controls could disrupt trade with China and carry economic costs for the US.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy refrained from addressing the US measures, but stated that China opposes “unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures” and would take “resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests” if the US proceeds, Reuters reported.Trump’s announcement came just three weeks before a previously scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, and a day after China expanded its rare earth export controls, which are critical for technology manufacturing. The US president described the Chinese move as “a moral disgrace” and warned it would affect “virtually every product they make.”The administration is reportedly considering announcing the measures to apply pressure without putting them into effect immediately. Smaller and more limited proposals are also being discussed amid debates over how far to escalate.Trump’s stance on export restrictions has fluctuated during his presidency. While he initially imposed strict curbs on Nvidia’s AI chips and chip-design software exports to China, some measures were later lifted.Last month, China criticised a Trump administration rule limiting shipments from US firms to companies at least 50% owned by sanctioned Chinese entities.","The US is reportedly preparing a response to China’s recent rare earth export restrictions by limiting shipments of US software-powered products to Beijing.

Trump SHOCKS Putin With US Policy Shift; Kyiv Can Now Fire Storm Shadow Missiles Deep Inside Russia





The Donald Trump-led US administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, intensifying pressure on the Kremlin to end its war in Ukraine. The move marks one of Washington’s largest-ever sanctions packages against Moscow, announced after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused Vladimir Putin of not engaging “honestly” in talks with the US president.“President Putin has not come to the table in an honest and forthright manner, as we'd hoped,” Bessent told Fox Business, adding that Trump was “disappointed at where we are in these talks.”The new measures target Russia’s two biggest oil firms -- Rosneft and Lukoil -- following the collapse of ceasefire discussions between Washington and Moscow. The announcement came a day after a planned Trump-Putin summit in Budapest was called off amid US frustration over the lack of progress in peace negotiations.Also read: Donald Trump claims India will cut down Russian oil imports by year end “Given President Putin's refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia's two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin's war machine,” Bessent said in a statement. He added that the Treasury Department was ready “to take further action if necessary” to back Trump’s push to end the conflict.Speaking ahead of the official announcement, Bessent described the move as “one of the largest sanctions that we have done against the Russian Federation.”Trump had resisted imposing new penalties for months, hoping to convince Putin to pursue peace despite mounting tensions. However, his patience reportedly ran out in the six days following their phone call last Thursday.Bessent recalled that during the leaders’ August meeting in Alaska, “President Trump walked away when he realized that things were not moving forward.” He added, “There have been behind-the-scenes talks, but I believe that the president is disappointed at where we are in these talks.”The European Union also announced fresh sanctions against Moscow on Wednesday, including a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports by 2027, the blacklisting of oil tankers used by Russia, and new travel restrictions for Russian diplomats.Also read: US sanctions major Russian oil firms; move amid Putin's 'refusal to end senseless war' Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly threatened sanctions but held off, hoping to broker an end to the three-and-a-half-year conflict.

Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

US Federal Reserve cuts rate by 25 bps: Jerome Powell-led FOMC says economic outlook uncertainty elevated; December cut ‘not a foregone conclusion’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fomc-meet-october-2025-highlights-us-federal-reserve-rate-cut-jerome-powell-commentary-inflation-economy-outlook-us-president-donald-trump-tariffs/articleshow/124912543.cms,"Jerome Powell (AP file photo)

US Federal Reserve decision: What Jerome Powell said

Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September.

Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.

Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. GDP rose at a 1.6% pace in the first half of the year, down from 2.4% last year.

Data available prior to the shutdown show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected, primarily reflecting stronger consumer spending, business investment in equipment and intangibles has continued to expand, while activity in the housing sector remains weak.

The shutdown of the federal government will weigh on economic activity while it persists, but these effects should reverse after the shutdown ends.

In the labor market, the unemployment rate remained relatively low through August, job gains have slowed significantly since earlier in the year. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and labor force participation, though labor demand has clearly softened as well.

Available evidence suggests that both layoffs and hiring remain low and that both households perceptions of job availability and firms, perceptions of hiring difficulty continue to decline in this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen in recent months.

Tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods resulting in higher overall inflation. A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short lived, a one time shift in the price level.

But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.

In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside a challenging situation

We judged it appropriate at this meeting to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance.

A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, far from it.





US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on Wednesday cut the key benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to the 3.75-4.00 per cent range. But the central bank of the world's largest economy also struck a cautious note about the economic outlook and future rate cuts possibility. According to the FOMC statement, ""uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated.""“Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated,” it said.“In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee decided to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings on December 1. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the statement said.Whilst the Federal Reserve has indicated potential additional rate reductions in December, the current lack of economic data creates additional uncertainty regarding their forthcoming decisions.This is the second consecutive rate cut by the central bank, aiming to safeguard against increasing employment market uncertainties, amid evident disagreements within the committee.The Fed's statement indicated that committee members voted 10-2 to reduce the central bank's primary lending rate.Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented, advocating for a larger 0.50 percentage point reduction, whilst Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid ""preferred no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting,"" according to the Fed's statement.Experts had widely anticipated that the Federal Reserve's rate committee will largely support a 0.25 percentage point reduction.The Federal Reserve elevated interest rates to approximately 5.3% between 2023 and 2024 to address the most significant inflation surge experienced in 40 years. A reduction in rates could eventually lead to decreased costs for various forms of borrowing, including home mortgages, vehicle financing, credit card debt and commercial loans.The timing is particularly challenging for the Federal Reserve, as employment growth remains slow whilst inflation continues to exceed their 2% objective. The situation is further complicated by the absence of crucial government economic indicators typically used for decision-making, including monthly employment statistics, inflation data and consumer expenditure reports, which are currently suspended due to the government closure.The rate reduction will strengthen the US economy, which continues to adjust to President Donald Trump 's tariff policies, whilst providing officials additional time to assess the government shutdown's impact.The political impasse between Republicans and Democrats continues nearly a month into the shutdown, resulting in the temporary cessation of most official statistical releases.The Federal Reserve operates independently with two primary objectives: managing inflation and unemployment rates through adjustments to its primary lending rate, whether increasing, maintaining, or decreasing it.Reduced rates encourage economic and employment growth, typically resulting in lower mortgage costs. Conversely, increased rates restrict economic activity and control inflation.According to an AFP report, recent statements from Federal Reserve officials indicate growing worry about employment market deceleration, prompting them to prioritise job creation despite inflation exceeding their target rate.Additionally, there remains ongoing tension regarding Trump's efforts to influence Federal Reserve operations, alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's public initiative to identify Powell's successor when his chairmanship concludes in May.","US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on Wednesday cut the key benchmark rate by 25 basis points.

MCX Gold has started gaining upward momentum after forming a doji candlestick pattern near the crucial support zone around ₹1,17,500 levels, signaling a potential reversal from the recent corrective phase. The doji formation at the bottom indicates indecision among traders, often preceding a change in market direction. Following this pattern, prices have shown renewed strength, suggesting that bullish sentiment is gradually returning to the market.In the coming week, gold prices are expected to move higher towards the ₹1,25,000 mark, supported by improved buying interest and a positive technical setup. On the downside, immediate support is seen around ₹1,19,000, which is likely to act as a strong base for the ongoing recovery. As long as prices hold above this level, the bias is expected to remain positive.A sustained move above ₹1,22,500 could further accelerate the upside momentum, opening the door for higher targets in the short term. Broader factors such as global economic uncertainty, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, and central bank gold purchases are also expected to support the bullish trend. Overall, the outlook for MCX Gold remains optimistic, with traders advised to maintain a buy-on-dips approach while keeping an eye on key support levels.MCX Silver has started to gain strong upward momentum after consolidating in a narrow range over the past few sessions. Prices have now climbed to around ₹1,48,000 levels, reflecting renewed buying interest and improving market sentiment. The recent breakout above the consolidation zone suggests that bulls are gradually regaining control, supported by firm global cues and increasing investor appetite for precious metals.From a technical perspective, the overall bias remains positive as long as prices sustain above the key support level of ₹1,45,000. This zone is expected to act as a solid base for further upside movement. On the higher side, silver prices are likely to face minor resistance near ₹1,50,500, but once this level is decisively breached, the rally could extend towards ₹1,55,000 in the near term.The strengthening of gold prices and expectations of slower rate hikes globally are also lending support to silver. Additionally, industrial demand recovery and a weaker U.S. dollar index could further fuel bullish momentum. Traders are advised to maintain a buy-on-dips approach while keeping stop-losses below ₹1,45,000. Overall, the short-term outlook for MCX Silver remains optimistic, with the potential for prices to test higher resistance levels in the coming sessions.","Gold and silver prices may start exhibiting some strength in the coming days, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Pak Minister Khawaja Asif Accuses Afghanistan Acting Under India’s Influence, Issues Brutal Warning

Importance of Chabahar port for India





In a boost for India’s regional connectivity plans especially with regard to Afghanistan, the Donald Trump administration has granted extension of sanctions waiver on Iran’s Chabahar port According to an ET report, India has managed to get an extension for the sanctions waiver until early next year on the Chabahar Port. This port plays a vital role in India’s regional connectivity strategy by providing access to Afghanistan and Central Asia-Eastern Russia.Following the expiry of the US sanctions waiver on Tuesday, India successfully negotiated an extension until early next year, sources told ET. During extensive discussions, India emphasised the necessity of maintaining the Chabahar Port's operations as an essential component of its regional connectivity initiatives.Earlier reports had confirmed that New Delhi was working towards obtaining an extension of the sanctions waiver, with the matter under review. India had received a US sanctions waiver for the port until October 28, following an initial deadline of September 29 for the waiver's revocation.On May 13, 2024, India entered into a decade-long agreement to operate the Chabahar port. The contract was finalised between Indian Ports Global Limited and Iran's Port & Maritime Organisation.The Chabahar Port plays a vital role in strengthening India-Afghanistan economic relations and delivering humanitarian assistance, including ambulances that India provided during the Afghan foreign minister's recent visit.The Taliban administration shows strong interest in utilising the Chabahar Port for international connections.Plans are underway to link Chabahar Port with the International North-South Transport Corridor and Central Asian nations. Sources told the financial daily that India's Central Asian ally Uzbekistan, following a multipolar approach, seeks alternatives to China's Belt and Road Initiative for connectivity in Eurasia and anticipates India's involvement in addressing Chabahar Port matters.Notably, Uzbekistan holds the distinction of being one of only two doubly landlocked countries globally, alongside Liechtenstein.Reports suggest that Russia intends to access the Chabahar Port through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to facilitate trade with India and other Asian regions.","On May 13, 2024, India entered into a decade-long agreement to operate the Chabahar port.

8th Pay Commission: Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will raise the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and pensions of 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, The government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to assess and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will raise the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and pensions of 69 lakh retired personnel.

Is America running out of pennies? Trump’s cost-cutting plan leaves retailers counting losses; what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/america-runs-out-of-pennies-trumps-common-cents-plan-to-save-cashretailers-left-counting-losses/articleshow/124980444.cms,"'Trump Using Hunger For Bargain': Shockwaves In U.S. Over SNAP Cuts As Shutdown Explodes

'Wanted it to go—but not like this!'

High cost, less worth—Pennies go away

Common Cents Act

How is it impacting government and retailers





America is running out of pennies, quite literally!The US is facing a nationwide shortage of pennies, months after President Donald Trump halted production of the one-cent coin without introducing a transition plan.The decision, which came as a cost-saving measure, is now impacting the country’s commerce. In many shops and banks, staff are struggling to handle cash transactions without the smallest denomination coin.Retailers in several states have exhausted their penny supplies and can no longer provide exact change to customers paying with cash. Banks, meanwhile, say they are receiving no new stock and have begun rationing pennies to their clients.One regional chain, Sheetz, even tried to lure the coins back into circulation by offering customers a free soda in exchange for 100 pennies. Another business has warned that the shortage will cost millions this year because it is rounding transactions down to avoid legal challenges.“It’s a chunk of change,” Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation, told AP.The strain first became visible in late summer and is intensifying as retailers prepare for the busy holiday trading period.“We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,” said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.Banks said that they received little warning. Troy Richards, president of Guaranty Bank & Trust Co in Louisiana, told AP that penny deliveries abruptly stopped in August.“We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,” Richards said.The $1,800 worth of pennies his branches held disappeared within a fortnight. Only small, controlled amounts are now given to cheque-cashing customers.The sudden halt has also left companies pleading with consumers to pay with exact change.However, despite these struggles, not one retailer or bank is pushing to restore production of the coin, disliked due to its weight and limited use.“We don’t want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,” the NACS’ Lenard said.A few days into his second term, on February 9, President Trump announced that the US will stop minting pennies, calling the decision part of a broader effort to streamline government spending. Both the penny and nickel have been more expensive to produce as compared to their costs.The US Mint’s latest report shows why: it cost 3.7 cents to make a penny in 2024, and 13.8 cents to produce a nickel.“Let’s rip the waste out of our great nation’s budget, even if it’s a penny at a time,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.The treasury department placed its final order for blank copper-zinc planchets ( metal disks that are minted into coins) in May. The last penny was minted in June and, by August, the remaining stocks were dispatched to banks and cash-handling companies.A bill, Common Cents Act, currently in Congress, proposes standardising cash payments by rounding to the nearest nickel. Businesses are open to it, but consumer advocates warn that rounding up could increase costs for shoppers.The treasury department has not responded to requests for guidance on how retailers and banks should manage the growing disruption.Other countries took years to phase out low-value coins. Canada announced the end of its one-cent piece in 2012 and eased out of using it through 2013, while Britain’s shift to the decimal system stretched across much of the 1960s and early 1970s.By contrast, the US removed the penny from circulation within months, and without legislative backing, a move that has left banks and retailers demanding clarity.The Mint: Despite issuing 3.23 billion pennies in 2024, more than any other US coin, most do not return to circulation. Americans tend to hoard pennies in jars or keep them as decor, forcing the Mint to manufacture billions each year. By ending production, the treasury expects to save $56 million, while the Mint remains profitable overall, generating $182 million in seigniorage last year through other coins and collectors’ sets.Compounding the issue, almost a third of the Federal Reserve’s coin distribution terminals are now closed to both penny withdrawals and deposits. That means regions that still have spare pennies have no way to send them to regions running out.“As a result of the US department of the treasury’s decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted,” a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.Retailers: Retailers now face legal complications. In several states, rounding cash transactions up to the nearest nickel is illegal, as it would unfairly disadvantage cash customers compared with card users.To avoid lawsuits, stores are rounding down instead, a policy that comes with a financial hit. Kwik Trip, a convenience chain in the Midwest, says rounding down at tills could cost it around $3 million this year. Others are encouraging customers to donate loose change at counters to avoid handling pennies altogether.","President Donald Trump halted production of the one-cent coin without introducing a transition plan.

BENGALURU: TCS’s $6.5 billion capex blueprint for the AI data centre move goes beyond risk capital—it signals a push to build capabilities and perhaps prevent tech colonisation. Indian firms are increasingly turning to private capital to expand capacity and meet surging digital demand.In a recent interview with TOI, TCS CEO K Krithivasan said it aims to become the world's largest AI-led services company. “This initiative also has a strong India angle, alongside global opportunities with our existing clients. In terms of funding, it will be a mix of equity and debt. On the equity side, we’ve partnered with a financial investor, giving us the flexibility and control to shape our growth path and decide who we work with—resulting in a stronger and more strategic business model. ”Prateek Jhawar, MD and head of infrastructure and real assets investment banking at Avendus Capital, said institutions like Apollo, Blackstone, and CPP Investments are structuring long-tenor debt against contracted hyperscaler cash flows.“Recent deals (Digital Realty’s $7 billion JV with Blackstone, Aligned’s $1.7 billion private credit raise, and EdgeCore’s $1.9 billion financing) highlight how bespoke capital stacks are reshaping the ecosystem.The demand tailwinds are so strong that data centres are now being underwritten more like core infrastructure assets, not just technology real estate,” he said.Jhawar said the country’s data centre capacity is expected to exceed 2,000 MW in the next 2 years, requiring an estimated $3.5 billion of incremental investment. He said operators such as AdaniConneX, Yotta Data, and CapitaLand have raised cumulatively $2 billion to fund hyperscale campuses in Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad. “What’s changing is not just the volume of capital, but the nature of it. Flexible private credit structures and long-dated infrastructure funds are now competing to anchor Indian digital infrastructure. For investors, this convergence of AI-led demand, predictable cash flows, and hard-asset characteristics is transforming data centres into the defining infrastructure story of the next decade,” he added.A Barclays report showed that India can potentially receive around $19 billion in data centre investments by 2030, higher than the $12 billion it received last year. Sanjeev Dasgupta, CEO of CapitaLand Investment India, said India’s demand is driven by two key segments: hyperscalers and large enterprise customers such as banks, financial institutions, and stock exchanges. “Both are growing fast, but hyperscalers are expanding faster due to AI plans in India and other markets,” he said.",TCS's $6.5 billion capex blueprint for the AI data centre move signals a push to build capabilities and perhaps prevent tech colonisation.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remained range-bound last week, following a robust bullish rally in the preceding sessions. Global investors stayed on the sidelines, tracking developments on US–China and US–India trade negotiations. The US Federal Reserve, in its latest FOMC policy meeting, delivered a second consecutive rate cut, bringing the federal funds rate down to 3.75–4.00%, marking the lowest level in three years. However, Chair Jerome Powell’s neutral stance on the future monetary policy trajectory prompted profit-taking at higher levels on Thursday, leading to mild consolidation across key indices.Over the past six trading sessions, the Nifty has exhibited a sideways consolidation pattern, moving within a well-defined range of 25,700–26,100, broadly in line with expectations following the recent rally. This phase of time-wise correction suggests that the market is currently in a pause mode, digesting prior gains before the next directional move.From a technical perspective, sustained trade above the upper band of 26,100 could act as a trigger for bullish momentum, potentially propelling the index towards its previous all-time high of 26,277. A decisive breakout beyond this level may open the door for a further upside towards 26,500 in the near term, supported by improving market breadth and positive sectoral rotationThe broader market trajectory continues to exhibit a bullish bias, reaffirming that the primary uptrend remains firmly in place.The ongoing phase of consolidation is best interpreted as a healthy retracement and time correction following a sharp 1,500-point up move over the past four weeks.This constructive consolidation provides market participants with an opportune window to initiate fresh long positions and accumulate high-quality, fundamentally sound counters through a staggered accumulation strategy, thereby optimizing entry levels. In essence, the market appears to be undergoing a technical breather within an ongoing bullish structure, setting the stage for the next leg of the upward momentum once the consolidation base is firmly established.Strong support is seen around 25,700–25,500, which is likely to hold as it is the confluence of the recent breakout zone. The 20 days EMA is also placed around 25580 and the 38.2% retracement of the previous up move (24587-26104)Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily and weekly chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows in all time frames.Going ahead, a decisive move above last week’s high of 58,577 would confirm a breakout continuation, paving the way for a rally towards 59,000 and 59,300, which correspond to the 138.2% Fibonacci projection of the recent correction (57,628–53,561). However, failure to clear this level may result in range-bound movement between 58,600 and 57,300 in the near term.On the downside, immediate support is seen around 57,300–57,500, aligning with the previous breakout zone, while a stronger support base lies near 56,800–56,500.Overall, the outlook remains positive, and any pullbacks should be viewed as buying opportunities within these support areas.The stock has broken out above the falling trendline connecting the June 2025 and September 2025 highs, signaling strength and offering a fresh entry opportunity. The price action is forming a higher high–higher low structure on the daily timeframe, reinforcing the bullish outlook.We anticipate the stock to move higher towards the 129 level, which aligns with the June 2025 high and the 123.6% Fibonacci extension of the prior upswing from 98 to 117, projected from the recent low at 105.From a technical indicator perspective, the RSI remains in a bullish configuration and has recently triggered a buy signal, suggesting continued upward momentum.The stock is displaying a sustained bullish structure, forming consecutive higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart. It has also broken out of a prolonged base formation, accompanied by a decisive breach of its falling trendline resistance — signaling a transition from a consolidation phase to a fresh uptrend.A clear breakout from the descending triangle pattern has already occurred thus opening upwards towards 62 in the medium term being measured move projection derived from the descending triangle breakout.On the indicator front, the weekly RSI is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory, reflecting sustained strength in momentum. There are no visible signs of exhaustion or bearish divergence, suggesting that the prevailing bullish momentum remains intact without indications of a trend reversal.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 31, 2025 are NBCC, and Sagility.

BENGALURU: Tech firms and AI platforms are stepping up hiring, with AI-first roles now dominating new job openings. As companies accelerate their adoption of AI, demand for professionals skilled in data architecture, machine learning, and generative AI is soaring. India's strong technical talent, adaptability, and scale make it impossible for global firms to overlook in the evolving AI landscape.As AI-driven transformation gathers pace, companies are prioritising roles that can build and optimise data pipelines, develop AI models, and drive intelligent automation across business functions. OpenAI, which plans to open its first India office in New Delhi later this year, is hiring for roles such as AI deployment manager and solutions architect. Anthropic, the AI firm behind the coding assistant Claude, said it will open an office in Bengaluru early next year, its second in the Asia-Pacific region after Tokyo.The new centre is expected to further boost AI-related hiring in India. Accenture is also ramping up tech hiring, with over 16,000 open positions in India - including 89 roles in AI and data, 363 in cloud, and over 800 in consulting.Prashanth Chandrasekar, CEO of online developer community Stack Overflow, said modern-day product and engineering professionals are now expected to design, develop, and maintain AI-based systems.""They need strong skills in machine learning, programming, and data analytics to build applications that can learn and make decisions.""But as enterprises automate entry-level work, it's becoming harder for young to mid-career professionals to find opportunities to advance,"" he said.Srinivas Narayanan, CTO of B2B applications at OpenAI, said in the age of AI, software engineers must evolve into decision-makers with CEO-like vision. Speaking at IIT Madras Alumni Association's Sangam 2025 conference held in July in Bengaluru, he said, ""The job is shifting from just writing code to asking the right questions and defining the 'what' and 'why' of a problem. AI can already handle much of the 'how'."" India, experts say, is compelling both from a talent and business standpoint. ""India is compelling because of the scale of its technical talent and the government's commitment to ensure the benefits of artificial intelligence reach all areas of society,"" said Dario Amodei, cofounder and CEO of Anthropic, during his recent visit to India.Viral Shah, cofounder and CEO of software-as-a-service platform JuliaHub, said, ""You won't be replaced by AI, but by someone using AI."" He cited Dyad, the company's AI-native simulation platform that accelerates hardware design, noting that tasks which earlier took engineers days can now be completed in hours. However, the firm cautioned that correctness remains the biggest challenge, especially when AI-generated code is used.","India's strong technical talent, adaptability, and scale make it impossible for global firms to overlook in the evolving AI landscape.

Overhaul housing index compilation method: Statistics ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/overhaul-housing-index-compilation-method-statistics-ministry/articleshow/124967680.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The statistics ministry is proposing that the housing index compilation methodology be revised significantly as part of the base revision exercise of the consumer price index (CPI).As a part of CPI, housing constitutes a major component with an expenditure share of nearly 21.7% in urban areas and 10.1% at the all-India level in the current series. ""In the ongoing base revision exercise, all aspects of index compilation methodology are expected to be revisited to prepare a more robust and resilient CPI series,"" the ministry has said as it unveiled a discussion paper .Rent data will be collected monthly, replacing the current practice of collecting rent every six months. The new series will compile the Housing Index for both rural and urban sectors. This marks a departure from the current series, which includes only the urban sector, due to the absence of imputed rent data for rural areas in the household consumption expenditure survey 2011-12.Rent data will be collected from 12 dwellings per urban market, subject to the availability of rented units, and in selected villages, data will be collected from 6 dwellings, based on availability.The discussion paper says that to eliminate distortions introduced sometimes due to concessional or employer-provided dwellings as govt accommodations, such dwellings will be excluded from the compilation of the index as they do not reflect transactions in the actual rental market.Housing is a crucial indicator for the overall well-being of the households not only in India but across the world as a significant amount of their income is spent either on house rent or maintaining an owned house.The ministry of statistics and programme implementation has invited views and comments from experts, academicians, ministries, departments, states, financial institutions and other stakeholders on the proposed housing index compilation methodology.","As a part of CPI, housing constitutes a major component with an expenditure share of nearly 21.7% in urban areas.

PATNA: Government has indicated that it is close to finalising a bilateral trade deal with the US and also hinted that the much-delayed Export Promotion Mission is expected to be announced in the next fortnight or so. During a meeting with Export Promotion Councils in Delhi late on Wednesday, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told representatives of trade bodies that the required clearances for the Export Promotion Mission are nearly in place.The Mission, announced in the budget in Feb, seeks to address credit problems, help in promoting products overseas and assist companies in dealing with trade barriers. But, with the govt hoping to clinch a trade deal in next few weeks, a relief package has not been given immediately and is unlikely to be provided anytime soon, especially with positive signals coming from the US, with President Donald Trump himself indicating his intent to move ahead.Exporters had a long list of concerns over the impact of the US tariffs on Indian exports and sought govt assistance in addressing liquidity and loan repayment problems. Goyal has asked his officials to facilitate discussions with RBI, finance ministry and banks over the next few days to address the problem, especially in sectors, such as textiles, which have been hit hard by Trump's 50% tariffs.Some of the textiles exporters pointed to the 30 percentage point differential between Indian and other country exports to the US and said that buyers were demanding a steep discount, something that the commerce department has sought to discourage.As a result, they demanded loan repayment moratorium, liquidity support, such as the one that was given to MSMEs during Covid and revival of the interest equalisation scheme, considering the cost of capital in India was high. Some of the businesses also suggested that the Centre should provide fiscal support through scrips.At the meeting, some of the exporters also flagged concerns around the way the Quality Control Orders (QCOs) have been implemented, impacting their supplies and inputs. Some of them suggested that only the finished products should face QCOs. Goyal, however, defended the move, arguing that there are positives, which have not been adequately highlighted.","Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told representatives of trade bodies that the required clearances for the Export Promotion Mission are nearly in place.

This is an interim relief for all IAs and RAs as they can now share their past performance with their clients, mainly to attract new business.In April this year, Sebi had specified the framework for creation and operationalisation of PaRRVA, primarily to address the demand of the IAs and RAs to display their performance. Under Sebi's regulatory purview, PaRRVA will carry out the verification activities prospectively for the period, post onboarding of the IAs/RAs with the agency, Sebi said.In the last few months, Sebi had received representations from the industry associations of IAs/RAs to facilitate them to communicate past performance data to clients for the period prior to operationalisation of PaRRVA.""Such past performance data shall be communicated to clients (including prospective clients) on a one-to-one basis and shall not be made available to general public through public media/website of IA/RA or any other mode,"" the Sebi circular on Thursday said.It also said that IAs/RAs who wish to communicate past performance data to clients must enrol with PaRRVA within three months of its operationalisation, else they will not be allowed to do it.

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Thursday said that exchanges that have derivative products on non-benchmark indices will have to readjust the weights of their constituents in such a way that no one stock dominates the index. As of now there are derivative products on BankNifty, Bankex and FinNifty.In addition to the existing rules for constructing indices, stock exchanges shall follow some additional norms for non-benchmark indices on which derivative (futures & options) products are traded, a Sebi circular said. These norms would have to be followed for launching new derivative products on any other non-benchmark indices in future.Among others, these norms specify that the index should have a minimum of 14 constituents, the weight of the top constituent should not be more than 20%, and the combined weight of the top three constituents should not exceed 45%.Some of the non-benchmark indices include Bankex, Bank Nifty, FinNifty etc. In India, the main benchmark indices are Nifty and sensex.Market players said the regulatory intent here is to have indices with less scope for manipulation and also derivative products based on those.In the Jane Street case, a Sebi analysis had shown how the US-based trading giant had allegedly manipulated the stock prices of some of the index constituents to simultaneously trade in the derivatives products based on those indices in a way that brought in massive profits.""The composition of the index will be such that those are not going to be manipulated, with a cap on the weight of each component...this (index manipulation) was a major issue cited in Sebi's Jane Street order,"" said a market veteran.Sebi in its circular said that the exchanges could adjust the weights of at least two indices-Bankex (on BSE) and FinNifty (on NSE)-in a single tranche. However, for BankNifty, Sebi has given a glide path for making the necessary changes over a four-month period. The glide path has been provided ""to ensure orderly rebalancing of assets under management (AUM) tracking the index.Sebi said that the new constituents would be added in tranche 1.

In each adjustment, the weight of top 3 constituents would be checked and if the weights are beyond the prudential norms, the excess would be targeted for reduction equally over the remaining tranches.""The effective dates for implementation of eligibility criteria for derivatives on non-benchmark indices have been extended up to March 31, 2026 for BankNifty and up to December 31, 2025 for Bankex and FinNifty.","Market players say the regulatory intent here is to have indices with less scope for manipulation.

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and make landfall along the Andhra Pradesh coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam, near Kakinada, by Tuesday evening, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The name Montha meaning “beautiful” or “fragrant flower” was suggested by Thailand, one of the 13 member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UN ESCAP panel that governs cyclone naming in the North Indian Ocean region. Each name is used only once and never repeated.In the North Indian Ocean, which includes the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, cyclone naming is managed by the WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones. This panel includes 13 countries: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Yemen, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.Each member submits a list of names that reflect their culture, language, or natural environment. The names are then used sequentially whenever a new cyclone reaches the intensity required to be officially named by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which acts as the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for this region.Each country has submitted 13 names, forming a list of 169 names used sequentially and alphabetically. Names are neutral to gender, politics, and religion. The first cyclone of this season, Shakhti, suggested by Sri Lanka, formed earlier this month in the Arabian Sea but spared the Indian coast.The cyclone is likely to bring heavy rain across Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu with red alerts issued for several coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh.After Montha, the next cyclones will be named Senyar (UAE), Ditwah (Yemen), Arnab (Bangladesh), and Murasu (India). The naming system began in 2004, following a decision by the WMO and ESCAP in 2000, to make communication about tropical storms simpler and more effective for public awareness and disaster management.","Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by October 28.

The average long-term US mortgage rate has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, offering some relief to homebuyers and homeowners amid a prolonged housing slump.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.17% from 6.19% last week -- its fourth consecutive weekly decline, AP reported.

A year earlier, the rate was 5.99%, according to Freddie Mac.Lower mortgage rates improve homebuyers’ purchasing power and make refinancing more attractive. However, the broader US housing market has been sluggish since mortgage rates began rising above 6% in September 2022, following a long stretch of record lows.Sales of previously owned homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly three decades. While activity picked up last month — the fastest pace since February — the sector remains under pressure.Mortgage rates typically track the 10-year Treasury yield, which moves with investors’ expectations for inflation and the economy. The yield rose to 4.08% in midday trading Thursday, up from below 4% over the past two weeks.The Federal Reserve this week cut its benchmark interest rate again to support the slowing job market. But Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that another reduction in December is “not a foregone conclusion.”Analysts said the Fed may pause further rate cuts if inflation rises -- a risk heightened by the Trump administration’s expanding use of tariffs. Persistent inflation could prompt investors to demand higher returns, lifting Treasury yields and, in turn, mortgage rates.While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its policy moves influence broader borrowing costs. After its first rate cut in four years last fall, mortgage rates had unexpectedly climbed, topping 7% in January this year before easing again.","The average long-term US mortgage rate has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year.

ECB policy decision: Central bank keeps rates steady at 2% as inflation nears target; debate shifts to timing of next cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ecb-policy-decision-central-bank-keeps-rates-steady-at-2-as-inflation-nears-target-debate-shifts-to-timing-of-next-cut/articleshow/124956150.cms,"Debate grows over next move





The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday held interest rates unchanged at 2%, warning that the eurozone’s economic outlook remained “uncertain” amid global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions.After a year-long cycle of rate cuts, the ECB has maintained its key deposit rate at two percent since July, with inflation now stabilising around the central bank’s medium-term target, AFP reported.“Inflation remains close to the two-percent medium-term target and the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook is broadly unchanged,” the ECB said in a statement.Officials had signalled little ahead of the meeting to suggest a shift in policy. Jose Luis Escriva, Spain’s central bank chief and a member of the ECB’s governing council, said in an interview with El Diario that the “current level of interest rates is appropriate”.The meeting took place in Florence as part of the ECB’s regular rotation away from its Frankfurt headquarters, with investors now awaiting President Christine Lagarde’s press conference for cues on the rate trajectory.In contrast, the US Federal Reserve has resumed rate cuts, trimming borrowing costs for a second consecutive meeting on Wednesday by a quarter point, reflecting concern over a softening labour market.While the eurozone economy has fared better than expected — prompting the ECB to raise its growth forecast at its September meeting — policymakers remain divided on whether more rate cuts may be needed in coming months.The central bank faces headwinds including political uncertainty in France, which has driven up borrowing costs, along with trade risks and signs of slowing wage growth.Rate-setters appear “split with regard to the balance of risks to inflation and, therefore, on the need for an ‘insurance’ cut over the coming few months,” UniCredit analysts said this week.Lithuanian governing council member Gediminas Simkus had earlier argued for a cut at the ECB’s next meeting in December. “From a risk-management perspective, it’s better to cut than not,” he told Bloomberg, warning that a strong euro and slowing wages could drag inflation lower.Andrew Kenningham, economist at Capital Economics, told AFP he expected the ECB to resume cuts in 2026 as both inflation and wage growth weaken. “There are now very few reasons to fear a resurgence of inflation — the economy remains so weak, the labour market is loosening,” he said.",The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday held interest rates unchanged at 2%.

‘Very Good…’: Trump Drops Major Russian Oil Reveal After Talks With Xi, Lauds India





In a partial de-escalation of trade hostilities, the United States and China announced several tentative agreements on Thursday, including resumption by Beijing of global supply of rare earth elements and its purchase of US agricultural produce. The purported detente followed the first face-to-face meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in six years, held on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.On his way back to the US on Air Force One, President Trump, with his trademark hyperbole, rated the meeting a ""12"" out of 10, stating that an ""outstanding group of decisions"" were made, including a one-year unfreezing on China’s rare earth export controls which constrained supplies to the whole world, and which he expected to be renewed annually. Indicating the hard bargaining that took place, China, in turn, said the U.S. will pause its investigations targeting its maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding industries for one year, giving temporary relief to the exporting juggernaut.President Xi, clearly less effusive and more guarded than a euphoric Trump, confirmed separately through the state media a ""consensus on resolving"" important economic and trade issues while urging officials to follow up and refine the agreements to produce ""tangible results,” suggesting residual wrinkles will need to be ironed out in follow-up talks.Illustrative also of New Delhi’s sidelining in the tariff detente because of its lack of leverage, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that the matter of China buying Russian oil did not come up in talks with Xi even though they discussed ways to end the Russia-Ukraine war.“You know he's (Xi) been buying oil from Russia for a long time. It takes care of a big part of China and you know I can say India's been very good on that front, but, uh, we didn't really discuss the oil… we discussed working together to see if we could get that war finished..."" Trump said.The US has berated India for buying Russian oil and coerced it to taper purchase, but Trump’s remarks seemed to admit the US has no capacity to do the same to China.In fact, beneath his bravado and repeated assertions of a “great relationship” and ""tremendous success,"" critics noted that Trump faced a stone-faced Xi, who called for a focus on the ""long-term benefits of cooperation"" rather than falling into a ""vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.” Delivering a straight up lecture to Trump, the Chinese leader said it is normal for the world's two biggest economies to have differences, but they should aim to be ""partners and friends"" and maintain the ""overall stability"" of China-US relations.On his way home, Trump reeled off a long list of what he achieved at the talks – received skeptically by critics back home – including China ""resuming purchase of massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products."" He claimed China has also “agreed to continue the flow of Rare Earth, Critical Minerals, Magnets, etc., openly and freely,” while Beijing indicated it was conditionally lifting the moratorium for a year.The US President also said “China has strongly stated that they will work diligently with us to stop the flow of Fentanyl into our Country” while lifting the additional 10 per cent fentanyl-related tariffs on Beijing, even as he appeared to ease restrictions on export of advanced semi-conductor chips, leaving it for Nvidia (the top tier US company which wants to export the chips with the argument that curtailing chips to China will simply result in it developing its own) to sort it out with Beijing.Trump lashed out at critics who suggested Xi had the better of him at the talks. “Worked really hard, 24/7, took in Trillions of Dollars, and Chuck Schumer said trip was “a total dud,” even though he knows it was a spectacular success. Words like that are almost treasonous!!!” he raged on X.","President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.

Explained: Why America keeps winning the billionaire game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-why-america-keeps-winning-the-billionaire-game/articleshow/124941205.cms,"The world’s top five richest individuals, Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Larry Page, are all American/ Image: AP

World Ultra Wealth Report 2025

$101 Billion in 1 Day: How Larry Ellison Became the World’s Richest Man Explained

The resilience of American capital





The rest of the world can’t keep up





A system that rewards the bold and risk takers

The bigger picture









The world has an odd relationship with American wealth. It resents it, borrows from it, copies it, and yet, inevitably, revolves around it. Each time the global economy shifts, whether through inflation, trade wars, or a technology crash, the United States somehow emerges with more billionaires, more ultra-rich individuals, and a stronger gravitational pull on global capital. The latest data from Altrata’slays this bare in numbers almost too large to grasp: America now houses 38 percent of the world’s ultra-high-net-worth population, more than the combined share of the next ten nations.This is not a one-off statistical anomaly but a structural dominance. The United States has accumulated an extraordinary $22.3 trillion in private wealth held by just 192,470 individuals worth over $30 million each, a class of people whose fortunes collectively outstrip the GDP of entire continents. Despite political volatility, fluctuating markets, and a trade policy defined by tariffs and confrontation, the number of ultra-rich Americans surged by 21 percent last year alone. China, its nearest rival, holds just $5.9 trillion across 54,020 individuals.In addition to the US and China, the top 10 countries in terms of ultra-wealthy population include Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, France, Italy, and India, with the US far surpassing them in both total wealth and billionaire concentration.There is a peculiar kind of resilience baked into the American economy. Even when Washington imposes tariffs or restricts global trade, policies that, in theory, should stifle growth, the US finds new ways to profit from the disruption. Part of this stems from its diversified corporate ecosystem: Silicon Valley’s tech giants, Wall Street’s financial behemoths, and a robust private equity network that thrives on volatility rather than stability.Altrata’s research suggests that deregulation, tax incentives for the wealthy, and an extraordinarily dynamic stock market have allowed America’s richest to continue compounding their gains. Trump-era policies, criticised abroad as isolationist, often ended up fuelling domestic wealth creation. Reduced corporate taxes widened margins for American conglomerates and, in turn, expanded the net worth of their founders and shareholders.Technology, in particular, has been the great multiplier. Of the world’s five richest people, Elon Musk , Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg Jeff Bezos , and Larry Page , all are American, all are products of the digital age, and all have created economic ecosystems around their companies. Musk’s $500 billion net worth alone symbolises this new era of tech-driven dominance, where innovation, capital, and state influence intersect seamlessly.The imbalance is stark. Even as Asia, Europe, and the Middle East diversify their economies, they have not come close to replicating the United States’ billionaire machine. China, once seen as the inevitable challenger, has stalled. With trade conflicts tightening and export restrictions weighing down its tech sector, China’s ultra-wealthy population has expanded only marginally. Altrata records a clear deceleration, a signal that state control and market dynamism still make uneasy companions.Europe, meanwhile, has crossed the 1,000-billionaire threshold for the first time, a symbolic milestone that pales in comparison to America’s 1,135. The continent’s wealth growth, though steady, lacks the risk appetite that defines US capitalism. The same volatility that unnerves regulators elsewhere is what keeps American enterprise alive.Altrata’s Billionaire Census 2025 offers another lens: North America’s billionaire population, dominated overwhelmingly by the United States — rose by 7.8 percent last year to 1,198 individuals, lifting its global share to 34 percent. Of these, 1,135 are American, reflecting how deeply the region’s wealth is concentrated in the US The combined worth now exceeds $13 trillion, greater than the market capitalisation of Apple , Microsoft, and NVIDIA combined.If there is a secret to America’s endurance, it lies in the way its system rewards audacity. American wealth creation has always been speculative, future-focused, and deeply individualistic. Venture capital flows freely, failure is survivable, and regulation tends to follow innovation rather than precede it. In that environment, capital compounds exponentially.By contrast, Europe’s wealth is old and institutional; Asia’s, new but constrained. American wealth remains entrepreneurial — and that makes all the difference. Even as global asset markets fluctuate and inflation tests every portfolio, the US continues to produce billionaires at a pace no one else can match. In 2024 alone, Altrata found that 10 percent of those worth between $1 billion and $2 billion globally dropped below that threshold. Yet in America, new entrants filled the gap almost immediately.That churn, that continuous regeneration of fortunes, is what defines the US advantage. It is not merely about size but renewal. The billionaire class in America does not remain static; it evolves alongside the technologies it funds and the markets it disrupts.There is an irony in all this. The United States, often criticised for inequality, remains the most effective wealth incubator in human history. Its share of the global ultra-wealthy may rise or fall slightly year to year, but the structure of its economy, open, competitive, and aggressively capitalist, ensures it never loses its lead for long.Tariffs, trade wars, or populist rhetoric may change the mood, but they have not changed the maths. As long as American innovation outpaces the rest of the world, and its financial system remains the global engine of liquidity, it will continue to dominate the billionaire game.It is fashionable to predict the end of the American century. But in the numbers, $22 trillion in private ultra-wealth, 38 percent of the world’s richest, and a billionaire population still rising faster than anyone else’s, the century looks far from over.","The world has an odd relationship with American wealth.

A road that still runs one way





Donald Trump’s flair for bold declarations collided with Toyota’s characteristic restraint this week. During his visit to Japan, the US president announced that Toyota Motor was readying an investment “to the tune of over $10 billion” in the United States — a statement swiftly contradicted by the automaker itself. The episode has reignited discussion not only about political theatrics but also about the enduring imbalance between US and Japanese car markets, where American vehicles struggle to gain traction while Japanese brands dominate globally.Toyota moved quickly to clarify that no such promise had been made. “During the first Trump administration, I think the figure was roughly around $10 billion, so while we didn’t say the same scale, we did explain that we’ll keep investing and providing employment as before. So, probably because of that context, the figure of about $10 billion came up,” said Masahiko Ueda, a senior Toyota executive, speaking on the sidelines of the Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo. “Therefore, we didn’t specifically say that we’ll invest $10 billion over the next few years.”Ueda also added that the topic of investment “did not come up when Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda briefly spoke to Trump at a US Embassy event on Tuesday evening,” according to Reuters.Toyota confirmed that while it remains committed to investing and creating jobs in the United States, there was no explicit commitment of the magnitude Trump had claimed.Trump’s remarks came during a high-profile trip to Japan, where he met the country’s new and first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. He hailed her pledge to accelerate Japan’s military build-up and the signing of new trade and rare-earth mineral agreements between the two nations. Takaichi, for her part, promised to usher in a “golden age” of US-Japan relations and “fundamentally reinforce” Japan’s defence posture.At a US naval base in Yokosuka, Trump addressed American troops aboard the USS, urging them to “go out and buy a Toyota.” He told service members: “They’re going to be putting auto plants all over the United States to the tune of $10 billion. So that’s Toyota, so go out and buy a Toyota.”In a symbolic gesture that blended diplomacy with automotive theatre, Trump was greeted in Tokyo by an enormous American-made Ford F-150 truck, a nod to a proposal within Japan’s government to buy a fleet of the vehicles. “She has good taste,” Trump quipped of Prime Minister Takaichi. “That’s a hot truck.”Beyond the theatrics lies the long-standing asymmetry between Japan’s thriving exports to America and the near-invisibility of US cars on Japanese roads. In 2024, Japan exported over 1.37 million vehicles to the United States, according to thecars remain the nation’s top export to America. Yet Japan imported fewer than 17,000 American vehicles that same year, per theThe gap is glaring but not new. Japan’s urban density, narrow streets, and compact parking spaces make smaller, fuel-efficient models far more practical. Large, heavy-duty American trucks and SUVs, by contrast, are an awkward fit. Even among affluent consumers who can afford imports, most opt for European makes like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen , or Audi.Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba put it bluntly in parliament earlier this year:Recent data from the(JADA), published 4 April 2025, shows just how skewed the domestic market is. Japanese manufacturers accounted for 93 per cent of all car sales in March 2025. More than half — 52.1 per cent — wereorpassenger cars, segments that US automakers do not produce for Japan. Toyota, Honda and Suzuki together hold 62.1 per cent of the market. About 40 per cent of all new cars sold are the ultra-compactcars, such as those by Suzuki and Daihatsu, vehicles tailored for Japan’s space-constrained environment.said Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of industry, labour & economics at the Center for Automotive Research.European automakers have succeeded precisely because they adapted. They invested in right-hand-drive models and local service networks. American firms lagged behind. Most US cars remain left-hand drive, a daily inconvenience in a country that drives on the left. The exception is Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep, whose rugged image resonates with Japanese buyers seeking a taste of Americana. The Jeep Wrangler, a symbol of outdoor adventure, dominates that niche. In 2024, European automakers sold over 100,000 vehicles in Japan: Mercedes-Benz (53,195 units), BMW (35,240), Volkswagen (22,779), and Audi (21,415). Jeep sold 9,633, while General Motors and Ford together barely passed a thousand. Ford, in fact, withdrew from Japan in 2017.Meanwhile, Japanese makers flourish across the Pacific. Toyota alone sold over 2.3 million vehicles in the United States in 2024, making it the nation’s second-largest carmaker. The imbalance is stark: Japan fills US roads, while US cars scarcely register in Japan.Cultural and infrastructural realities keep the divide intact. Japanese consumers prize efficiency, compactness, and reliability, attributes embodied by their homegrown brands. US cars, often larger and less fuel-conscious, remain misaligned with local expectations. Even enthusiasts who appreciate American classics worry about maintenance, spare parts, and servicing.Some US manufacturers are trying to adjust. General Motors now offers a right-hand-drive version of its eighth-generation Chevrolet Corvette, signalling belated recognition of Japan’s needs. But the impact is marginal. Jeep’s 0.2 per cent market share is still the highest for any US marque, and no American model cracks Japan’s top-50 best-sellers.The numbers tell their own story. About 95 per cent of cars on Japanese roads are Japanese-made. Imports occupy the remaining sliver, mostly European. The US footprint is microscopic, limited to niche collectors of vintage Cadillacs or Chevrolets.Trump’s exaggerated claim, then, isn’t merely a political misstep, it’s emblematic of a broader truth. The automotive relationship between America and Japan has never been one of equals. One builds cars the world buys; the other struggles to sell its own beyond its borders. Toyota’s polite correction to Trump’s boast underscores that reality: for all the talk of new investment, the road between Detroit and Tokyo still runs mostly one way.","U.S. President Donald Trump’s flair for bold declarations collided with Toyota's characteristic restraint this week.

China said on Thursday it will suspend for one year certain export restrictions, including those related to rare earth materials, that were announced earlier in October, signalling a temporary easing in trade tensions with the United States, AFP reported.According to Beijing’s commerce ministry, the decision to “suspend the implementation of the relevant export control measures... for one year, and study and refine specific plans” followed trade discussions in Malaysia this week and came on the same day as talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in South Korea.China, the world’s leading producer of rare earth minerals used in magnets critical for electric vehicles, electronics and defence industries, had on October 9 announced new controls on exports of rare-earth technologies--a sensitive sector that has long been a flashpoint in the economic rivalry between Beijing and Washington.The new rules required exporters to seek approval for technologies linked to mining, smelting and processing of rare earths, as well as for “assembly, adjusting, maintenance, repair and upgrading of production lines,” the commerce ministry said.Rare earths have remained a major sticking point in trade talks between the two sides, with Washington accusing Beijing of deliberately slowing down export licence approvals.As part of the reciprocal measures, the United States agreed to suspend for one year its “Entity List” export restrictions on affiliates of blacklisted foreign companies where they hold at least a 50% stake, according to the ministry.The US also agreed to reduce tariffs on certain Chinese goods, including lowering a fentanyl-related tax to 10%, while Beijing said it would adjust its countermeasures accordingly.In another move, Washington will suspend for one year its Section 301 investigation into China’s shipbuilding industry, which had led both countries to impose port fees on each other’s vessels. China, in turn, will freeze its “countermeasures” on American ships for the same duration, AFP reported.The Chinese commerce ministry added that both leaders had “reached consensus on cooperation in fentanyl trafficking control (and) expanding agricultural trade,” though no further details were provided.Following the meeting, Trump told reporters that China would immediately begin purchasing “tremendous amounts” of US soybeans and other farm products.Beijing also said the two sides would move to resolve issues surrounding the Chinese social media app TikTok, whose US operations Washington has sought to separate from its parent company ByteDance over national security concerns, AFP added.","China says it will suspend for one year certain export restrictions, including those related to rare earth materials.

Turning point for ties?





US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held high-stakes talks in South Korea on Thursday, seeking to ease months of escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The discussions, described by both sides as constructive, touched on tariffs, agricultural trade, and cooperation on curbing fentanyl exports — issues that have strained ties since early this year.Trump announced that overall tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced to 47 per cent from 57 per cent, and fentanyl-related tariffs cut to 10 per cent. On being asked, "" how soon do you think you could sign a trade deal with China?"" Trump replied, ""Well, I think pretty soon. We have not too many major stumbling blocks. We have a deal now. Every year we'll renegotiate the deal, but I think the deal will go on for a long time, long beyond the year. We'll negotiate at the end of a year.""Speaking specifically on the fentanyl issue, Trump told reporters after the meet, “We’re cutting fentanyl tariffs down to ten per cent after very good talks."" “I expect to be lowering that because I believe that they're going to help us with the fentanyl situation,” Trump further said.He also said the broader trade dispute between the two countries had been “settled,” describing the discussions with Xi as “very positive” and adding that “there’s a lot of understanding.”President Donald Trump said on Thursday that his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping resulted in a one-year agreement on the supply of key rare earth materials, which can be extended annually.“All the rare earths have been settled — and that’s for the world,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that the deal would be reviewed and renegotiated each year.US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that China has agreed to start talks on purchasing American energy. “In fact, a large-scale transaction could take place involving the purchase of oil and gas from the great state of Alaska. Chris Wright, Doug Burgum, and our respective energy teams will meet to explore the possibility of such a deal,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Trump said China would immediately resume purchases of American soybeans, signalling a return to agricultural cooperation that had been disrupted by tariff battles. ""Large amounts, tremendous amounts of the soybeans and other farm products are going to be purchased immediately, starting immediately. If you notice, President Xi authorized yesterday for China to start. Did you know that? Right. In very large quantities of soybeans and other things, which I appreciated. That was a very nice gesture,"" said the US President.The developments follow months of heightened trade frictions and could mark a turning point in efforts to stabilise US–China economic relations. Trump rated his meeting with Xi “on a scale of 1–10 being 12,” hinting at possible optimism about renewed ties. He also announced that he would visit China in April next year, continuing what appears to be a diplomatic reset, and could build on the momentum from the Busan talks.","US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held crucial talks, leading to tariff reductions on Chinese goods and fentanyl.

Trump’s Nuclear Nightmare Amid Putin ‘Breakup’: Govt Shutdown ‘Paralyses’ US Nuke Production





The ongoing US government shutdown has created a significant data vacuum, impacting the release of vital federal economic statistics, from employment figures to national GDP measurements.The information gap is set to widen as authorities postpone releasing third-quarter GDP figures for the largest economy globally.The US administration has postponed various reports on employment, trade and retail sales, with limited staff recalled only to produce essential inflation data necessary for Social Security payment calculations.The political standoff between Congressional Republicans and Democrats continues, with neither side conceding responsibility for the shutdown, whilst food assistance for numerous Americans hangs in the balance.Experts indicate that this increasing data absence could negatively influence business decisions regarding employment and investments. ""There's a huge demand right now for government data,"" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. ""Every industry is trying to figure out if the Federal Reserve is going to keep cutting interest rates,"" he added.""This is the time of year where most organizations are finalizing their budgets for 2026,"" Long further told AFP. ""So, almost any company is sitting there thinking: Do we think 2026 is going to be an uptick? Or a slowdown, or a recession?""The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organisation, estimates economic losses of up to $14 billion due to the shutdown.Oxford Economics' economist Matthew Martin suggests businesses will adopt a cautious approach, considering the uncertainty already created by President Trump's tariff policies. ""Businesses would therefore reduce their overall hiring to be on the safe side of things, until they see data that really points towards increased demand, or at least stabilization in the economy,"" he told AFP. Financial market participants require this data to make informed investment decisions across various asset classes.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs' recent analysis suggests that if the shutdown extends through mid-November, as predicted, most delayed data releases will likely be postponed until December. The report warns of potential distortions affecting both October and November data.Long emphasises the risk of permanent October data loss due to collection delays during the shutdown. Whilst retrospective data collection remains possible, extended delays could compromise accuracy and reliability. The situation risks producing either no data or ""tainted data"" as recall accuracy diminishes over time.Despite access to private sector information, analysts emphasise that government statistics remain irreplaceable as the most reliable economic indicators. ""We have a remarkable amount of uncertainty about just literally what's happening with labor supply, like how many people are in the United States and want jobs,"" said Brookings Institution senior fellow Wendy Edelberg. She noted significant uncertainty regarding emigration figures since early 2025.Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House acknowledges recent strong GDP growth whilst noting underlying economic pressures and uneven distribution of economic benefits. She emphasises the shutdown's negative economic impact: ""If you're not sure when your next paycheck is coming as a government worker, you're not going to be going out to eat for dinner."" ""You're maybe pushing off a trip, or just not buying little discretionary things.

OpenAI's IPO plans: AI giant might see up to $1 trillion valuation—When to expect it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/openais-ipo-plans-ai-giant-might-see-up-to-1-trillion-valuationwhen-to-expect-it/articleshow/124931997.cms,"



ChatGPT parent OpenAI might hit Wall Street soon in what could become one of the largest IPOs ever. According to sources, the initial public offering would place the company at a valuation of up to $1 trillion.The artificial intelligence giant has been exploring a potential regulatory filing as early as the second half of 2026, Reuters reported citing sources.In initial conversations, OpenAI has examined raising around $60 billion at the lower end, with expectations that the final figure could be higher. However, those familiar with the matter highlighted that discussions are preliminary and that the valuation, timing and size of the fundraising could shift depending on business performance and market conditions.Chief financial officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates that the company is targeting a listing in 2027, although the advisers involved believe that the process could move faster, potentially landing in late 2026.“An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,” an OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters. “We are building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.”The preparations come after a major internal restructuring aimed at reducing its dependence on Microsoft.An IPO would enable OpenAI to raise capital more efficiently and use publicly traded shares to pursue larger acquisitions, helping fund CEO Sam Altman ’s intention to channel trillions of dollars into AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.The company, now valued at about $500 billion, is expected to reach an annualised revenue run rate of approximately $20 billion by the end of the year, Reuters reported citing sources.However, despite booming sales, losses are also rising, the agency added.During a livestream on Tuesday, Altman acknowledged that going public was increasingly likely. “I think it's fair to say it is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we'll have,” he said.Founded as a nonprofit in 2015, OpenAI later created a capped-profit structure to ensure the nonprofit retained oversight and prioritised safe development of AI technology. This week, the business underwent another overhaul. A nonprofit, now known as the OpenAI Foundation, continues to hold control but now owns a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and holds a warrant for additional shares if certain performance milestones are met. The update gives the nonprofit entity financial stake in the company’s future success.A listing would deliver substantial returns to early backers, including SoftBank, Thrive Capital and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion, now owns about 27% of the company, Reuters reported.The discussions come at a time when AI is dominating investor appetite in global markets. Earlier this year, AI cloud operator CoreWeave went public at a valuation of $23 billion and has since roughly tripled. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a market value of $5 trillion, underlining its position at the centre of the worldwide AI investment boom.","ChatGPT parent OpenAI might hit Wall Street soon in what could become one of the largest IPOs ever.

FULL: Trump ‘Buries The Hatchet’ With Xi; Hints At ‘Great Meeting’ At Seoul Summit Amid Tariff War





US President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of a trade deal between US and China as he meets Xi Jinping in South Korea for a high-stakes talks, amid looming tariffs and trade tensions.When asked by a reporter, ""Mr President, do you plan to sign a trade deal today?"" Trump replied saying, ""could-be"". Further making a remark on their ties he added, ""We all have a great understanding.”""""I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time, and it is an honor to have you with us,"" further added Trump, while calling Xi a ""very tough negotiator"", before they went ahead to hold the anticipated talks.Meanwhile, when the two leaders sat down for talks, Xi Jinping seemed to strike a conciliatory tone, reading from prepared remarks that pointed to Beijing’s apparent desire to manage tensions constructively.“Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,” Xi said through a translator. “It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.”Also read: Donald Trump-Xi Jinping meet in South Korea - top quotes The Trump–Xi meeting in Busan comes amid a fragile and complex phase in US–China relations, marked by deep trade frictions, strategic mistrust, and competing economic interests. The two sides have spent months trading tariffs and accusations even as they quietly explore the possibility of a new framework for cooperation.Trade remains the most immediate fault line. Earlier this month, Beijing imposed sweeping export controls on rare earths — a critical sector it dominates and one that underpins global defence, automotive and electronics manufacturing. Washington responded with threats of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods, reviving fears of another tit-for-tat trade spiral. Trump has since softened his position, acknowledging that such duties are “not sustainable” and signalling openness to a compromise.Another key sticking point is fentanyl. Since March, a 20 per cent tariff has stayed in place over what Washington describes as Beijing’s failure to curb the trafficking of the deadly opioid into the United States. But Trump has indicated the tariff could be lowered, citing signs of greater cooperation. Reports suggest Washington may halve fentanyl-related tariffs in exchange for stricter Chinese controls on precursor chemical exports.Beyond tariffs, the Busan meeting carries geopolitical undertones. The United States continues to push China to reduce energy imports from Russia and to maintain restraint over Taiwan, while Beijing seeks a US acknowledgment of its “One China” principle. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently reaffirmed that Washington is “not walking away from Taiwan” even as trade negotiations continue, underlining how hard it will be to separate economics from security.Technology remains another flashpoint. Beijing wants Washington to ease export restrictions on advanced semiconductor chips vital for AI and high-performance computing. American chipmakers have warned that overzealous curbs could erode US competitiveness. Meanwhile, Trump’s order to transfer TikTok’s US operations to a domestic consortium — with a deal reportedly set to be finalised during the Busan talks — adds another layer of symbolism to the economic standoff.Despite these strains, both capitals have reason to de-escalate. Trump faces pressure from US farmers and manufacturers hit by disrupted supply chains, while China wants stability as it battles slowing growth and a property slump. A breakthrough in Busan could reopen tech trade, restore predictability for global markets, and provide political wins for both sides.As Trump put it, the moment could be “something very exciting for everybody” — but the stakes are high. The question now is whether optimism in Busan will translate into an actual deal that resets the tone of one of the world’s most consequential economic relationships.",US President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of a trade deal between US and China as he meets Xi Jinping in South Korea for a high-stakes talks.

The US Senate has given a major blow to US President Donald Trump’s order to impose additional 10% tariffs on Canada, revoking his authority to impose steep duties on the country.The resolution was passed late Wednesday (local time) with a 50–46 vote, as reported by The Hill. Four Republicans, Susan Collins and Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted with Democrats to support the measure.The push to restrict Trump’s tariff powers originally cleared the Senate on April 2 but was blocked when the Republican-led House declined to act on it.Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, revived the proposal this week, insisting that Trump’s justification for hitting Canada with tariffs does not fall under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.""I primarily object to the Canada tariffs because I don't think there's an emergency that should trigger the use of this statute,"" Kaine said during floor debate. ""The fracturing of this long-standing, powerful relationship [with Canada] is one of the many reasons I oppose them.""Senator Susan Collins has consistently argued that Maine, a state whose economy is tightly linked with Canada, would bear the brunt of the trade measures.""The Maine economy is integrated with Canada, our most important trading partner,"" she said previously, adding that tariffs on petroleum products, paper mills, forest industries and fisheries would harm many families and local economies.Tensions escalated after an advert broadcast during the World Series in Ontario used a clip of former US President Ronald Reagan criticising tariffs. Trump denounced the advert as a ""serious misrepresentation of the facts"" and called it a ""hostile act"", before announcing the additional 10% duties.Wednesday’s voting came immediately after another move by lawmakers to curb Trump’s trade authority, only a day earlier, five Republican senators sided with Democrats on a similar resolution aimed at ending his emergency tariff powers against Brazil.","The US Senate has given a major blow to US President Donald Trump’s order to impose additional 10% tariffs on Canada.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

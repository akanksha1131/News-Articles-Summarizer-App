Give 30% flat deductions to encourage savings

Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should look to increase the income tax threshold for the 30% tax bracket in her Union Budget 2025, says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.According to BankBazaar, three important income tax changes that need to be brought in Budget 2025 are; raising the 30% income tax threshold to Rs 18 lakh, restructuring tax brackets, and implementing a standardised 30% deduction on gross income.""The 30% tax slab has remained at ₹15 lakh since 2020, despite a 21% rise in the Cost Inflation Index,"" Shetty notes. ""We propose increasing this threshold to ₹18 lakh to reflect inflation and offer relief to urban salaried individuals burdened by rising costs."" This modification would help distribute the tax responsibility more equitably amongst higher-income earners.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Make NPS more attractive - here's how Shetty expresses concerns about solely increasing the tax-free income limit. ""Calls to raise tax-free income to ₹10 lakh are well-intentioned but shift the tax burden to higher earners. Bracket enhancements should be secular, ensuring fairness across all income levels,"" he explains. ""As per the AY2023-24 figures, just 2% of taxpayers contributed 77% of income tax. A balanced approach is necessary.""Regarding diminishing long-term savings and insurance adoption, Shetty observes, ""The absence of deductions in the new tax regime has led to reduced interest in essential financial protections. Life insurance penetration is dropping, and ELSS inflows are falling despite strong equity performance.""Also Read | Budget 2025: Reduce income tax rates, exceptionally high compared to other countries, says Assocham He adds, ""Fewer salaried individuals are engaging with small savings schemes, and interest in NPS remains low. These trends are concerning, especially amidst an economic slowdown, declining household savings, and stagnant incomes. The incentive to save and to insure—tax deductions—must continue.""Shetty advocates for a 30% flat deduction on gross income with a ₹15 lakh ceiling on deductions. ""A simplified deduction structure would incentivise savings, insurance, and long-term financial planning, vital for household stability.""","Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar, advocates for a 30% flat deduction on gross income.

Sebi plans SIPs as low as 250 to widen mutual funds reach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-plans-sips-as-low-as-250-to-widen-mutual-funds-reach/articleshow/117466843.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday proposed to launch monthly systematic investment plans (SIPs) for ticket size as low as Rs 250, aiming for wider financial inclusion . Calling this sachetisation of mutual funds , Sebi would partially subsidise the costs incurred by all the intermediaries for these small-ticket SIPs , it said in a consultation paper. To limit the amount of subsidy for these SIPs, the number of SIPs per PAN card will be limited to three, Sebi said in the consultation paper.Sebi is proposing sachetisation of MF “to promote financial inclusion, inculcate the habit of systematic saving and facilitate investment of small savings by investors new to the MF space”. At present, some fund houses offer SIPs with small ticket sizes under some of their schemes.Sebi plans to make it popular and hence has proposed to subsidise the costs for these types of schemes. Sebi will pay some subsidy to the intermediaries — including fund houses, clearing corporations, MF platforms, KRAs, and RTAs — which will help spread these SIPs.Sebi said small-ticket SIPs can be offered in any scheme except for debt schemes, sectoral and thematic schemes, small-cap and mid-cap funds under equity schemes category.“Sachetisation of mutual funds will enable small-ticket investment in mutual funds gradually on a periodic basis. This can assist in financial empowerment of the under-served section of the economy and nudge fund houses to expand their footprints to even remote locations in the country,” the consultation paper said. “While the number of investors participating in mutual funds have grown steadily over the years, there is considerable opportunity for increasing the reach of the mutual funds to all sections of the society, to enable every individual to have access to this financial product.”The consultation paper said that investors would be allowed to invest through up to three Rs 250 SIPs (one each in up to three fund houses). Fund houses are allowed to offer more Rs 250 but will not get any subsidy for those additional ones.Sebi said it would pay an incentive of Rs 500 to distributors and the execution only platforms (EOPs) for getting investors to subscribe to small-ticket SIPs. The incentive should be over and above the distribution commission payable by the fund houses to the distributor, it said. Sebi expects the financial inclusion facilitated under this scheme would break-even for the AMCs within two years.Sebi has sought comments from the public on its proposals by Feb 6. After that it would take the final decision on launching small-ticket SIPs.","Sebi is proposing sachetisation of MF “to promote financial inclusion” Sebi would partially subsidise the costs incurred by all the intermediaries for these small-ticket SIPs.

Car companies to replicate tele tower network,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/car-companies-to-replicate-tele-tower-network/articleshow/117466796.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Car companies are preparing a grid of chargers, similar to telecom towers, to power electric vehicles as top players, such as Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra and JSW MG, start expanding their green offerings.An assessment of preparedness by companies shows almost all manufacturers beefing up the public charging network, including at their own dealerships, and tying up with external vendors. Apart from these initiatives, a customer already gets a home charger.Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing & sales) at Maruti, said creating a charging infrastructure is paramount before the company launches its first EV eVitara. “A customer needs peace of mind and thus, while getting a home charger, he or she will also need access to a robust public charging system, especially when travelling between cities,” he told TOI.While Maruti will target 100 cities in the initial launch phase, it will set up a charging network in around 1,000 cities. “It will be like the set-up of telecom towers. We want to promise after-sales support and charging infra. Customers should travel beyond cities without hassle.”Maruti wants a public charger in a radius of 5-10 km for a customer. “This even when our study says that 95% of existing EVs use home charger.”A robust public charging infra is also needed as over 90% of car users are estimated to not have a fixed parking space. “This means that it will be difficult for them to have a dedicated place for installing home charging and bill metering. Thus, to take EVs mainstream, a strong public charging set-up is required” an industry executive said.Tata Motors, the largest player in the EV segment, has a relatively-bigger network. “TATA.ev has installed over 700 DC and AC fast chargers at dealer outlets across 250+ cities and towns. We also have a home charging network, with 1.4 lakh installations nationwide,” Balaje Rajan, chief strategy officer (Tata Motors’ PV and electric mobility) said.Tata is expanding further through an ‘open collaboration’ framework. “We have partnered with the top eight charge point operators, who have installed more than 10,000 public chargers,” Rajan said.JSW MG has deployed 25,000 charging touchpoints, including public and residential space, CEO Rajeev Chaba said. “Under MG Charge initiative, we are steadily progressing toward our target of 1,000 community charging stations, while our eHub initiative integrates over 7,500 charging points from 30 prominent operators.”Veejay Nakra, Mahindra’s automotive vivision president, said the company is working on setting up ‘semi-public’ chargers with housing societies and office complexes for common EV charging stations. Mahindra is also bullish on the PM e-Drive scheme that proposes to set up an additional 22,100 fast public chargers (60kW and above) in top 40 cities and highways.Companies say govt’s support for oil marketing companies under the FAME 2 scheme will also lead to deployment of another 22,000 chargers.","Top players, such as Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindr and JSW MG, start expanding their green offerings.

Emkay Global Financial Services has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on Hindustan Unilever with a target price of Rs 2,675 (+14%). Despite a sub-par financial performance and muted near-term demand outlook, analysts maintained their positive stance on HUL since they feel in the medium term, the company’s enhanced execution could absorb the impact of macro stress.Elara Securities India has maintained its ‘accumulate’ rating on Dalmia Bharat but target price to Rs 2,023 (+12%) from Rs 2,265 earlier. Analysts believe in the near term, ramp-up of underutilized plants and in the medium-term capacity addition in the high margin market of the Northeast should drive earnings. The cut in target price was to account for the weak volume trend.InCred Equities has given a ‘reduce’ rating on Tata Technologies with a target price of Rs 740 (-7%).

They feel automotive demand trends are consistent while OEMs are holding back spends pending regulatory clarity. They feel the stock’s valuations are turning sane post the ~20% correction in the price since June 2024.Yes Securities has maintained its ‘add’ recommendation on ICICI Prudential Life Insurance but with a reduced target price at Rs 750 (+25%). Analysts feel the life insurer’s value of new business declined materially on sequential basis as product mix evolved negatively, while annual premium equivalent growth was healthy with various businesses contributing.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has maintained its ‘buy’ recommendation on Siemens but cut its target price to Rs 7,500 (+28%) from Rs 8,000 earlier. Analysts cut their estimates to factor in a slower pick-up in digital industries and mobility segment inflows. They do expect near-term order inflow pick-up to be weak for non-energy segments due to a slower-than-expected pick-up in private capex. With an anticipated revival in government capex and an increased focus on exports, they expect Siemens to benefit and emerge as a manufacturing hub for its parent company in the export market going forward.","Emkay Global Financial Services has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on Hindustan Unilever with a target price of Rs 2,675 (+14%).

BENGALURU: The quick commerce industry in India is projected to expand significantly, with HSBC forecasting 5,000-5,500 dark stores operational by fiscal year 2025-26. The sector is expected to achieve a gross order value ranging between $35 billion and $40 billion during the financial year 2027-28, as detailed in HSBC's research findings.Major players such as Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy’s Instamart have aggressively expanded their networks in recent quarters. Blinkit, which is Zomato’s quick commerce business, operates over 1,000 stores as of the December quarter of the 2024-25 financial year and plans to increase this to 2,000 by the end of the fiscal year. The rapid pace at Blinkit included the addition of 216 stores in just one quarter. Similarly, Zepto has grown its network to 850 stores and is expected to cross 1,000 this year. Swiggy's Instamart is also on track to reach 1,000 stores in the near term.According to HSBC, this phase of aggressive expansion is likely nearing its peak. “We believe leading companies like Zepto will focus on optimising capacities after reaching 1,000 stores, while Blinkit and Swiggy are expected to moderate their expansion plans,” the brokerage said in an analyst note released Wednesday. The report also highlighted that by the end of the 2024-25 financial year, the sector’s store capacity will likely be sufficient to meet FY28 throughput expectations. A slowdown in store additions is expected to allow companies to shift their focus towards optimising operations and improving profitability.* ExpectedSource: HSBC","HSBC: 5,000-5,500 dark stores operational by fiscal year 2025-26.

NCW real estate fund raises Rs 1.7k cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ncw-real-estate-fund-raises-rs-1-7k-cr/articleshow/117465944.cms,"Mumbai: Nuvama and Cushman & Wakefield Management (NCW) on Wednesday announced the first close of its prime offices fund at a corpus size of about Rs 1,700 crore. NCW is a first-of-its-kind fund in India that brought together a domestic assets management firm and a global major in the real estate services segment in an industry that is dominated by global giants like Brookfield of Canada and Blackstone of US.The closure of NCW is expected to be at Rs 3,000 crore. NCW is a 50:50 venture with the asset management skills of Nuvama, and operational real estate expertise in leasing and facility management of Cushman & Wakefield are being merged into this single entity.The fund will focus on top graded ‘offices of the future’ across key micro-markets in India's top six cities—Bengaluru, NCR, Pune, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad, Gaurav Puri, chief investment officer, NCW told TOI. The fund would target investments across a portfolio of new developments, as well as completed and leased assets and has already built a robust deal pipeline for deployment, Puri said.During the fund-raising phase, NCW received strong response from a large number of high networth investors (HNIs) and family offices. This is mainly because most of the real estate funds in India are run by foreign majors in which investors are also mostly from abroad. In those funds “domestic Indian investors have very little avenues to invest. That was essentially the gap we foresaw before the JV was inked and before we launched the fund and now,” Puri said.The fund would start fund deployment from the next quarter and expects to be fully deployed (after the final closure) in about two years from now. The overall portfolio target would be about 5-7 million square feet, Puri said.","NCW is a 50:50 venture with the asset management skills of Nuvama, and operational real estate expertise in leasing and facility management of Cushman & Wakefield.

Perplexity CEO Srinivas disagrees with Nilekani’s stance on AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/perplexity-ceo-srinivas-disagrees-with-nilekanis-stance-on-ai-model/articleshow/117467476.cms,"File photo

BENGALURU: AI search engine Perplexity AI cofounder and CEO Aravind Srinivas disagrees with Infosys cofounder and chairman Nandan Nilekani’s stance on bypassing model training skills and instead concentrating on developing applications using pre-existing models. “Nandan Nilekani is awesome, and he's done far more for India than any of us can imagine through Infosys, UPI,” Srinivas acknowledged in a post on X. “But he's wrong in pushing Indians to ignore model training skills and just focus on building on top of existing models. It’s essential to do both.” Perplexity AI closed a $500 million round of funding that tripled the company’s valuation to $9 billion, according to a Bloomberg report last month.In another post, Srinivas pledged his personal support for initiatives aimed at building India’s foundational AI capabilities . “I am ready to invest $1 million personally and 5 hours/week of my time into the most qualified group of people that can do this right now for making India great again in the context of AI,” he wrote. “Consider this as a commitment that cannot be backtracked. The team has to be cracked and obsessed like the DeepSeek team and has to open-source the models with an MIT license.”Srinivas’s vision emphasises the need for a dedicated and highly skilled team to take on the challenge of building globally competitive AI models, underpinned by a commitment to open-source principles. Drawing from his own experiences as a tech entrepreneur, Srinivas expanded on the argument in a follow-up post, where he compared India’s potential in AI to its achievements in space exploration. He noted that India historically excelled in delivering complex projects at a fraction of the cost of its global counterparts, citing Isro’s success as an example. “I feel like India fell into the same trap I did while running Perplexity, thinking models are going to cost a lot of money to train,” Srinivas wrote. “India must show the world that it’s capable of Isro-like feats for AI.”Srinivas pointed to recent advancements by DeepSeek as evidence that significant progress in AI can be achieved without excessive spending. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI startup which unveiled DeepSeek V3, a large language model with 671 billion parameters. The model outperformed Meta’s Llama 3.1 and OpenAI’s GPT-4o in benchmarks for text understanding, coding, and problem-solving, marking a significant milestone for China’s AI sector. He encouraged India to focus on building foundational AI models that are not only effective for Indic languages but also competitive on global benchmarks. “I’m not in a position to run a DeepSeek-like company for India, but I’m happy to help anyone obsessed enough to do it and open-source the models,” he added.Srinivas’s comments highlight a critical juncture for India’s AI ecosystem, as the country grapples with questions of resource allocation and strategic priorities. His argument underscores the importance of developing both foundational model training skills and application-based innovations to position India as a global leader in AI.In a landmark announcement on Wednesday, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank unveiled a joint venture named ""Stargate,"" committing up to $500 billion over the next four years to develop AI infrastructure in the United States. It aims to support the next generation of AI advancements and plans to create about 100,000 jobs.Nilekani has time and again said that India needs to focus on building small language models instead of large language models (LLMs) in the space of generative AI, as the latter has gotten increasingly commoditised. “Foundational models are not the best use of your money. If India has $50 billion to spend, it should certainly build on compute, infrastructure, and AI cloud. These are the raw materials and engines of this game,” he told TOI in an interview last month.In November, Manish Gupta, director of Google Research in India, said that he respectfully disagreed with Nilekani’s advice to India on prioritising use case building over and above building foundational models in artificial intelligence. “He is not preaching what he practised. He revolutionised India’s technology landscape by starting with the basics. With Aadhaar, he did not start with use cases, he started with building foundations. We too must, using our constraints as ingredients for innovation,” Gupta said at the Bengaluru Tech Summit last year.",Aravind Srinivas disagrees with Infosys cofounder and chairman Nandan Nilekani’s stance on bypassing model training skills.

Six Planets Aligned: Seven planets to align in the sky next month: What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/seven-planets-to-align-in-the-sky-next-month-what-it-means/articleshow/117395963.cms,"Seven planets to align in the sky next month (Credits: AP)

NEW DELHI: This January and February, skywatchers will be treated to a rare planetary alignment visible in the night sky. Six planets - Venus, Mars , Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - will be visible on clear nights, with Mercury joining them for a single night in late February, creating a seven-planet alignment, the BBC reported.While not perfectly aligned, the planets will appear in an arc across the sky due to their orbital plane in the Solar System. The brighter planets - Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn - will be visible to the naked eye, while Uranus and Neptune will require binoculars or a telescope to spot.Jenifer Millard, a science communicator and astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in the UK, says, ""There is something special about looking at the planets with your own eyes.""Although some scientists have suggested that planetary alignments might impact Earth , the scientific foundation for most of these claims is weak or non-existent. However, planetary alignments have undoubtedly affected space exploration, particularly when it comes to exploring the Solar System.In 1977, Nasa launched the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft to take advantage of a rare alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which occurs only once every 175 years. This alignment allowed the spacecraft to visit all four planets within a span of just 12 years, instead of the 30 years it would have taken without the alignment.Planetary alignments are also valuable for studying exoplanets and distant galaxies . The transit method, which involves observing a planet passing in front of its star, has led to the discovery of numerous exoplanets, including Earth-sized planets orbiting the red dwarf Trappist-1.Additionally, gravitational lensing, caused by the alignment of massive galaxies or clusters between Earth and distant early galaxies, allows astronomers to study the faint, far-away galaxies in the early universe.While the planetary parade this month depends on perspective, it's possible to imagine an alien civilization observing our Solar System and using similar alignments for their own purposes. As Nick Tusay, a graduate student at Pennsylvania State University, says, ""Perhaps another alien civilization might see this as an opportunity to conduct their own investigations.""","Six planets - Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - will be visible on clear nights.

After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines. The recent launch of a spectacularly successful meme coin helped SOL reach its all-time high yet again. Speculators predict further growth, but several challengers are rising fast.For one, a new TON-based token has the potential to rival this success. Thanks to its significant utility and systemic importance, this token could be a top performer this cycle.After a major rally at the start of the bull market, Solana (SOL) is once again in the headlines. The “Ethereum killer” has attained new highs thanks to a major memecoin launch. Namely, just days before his inauguration, President Donald Trump launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) token. The token quickly attained a staggering valuation of $10 billion, making Trump one of the richest men alive.The token’s launch on Solana has created a market frenzy, pushing Solana to its new ATH at $290. Despite the subsequent volatility, Solana is still up 42% over the past seven days, trading at $254. Now, experts predict that the token can go even higher.The launch of Trump and Melania tokens on the network will likely boost its credibility. At the same time, Trump’s favourable stance toward crypto may prove to be even more consequential. If Solana cements its position as the meme coin hub, it has further potential to expand.Despite Solana’s significant growth, it is not without its challenges. Among them is TON , another high-performance blockchain with several aces up its sleeve. For one, TON has a deep connection with the Telegram messaging app.Telegram provides TON with access to its 950 million users. At the same time, it also enables real-world applications for the network. For one, TON-based apps are becoming more popular on Telegram. For example, popular clicker apps like Notcoin drew significant engagement.TON is also expanding into several new areas. Just in time for the next meme coin rally, TON has revealed a major partnership. Ethereum-based GraFun memecoin launchpad has recently joined the TON platform. This platform will enable the easy creation of meme coins on TON, just as Pump.fun did for Solana.Thanks to these developments, TON emerges as a potential Solana challenger. Moreover, the recent launch of Elluminex (ELX) could further boost its potential. The project aims to be the main trading hub for TON, injecting much-needed liquidity into the chain.Elluminex works as a DEX with cross-chain bridges to 40 major blockchains. This way, it helps bring together liquidity across major chains. This is crucial, as the introduction of major DEXs has had a significant impact on token prices.For instance, since the launch of Raydium, Solana grew from $1.5 to more than $200 in a single year. Ethereum saw similar effects after the launch of Uniswap, as did BNB with PancakeSwap. These examples showcase the importance of liquidity for the chains.Elluminex will also enable low-slippage trading with self-custody, appealing both to large traders and retail players. Thanks to the fact that the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to more than rival Solana’s performance.","After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines.

With a startling $190 trillion worth, the global payments sector is about to undergo a significant change as one viral altcoin is causing waves. The promising project Remittix ( RTX ), which combines blockchain technology with local payment networks, is addressing ongoing cross-border problems like sluggish processing times and excessive costs.But should Cardano (ADA) exhibit indications of a possible recovery, could this fresh rival challenge other top crypto coins and flip ADA's position? Remittix might be the crypto initiative that changes our perspective on cross-border transactions this year. Read on to find out why RTX has the potential to surpass ADA.Rising momentum makes Cardano (ADA) among the top altcoins to keep an eye on this year. Though there were occasional swings, the Cardano price increased more than 16% during the past week, showing a bullish momentum. At first, the Cardano price chart showed a bullish trend with higher highs and higher lows. But a brief bearish breakout saw the altcoin drop to $0.98 before rebounding with great positive momentum, moving it to the $1.09 resistance zone.The Cardano price has been steadily rising over the previous month, rising by more than 16% and keeping a good view among the crypto community. Though it still stands over 65% behind its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10, hope regarding a possible ATH retest in 2025 keeps rising. Reflecting a good blend of stability and growth, Cardano (ADA) noted green days in 53% of the last 30 days.Cardano (ADA) is still among the promising altcoins to watch given its strong fundamentals and bullish investor sentiment. Reiterating the positive sentiment shown on the Cardano price chart, indicators including the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages flash buy signals However, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) currently shows sale signals, indicating a possible pullback. Looking forward, analysts are bullish on Cardano (ADA) in 2025. A recent 2025 Cardano price prediction forecasts that the altcoin could trade in a price channel between $1 and $5 on average this year.Remittix is emerging as a promising project at a time when cross-border transactions are sometimes hampered by hefty fees and delayed processing periods. Moreover, Remittix provides a more affordable, efficient means for individuals and companies to transmit money all around the world by merging local payment systems with blockchain technology, therefore bridging cryptocurrencies and traditional banks.The desire for creative ideas like Remittix has never been stronger since the worldwide remittance market exceeds $750 billion yearly. Among the best crypto investment prospects, Remittix is likely to take a sizable chunk of this fast-growing industry. Meanwhile, Remittix distinguishes itself from conventional financial systems by offering low fees and being transparent.Furthermore, Remittix guarantees users know exactly what they will pay upfront, unlike traditional banking systems loaded with hidden costs, excessive fees, and long delays. Remittix has addressed one of the most enduring issues in global payments by supporting more than forty cryptocurrencies and giving users the option to convert them to fiat and forward them to any bank account anywhere in the world.Remittix is well suited to profit from the rising need for quick, safe, competitively cost cross-border payment solutions. Investors are quite interested in the platform since its presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 252 million RTX tokens in a few weeks. Early buyers have a unique chance to join the presale at a shockingly low price of just $0.0256 per RTX token before the expected launch on tier-1 exchanges in the coming weeks.Remittix (RTX) is fast establishing itself as a game-changer in cross-border payments as the competition for dominance in the crypto arena gets more intense. Moreover, Remittix promises faster, less expensive, and more transparent solutions than conventional banking systems.Additionally, Remittix is a project worth investing in given an increasing presale success and a great chance to take a sizable portion of the $750 billion remittance market. Even though Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting indications of recovery, it is evident that the massive investor demand for the limited RTX token supply is poised to result in exponential gains shortly.Join the Remittix (RTX) presale and community:","Remittix (RTX) is transforming cross-border transactions.

Time to speak openly and plainly

Global Shapers

and decisions about the future

Looking for solutions and social accountability

The protest is small but loud. As limousines drive past, a few hundred young people have gathered on the Postplatz square in Davos, Switzerland.The high-altitude resort in the Alps that usually belongs to skiers looks different this week. Bakeries, cafes, and boutiques have been converted to host banks, companies, or whole countries for the next few days.A pub is now called ""Belgium House."" The old furniture has been cleared out and chic designer furniture and large advertising posters have been put in their place.The demonstrators outside shout ""Eat the rich"" and ""Tax the rich."" Some of them block the street. Their protest is directed at the participants of the World Economic Forum (WEF). They see the meeting, which runs from January 20-24, as a complete waste of money and time.""We are protesting against the lobby meeting of the rich and powerful in Davos. It is clear that they are the ones responsible for the current crises,"" says Mirjam Hostetmann from the youth organization Young Socialists Switzerland, which is connected to the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. The group is helping organize the demonstration under the motto ""Strike WEF.""Ines Yabar has a slightly different view of the event.The young Peruvian was invited as a guest to the World Economic Forum this year. In Lima, she works with others to protect the environment, addresses social problems, and is active as a Global Shaper. This global network of young, committed people between the ages of 20 and 30 is supported by the WEF but organizes itself independently.In Davos, Yabar wants to discuss things with those in power and build bridges, but she also plans to speak plainly. At the same time, she can understand why there are demonstrations outside.""I feel that this shows that young people care and wherever we can we will be protesting because it is important to raise our voice about issues we are passionate about,"" says Yabar. ""But we will also be in rooms where we can talk with people deliberately and intentionally that are making decisions that affect our future.""This year, 50 Global Shapers from around the world will take part in the discussions in Davos.They will discuss social justice , climate change, artificial intelligence (AI) and many other important topics.Being present in Davos is an opportunity for many, especially since many young people are dissatisfied. The current situation cannot continue, says Olajumoke Adekeye.The Nigerian member of the Global Shapers Community is appalled because only 2.8% of the world's parliamentarians are under the age of 30, she says. In sub-Saharan Africa, a large proportion of the population is under 25, but when it comes to decisions that affect their future, they are not heard. And that's why she is here.Indeed, for the next few days her schedule is full. She will need all her energy to meet her mandate of ""seeding ideas about how young people can be empowered to take on greater responsibility.""""Together both the youth within these walls and outside send a strong message that there is really change that can be made,"" says Adekeye, when asked about being a part of a youth delegation inside the WEF while young people protested outside.Akshay Saxena from India also believes in the power of the young and is looking for change.""Too many decisions for the majority are made by a very small group of people,"" he says.He supports young talent through the organization Avanti Fellows where he is co-CEO. They focus on children from poor families who have little access to the education system.""There are so many bright kids, exceptional people, their talent is often wasted,"" he muses. For his work, Saxena is being honored as the Social Entrepreneur of the Year at this year's WEF meeting.""If capitalism is going to work, it is critical that people who own a lot, share some of their wealth. That is their social responsibility,"" he says.Around 70,000 young Indians have taken part in Avanti Fellows' online courses on mathematics, technology, and various science subjects.

""My approach is solution-based,"" he says, pulling a blanket closer to keep himself warm.His gaze wanders over the Swiss mountains. ""Problems should be solved by people who are most affected,"" says Saxena, reflecting on the issues at hand.

Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses due to heightened rivalry from Amazon and Temu.Wesfarmers , which acquired the online retailer for $230million in 2019, issued a closure announcement on Tuesday.According to a Daily Mail report, the company expects an operational deficit reaching $40million in the initial half of 2024-25.“While Catch's financial performance has been challenging, we have gained valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the group's digital transformation and supported the development of the OnePass membership program,” Daily Mail quoted Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott as saying.The company cited intense rivalry from international online retailers such as Temu, Shein, and Amazon.“The recent increase in competitive intensity in the Australian e-commerce sector has affected Catch's financial performance and growth prospects,” according to the announcement.Whilst 100 positions will be preserved and transferred to other Wesfarmers subsidiaries like Kmart, 190 positions will be eliminated.The logistics centres will transition to Kmart's control during the final quarter of 2024-25.Kmart Group Managing Director Ian Bailey indicated the arrangement would enhance customer service through access to Catch's Moorebank warehouse in Sydney's south-west.“Kmart Group can better utilise Catch's fulfilment centres, which are currently less than 50 per cent utilised. The transition will result in faster deliveries to customers at a lower unit cost, while relieving pressure on our busy stores,” he explained.Established by Gabby and Hezi Leibovich as Catch of the Day in 2006, the business gained popularity amongst value-conscious Australian shoppers but ultimately struggled against competitors who faced fewer operational costs and taxes.","Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses.

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900.

Hindenburg's Nate Anderson could face securities fraud charges: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hindenburgs-nate-anderson-could-face-securities-fraud-charges-report/articleshow/117376044.cms,"Nate Anderson , who recently announced the closure of his research firm Hindenburg, faces scrutiny over alleged connections with hedge funds in preparing reports to target companies, reports a Canadian portal citing documents submitted to an Ontario court.Court filings at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice reveal that Moez Kassam, who heads Canada's Anson hedge fund, accepted that his firm has shared research ""with a wide variety of sources"", including Hindenburg's Anderson.According to Market Frauds portal, court documents suggest collaboration between Hindenburg and Anson during report preparation. Such bearish report preparation without proper disclosure of participation could potentially lead to securities fraud charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).""We know for a fact, from the email conversations between Anderson and Anson Funds, that he was indeed working for Anson and published whatever they told him to, from the price target to what should and shouldn't be in the report. He asked them multiple times if they needed 'more'. From what we can see in the dozens of exchanges, at no time did he have editorial control. He was being told what to publish,"" the website claimed.Market Frauds also shared alleged email exchange screenshots between Hindenburg and Anson, which it claims to have obtained from Ontario court documents, to substantiate its allegations.""There are multiple counts of securities fraud for both Anson Funds and Nate Anderson, and we have only gone through 5 per cent of what's in there as of the time of writing. From what we have read so far, it is almost a certainty that when the whole exchange between Hindenburg and Anson reaches the SEC, Nate Anderson will be charged with securities fraud in 2025,"" it said.Short sellers typically borrow securities, sell them in the open market, and aim to repurchase at lower prices following their negative reports. The involvement of hedge funds raises concerns as they might place parallel bets, potentially increasing downward pressure on share prices. Hindenburg Research issued a report in 2020 about Facedrive, a Canadian enterprise that became public via reverse merger, marketing itself as an environmentally conscious ride-sharing service. The report criticised its excessive valuation and generous payments to promoters. Court records indicate Anson communicated with Anderson regarding the report and knew its publication timeline.These legal documents follow a distinct long-term investigation by the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In June, Anson Funds Management and Anson Advisors Inc settled SEC allegations by paying USD 2.25 million, without accepting or denying wrongdoing, for failing to disclose payments to external publishers of negative research.When established, Hindenburg announced receiving ""hundreds of leads each year from diverse sources,"" including sector specialists, informants and fellow investors. ""We rigorously vet each lead and have always maintained full editorial independence over our work.""Anderson announced the closure of Hindenburg Research last week. He gave no specific explanation for his decision but expressed wishes to dedicate more time to personal relationships.""Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking,"" he said in his closure announcement.","Court documents suggest collaboration between Hindenburg and Anson during report preparation.

For next year, the World Bank has estimated growth to be at 6.7%. India will still retain the tag of fastest growing major economy in the world, against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and global policy uncertainty .Several multilateral agencies have revised their growth estimates downwards for India after the National Statistics Office's (NSO) projection showed the economy is expected to expand by 6.4% - the lowest in four years in the current financial year, and sharply below the 8.2% recorded in 2023-24.The sharp slowdown in growth has triggered calls for measures to boost consumption, which some experts say have been hit by stubborn inflationary pressures. Pressures have mounted on the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates to boost growth. The budget is expected to unveil measures to step up growth, amid the backdrop of an uncertain global economy. With respect to the projection in Oct, growth in 2025 for China was marginally revised upward by 0.1 percentage point to 4.6%.Global growth has been projected at 3.3% both in 2025 and 2026, below the historical (2000-19) average of 3.7%. The forecast for 2025 is broadly unchanged from that in Oct 2024 WEO outlook, primarily on account of an upward revision in the US offsetting downward revisions in other major economies, according to IMF.","IMF retained India's growth forecast for 2024-25 at 6.5% but said that growth in the country has slowed more than predicted, led by a sharper-than-expected deceleration in industrial activity.

The aim is to shore up China's own production, reduce any potential job cuts, and prevent foreign investors from fleeing the country if the US imposes new trade barriers, the person said.Apple's main assembly partner Foxconn hasn't been able to dispatch its Chinese staff to India and its factory in the country hasn't been able to receive additional specialised machinery from China, some of the people said. There's been no immediate impact on production though, they said.China's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on Friday the nation ""treats all countries equally and is open to enterprises"" from everywhere. ""China has never done anything that harms interests of other nations to the detriment of itself,"" according to the statement. India's ministry of electronics and information technology and Foxconn didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.India has been crucial to Apple's strategy to lessen its reliance on China amid trade tensions between Washington and Beijing that could escalate further when Trump returns to the White House next week. Foxconn's assembly plant in Chennai accounts for about half of the country's iPhone exports, although the company still makes the bulk of Apple handsets in central China.Beijing doesn't want Foxconn to further diversify its production away to other regions, one of the people said. Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of workers at its Chinese factories, and its large operations are key to local electronics supply chain as well as employment.Rest of World and Nikkei Asia had earlier reported on the Chinese curbs. While the trend of foreign companies shifting away from China started already several years ago, during Trump's first term, the exodus is set to intensify now and could include more technology companies, said Woods Chen, chief economist at Yuanta Securities in Taipei.The restrictions on tech equipment have also had an impact on manufacturing of electric vehicles and solar panels in India, the people said, with the Indian unit of Chinese EV maker BYD and Waaree Energies, India's largest solar-panel maker, affected.BYD's public relations staff and Waaree didn't immediately respond to messages seeking further information.

On corporate jingoism and nationalism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/on-corporate-jingoism-and-nationalism/articleshow/117334089.cms,"AI image (source: ChatGPT)

Jingoism vs nationalism: Understanding the distinction

Role of corporate jingoists and patriots

Value of jingoists and patriots in leadership

Empowering rank and file

Striking right balance

The debate over work-life balance scaled up after L&T chairman SN Subrahmanyan, who proposed a 90-hour work week, including working on Sundays. This suggestion, came after another such call of a 70-hour work week proposed by Infosys co-founder Narayan Murthy, drew sharp criticism from several quarters. Critics called these suggestions an outcome of an exploitative and outdated mindset.The backlash, however, highlights a broader tension in corporate environments between constructive corporate patriotism and blind corporate jingoism . While corporate patriots strive for organisational success by addressing flaws and fostering sustainable growth, corporate jingoists demand unwavering loyalty and relentless work, often disregarding employee well-being and work-life balance. Subrahmanyan’s remarks have ignited discussions about the fine line between dedication to professional excellence and the risk of promoting a culture of burnout and overwork.Jingoism and nationalism, though often conflated, reflect fundamentally different attitudes toward loyalty and identity. Nationalism is a sense of pride and devotion to one’s country, tempered by a broader understanding of its flaws and a desire to improve it. It is grounded in constructive commitment—a belief in the collective good and a willingness to contribute to its advancement. Jingoism, in contrast, is an extreme, often blind allegiance to one’s nation, marked by an unwavering belief in its superiority and infallibility. Jingoists view criticism as disloyalty and often adopt a combative stance toward dissent, fostering an environment of us-versus-them.In the corporate world, these paradigms manifest as corporate jingoists and corporate patriots. Corporate patriots (akin to nationalists) believe in their company’s mission and work to make it better, while acknowledging its flaws and striving for sustainable growth. They are loyal but critical thinkers, engaging with challenges to help the organization evolve. Corporate jingoists, however, see their company as a monolithic entity that can do no wrong. For them, the company is a near-sacred institution deserving of unquestioning allegiance, and their identity is inextricably tied to its success and dominance.While most employees in a company will view their job as a transactional engagement, a minority of corporate jingoists and patriots at senior levels can serve as anchors for the organization’s culture and vision. Corporate jingoists are particularly well-suited to the role of CEO or other cult-like leadership positions. Their unshakable belief in the company’s greatness inspires loyalty, drives bold decision-making, and creates a unifying narrative that galvanizes teams. These leaders embody the company, living and breathing its values with a fervor that transforms them into symbolic figures. Corporate patriots, on the other hand, often populate other senior roles, ensuring that the vision of the jingoistic CEO is tempered by pragmatism and a drive for sustainable progress.For the broader employee base, this leadership dynamic provides a choice. As they traverse their career paths—often moving between companies every few years—they can decide how deeply they want to engage. They may choose to adopt the passion of a corporate nationalist, commit fully as a jingoist, or treat their role as a stepping stone, viewing the company as just another employer. Each choice is valid, but it is the visibility of jingoistic leadership that serves as a litmus test for potential allegiance. By showcasing such passionate devotion at the top, companies provide employees the opportunity to reflect on their own alignment with the organization’s culture and values.This balance between jingoists and patriots at senior levels, coupled with the freedom of the rank and file to decide their own level of engagement, creates a healthy organizational ecosystem. The jingoist CEO ensures the company’s identity remains strong and uncompromising, while corporate patriots and rank-and-file pragmatists provide the critical thinking and operational flexibility necessary for sustained success. Together, they form a dynamic system that allows companies to cultivate loyalty where it matters most, while leaving room for individual autonomy and career mobility.","The debate over work-life balance scaled up after L&T chairman SN Subrahmanyan proposed a 90-hour work week, including working on Sundays.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

What are the new bank nomination rules? Top points

According to the revised provisions, account holders can nominate up to four individuals, either simultaneous or in succession - a step that will facilitate a straightforward claim settlement process for both depositors and nominees.

Account holders have the choice to select either simultaneous or successive nominations based on their requirements.

Up to four nominees can be designated by depositors, with specific allocation of shares or percentages for each, totalling 100 per cent, which ensures clear distribution amongst all nominees.

For deposits, articles in safe custody, or lockers, individuals can specify up to four nominees. The subsequent nominee becomes active only after the death of the higher-placed nominee, ensuring seamless settlement and succession clarity.

For items kept in safe custody and safety deposit lockers, the regulations permit only successive nominations.





New bank nomination rules 2025: There is good news for bank customers! From November 1, 2025 you can now add up to four nominees to your bank accounts. From November 2025, banking customers will have the flexibility to opt for up to four nominees for their accounts. The move is aimed at standardising and streamlining claim settlements across banks.According to a PTI report, the finance ministry has said that key nomination provisions within the Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2025 will come into effect from November 1, 2025.The Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2025, which was notified on April 15, 2025, includes 19 amendments across five legislative frameworks: the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, Banking Regulation Act, 1949, State Bank of India Act, 1955, and Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 and 1980.These provisions allow depositors flexibility in making nominations according to their preferences, whilst maintaining uniformity, transparency and efficiency in claim settlements across the banking sector.The Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 2025, which will outline procedures and forms for making, cancelling, or designating multiple nominations, will be issued to implement these provisions across banks.""The central government had earlier appointed August 1, 2025 as the date on which certain provisions of the said Amendment Act, namely Sections 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, came into force vide Gazette Notification S.O. 3494(E) dated 29th July 2025,"" it said.","Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2025 will come into effect from November 1, 2025.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices sustained their bullish trajectory for the fourth consecutive week, propelled by robust global market cues and strong Q2FY26 earnings momentum. Additionally, renewed optimism surrounding the advanced stages of India–US trade pact negotiations further underpinned investor sentiment and amplified risk-on appetite across equities.The Nifty extended its winning streak for the sixth consecutive session on Thursday, closing at a fresh 52-week high near the 25,900 marks. However, it’s noteworthy that after a sharp 1,500-point rally over the past four weeks, the stochastic oscillator on both daily and weekly charts has entered the overbought zone. This suggests the potential for a short-term consolidation or corrective pause at higher levels — a healthy development that could set the stage for the next leg of the uptrend.Given the prevailing global volatility and the ongoing earnings season, any dip from current levels should be viewed as a buying opportunity to accumulate fundamentally robust counters with strong earnings visibility. On the downside, the zone of 25,500–25,700 is expected to act as a strong demand area, coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the ongoing rally (24,587–25,782) and the recent breakout region — thus providing a solid technical support base.Our constructive outlook is further reinforced by the following developments: After the strong performances in the Auto and Metal sectors, the Bank Nifty has now registered a fresh all-time high, signaling renewed sectoral strength. This broad-based participation is expected to lend additional momentum to the benchmark Nifty, potentially propelling it towards 26,277 — the prior all-time high — and subsequently to 26,600 in the coming month, which represents the measured move target derived from the breakout of the three-month symmetrical triangle consolidation pattern.Key Factors to Monitor Going Forward:Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows in all time frames. The index during the week has rallied to a fresh all-time high of 58577 levels.Going forward, the index is expected to sustain its upward trajectory, with immediate support placed at 57,500-57600 levels being the last week breakout area and a stronger demand zone seen near 56,800-56,500 levels.On the higher side, resistance is envisaged around 59000 levels being the 138.2% retracement of the entire previous decline (57628-53561).From an oscillator perspective, the Stochastic indicator has reversed upward and is nearing the overbought territory, suggesting a possible phase of consolidation with a positive undertone.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling supply line joining highs of the last 2-3 months signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is seen sustaining above the 20- & 50-days EMA highlighting short term momentum returning in the stock. It has immediate support at current week low of 144.We expect the stock to move higher towards 168 levels in the coming month being the 50% retracement of the entire decline of last 4 months (198-136)The stock is forming base at the 80% retracement of the previous major up move of May-June 2025 and has witnessed a shallow retracement of its previous up move signaling overall positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to resume its move and head towards 380 levels in the coming month being the confluence of the 200 day EMA and 50% retirement of the previous decline (417-337).Among the oscillators the daily 14 periods RSI is in up move and is sustaining above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 24, 2025 are Inox Wind, and Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services.

"Reliance, PSU refineries look to suspend Russian oil imports on US curbs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-psu-refineries-look-to-suspend-russian-oil-imports-on-us-curbs/articleshow/124767849.cms,"Representational AI image

""They are going to stop..."" Trump Reiterates Claim That India Is Cutting Down Russian Oil Imports





NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports after the US on Wednesday sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, the largest exporters of those barrels.Reliance, the single-largest Indian consumer of Russian oil, will be the biggest loser as it buys most of those barrels directly from Rosneft under a term contract. Russian crude makes up about half of the feed at the company's 35-million-tonne complex.“Recalibration of Russian oil imports is ongoing and Reliance will be fully aligned to GOI (Government of India) guidelines,” a Reliance spokesman told Reuters.The curbs on Rosneft will also make life harder for Nayara Energy, which is half owned by the Russian giant and struggling to stay afloat since September when the EU imposed sanctions. Analysts said selling products from its 20-million-tonne refinery at Gujarat's Vadinar will be tough.Importers can receive contracted shipments till November 21. Unlike previous sanctions, when Russian oil could be traded within the $60 price cap, this time the curbs are directed at the companies, making their barrel tainted after the cut-off date.So far this year, 36% of India’s crude has been from Russia, with Rosneft and Lukoil supplying nearly 60% of this.A senior executive of IndianOil, one of the largest consumers of Russian oil among state-run refiners, said those barrels make up 15-18% of their crude basket.“It is too early. We are looking at the fine print. But it will not be too difficult to arrange alternative supplies from West Asia or other geographies such as Africa, the US etc. But others will also be crowding those markets, which will jack up benchmark prices and premia on other crude. This will impact margins. But Russian oil somehow finds its way into the market as we have seen in the past… but banking issues may crop up,” he said.Sure enough, benchmark Brent crude price shot up 5%, or by $2.9 a barrel, to 65.50 on Thursday. ""The good thing is prices are in their 60s. Even if they rise to $70, it will be manageable.""US President Donald Trump has been mounting pressure on countries such as India and China to lower oil imports from Russia as part of a plan to squeeze Moscow to come to the negotiating table on the Ukraine conflict. Trump imposed secondary tariffs of 25% on India, in addition to 25% reciprocal tariffs, citing Russian crude purchases.Late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hit back at the US. “This is, of course, an attempt to put pressure on Russia. But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure.” He said breaking the balance in the global energy markets could lead to a hike in prices that would be uncomfortable for countries such as the US.As a country, the loss of discounted Russian oil could potentially cost India, which meets 85% of its crude requirement through imports, an estimated annual savings of about $4-5 billion on its oil import bill. Ratings agency ICRA estimates that replacement supplies at market prices would increase the oil import bill by 2%, potentially impacting the macroeconomic parameters.Sumit Ritolia, analyst at global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler, said the term arrangement with Rosneft could “introduce some near-term friction, especially from a compliance standpoint for RIL. The company would understandably wish to avoid any exposure to OFAC (US Office of Foreign Assets Control) and it will need to look at its Russian crude strategy.”The immediate operational impact on state-run refiners, he said, ""should remain limited"" as they buy Russian crude through tender from third-party traders. “However, secondary sanctions related to logistics and financing could pose indirect challenges.”","Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports.

'Egregious behavior': Trump says he's ending trade talks with Canada over TV ads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/egregious-behavior-trump-says-hes-ending-trade-talks-with-canada-over-tv-ads-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/124776027.cms,"Donald Trump, Mark Carney (AP)

'TERMINATED': Huge Escalation Between Canada & U.S; Trump Retaliates After Carney Junks America





US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he is halting all trade negotiations with Canada, citing television advertisements he said were intended to influence American court decisions.President Trump described the ads as “egregious behavior” and accused Canada of misusing footage of former President Ronald Reagan . “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,” he said in a post on Truth Social.“Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump added.Earlier this week, Trump said he had seen the ad on television and interpreted it as evidence that his tariffs were making an impact.The move follows remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who said he plans to double Canada’s exports to markets outside the US in response to the threat posed by Trump’s tariffs.The advertisement, launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government for $75 million highlights former President Ronald Reagan’s warning about the harm of tariffs.The 60-second TV spot features workers, such as welders and bakers, as well as families, while using Reagan’s 1987 radio address, in which he stated that trade barriers hurt all American workers and consumers, as cited by the Globe and Mail.“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” Reagan says.“Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs. Throughout the world, there’s a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition,” Reagan says in the advertisement.Ford revealed the $ 75 million price tag for the ads during a speech earlier this month at the Empire Club of Canada luncheon in downtown Toronto. He added that the province plans to deliver the message “to every Republican district” across the United States.“We’re just going to speak the truth,” Ford said. “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad. It’s actually just very factual. Coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”The Ronald Reagan Foundation dismissed the ad as a ""misrepresentation"" and said it is reviewing legal options to challenge its use.“The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal option in this matter,” the Foundation said through a post on X.","US President Donald Trump announced that he is halting all trade negotiations with Canada.

"Hunting e-waste: India pushes for recycling of critical minerals; dismantlers, crushers, and shredders to join chain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hunting-e-waste-india-pushes-for-recycling-of-critical-minerals-dismantlers-crushers-and-shredders-to-join-chain/articleshow/124821185.cms,"



India is gearing up to transform its electronic waste into a major source of critical minerals, as the ministry of mines intensifies collaboration with private players to build large-scale recycling capacity across the country.The ministry is working closely with private industry to expand the country’s recycling capacity, aiming to fully process electronic waste and recover critical minerals within the next few years, it said in a press release issued on Friday.This initiative follows the Union Cabinet’s approval of a Rs 1,500 crore Incentive Scheme for Critical Mineral Recycling on September 3, which is an important part of the National Critical Mineral Mission. The scheme seeks to promote the recovery of key materials through recycling, reducing India’s dependence on imports.After consultations with industry representatives, the ministry issued detailed guidelines for the scheme on October 2.The application process also began the same day. According to the statement, the quick rollout received a positive response from stakeholders, with several expressing interest in participating.Under the scheme, eligible feedstock includes e-waste, used lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and catalytic converters from end-of-life vehicles. Data from the ministry shows that India generates about 1.75 million tonnes of e-waste and 60 kilo tonnes of spent LIBs every year. With customs duty on LIB scrap removed in the 2025–26 Union Budget, imports of such material are expected to rise, broadening recycling opportunities over the next four to five years.Feedstock collection will also strengthen under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework, which makes producers accountable for collecting and recycling e-waste and battery waste.At present, most of the material known as “black mass,” a powder containing valuable metals, is exported because of limited domestic processing capacity. The new incentive scheme will specifically support recyclers engaged in mineral extraction, including lithium, cobalt, and nickel, while encouraging dismantlers, crushers, and shredders to join the formal recycling chain.Only a small number of companies in India currently operate full end-to-end, or R4, recycling systems capable of converting battery scrap into metals. To enable wider participation, incentives have been capped at Rs 50 crore for large recyclers and Rs 25 crore for smaller ones.The ministry said the programme will enhance recycling capability through proven technologies such as hydrometallurgy. Research institutions, including IITs and CSIR laboratories, have already developed indigenous processes for metal recovery and purification. These institutes are also providing training in mineral extraction and processing, ensuring that any skill requirements arising from the scheme can be met through collaboration between academia and industry.","India is gearing up to transform its electronic waste into a major source of critical minerals.

US Fed rate cuts: America might still see another rate cut in 2025; govt shutdown clouds economic outlook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-rate-cuts-america-might-still-see-another-rate-cut-in-2025-govt-shutdown-clouds-economic-outlook/articleshow/124821490.cms,"



The US may see another rate cut this year, even as uncertainty looms over the economy due to the ongoing US government shutdown.The Federal Reserve's second-to-last rate meeting of 2025 takes place amid a standoff between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare subsidies, which has halted the publication of nearly all official economic data. Without these insights, officials must decide on interest rates without the comprehensive information they usually rely upon.Analysts expect the Fed to proceed with a quarter percentage-point cut, lowering its key lending rate to between 3.75 and 4.00%, while remaining cautious about signalling any final rate move in December.The shutdown has intensified debate within the Fed. Policymakers are weighing whether to cut rates quickly to support a weakening labour market or hold steady in the face of inflation that remains stubbornly above the bank’s long-term target of 2%, partly driven by Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on major trading partners.""They'll have to decide how much (inflation) is still to come versus how much is just never going to come, and that's the big question right now,"" former Fed official Joseph Gagnon told AFP. He added that “the strength and inflation is only temporary... but the weakness of unemployment might be more long lasting.”""In my view, that argument is going to continue to hold sway this month, because the data are still in that direction,"" Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), said.Since the shutdown began on October 1, the only major data released was US consumer inflation, which showed a 3% rise over the year to September, slightly below expectations. The news buoyed financial markets, with stocks closing at fresh records.The Fed, however, relies on a different inflation measure, which remains well above its target according to pre-shutdown data.Employment has also slowed in recent months, with only 22,000 jobs added in August, although the unemployment rate remained low at 4.3%.""The goal is to get it just right, and that's a hard thing to do with such a blunt tool,"" KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk told AFP, referring to the Fed’s key interest rate. Swonk expects two more rate cuts this year and predicts the central bank will also announce an end to its quantitative tightening programme next week amid rising liquidity risks.Political pressures have added to the Fed’s challenges. President Trump has repeatedly attacked chair Jerome Powell on his Truth Social platform and has also sought to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud.Cook has contested the removal, taking the case to the US Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear arguments in January.

"Investing in gold ETFs: Sudden slide after 27% surge, how should investors proceed?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investing-in-gold-etfs-sudden-slide-after-27-surge-how-should-investors-proceed/articleshow/124821299.cms,"Top performers

Long term outlook

How should investors proceed?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have delivered solid returns over the past three months, with some funds gaining as much as 27%. However, recent trading sessions have seen heightened volatility, as investors rush to book their profits, after the yellow metal extended the rally it began in April 2025.Gold ETFs are funds that mirror the price of physical gold, with each unit typically equivalent to one gram. They are traded on stock exchanges and can be purchased or sold via a demat and trading account.Satish Dondapati, fund manager at Kotak Mutual Fund told ET, “The rally, which began in April 2025, has been supported by expectations of a potential US Federal Reserve rate cut, heightened geopolitical tensions, robust investment demand, and continued central bank accumulation. The most recent $250–$300 upswing was largely driven by increased safe-haven buying amid concerns over the ongoing US government shutdown. ”Dondapati added that gold prices have recently corrected, as investors booked gains following a nearly 25% rally over two months. The retracement was further influenced by a rise in US bond yields and a stronger dollar.Over the past three months, UTI Gold ETF led gains with a 27.19% return, followed by LIC MF Gold ETF at 23.40%.Kotak Gold ETF returned 22.96%, while Nippon India ETF Gold BeES, the oldest and largest gold ETF, delivered 22.94%. Tata Gold ETF recorded the lowest return in the period, at 22.25%.However, in the last two weeks, returns have slowed considerably, averaging 0.70%.UTI Gold ETF again outperformed with a 4.26% gain, while Aditya Birla Sun Life Gold ETF lagged at 0.12%. The last week saw sharper declines, with gold ETFs falling up to 7%, averaging a 6.11% loss. Tata Gold ETF was hit hardest with a 6.81% drop, and UTI Gold ETF saw the smallest decline of 2.64%.On 24 October, gold futures for December delivery on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) slipped by Rs 533, or 0.43%, to Rs 1,23,571 per 10 grams, while silver futures dropped Rs 1,386, or 0.93%, to Rs 1,47,126 per kilogram. The decline was driven by a mix of global signals and cautious market sentiment ahead of key economic data, prompting traders to lock in profits at higher levels.Despite recent short-term fluctuations, Dondapati stressed that the fundamental drivers for gold remain strong. Dondapati added that in the near term, gold is likely to remain volatile due to uncertainty surrounding global trade policies and the US shutdown, ET reported.“However, in the medium to long term, the key structural drivers for gold remain intact — including elevated global debt levels, persistent central bank demand, and ongoing geopolitical and inflationary pressures.”Adding to global sentiment, billionaire investor Ray Dalio noted on X that US sanctions on Russia’s oil giants could have broad financial consequences, potentially weakening the dollar and boosting gold. Dalio described gold as a “non-fiat currency” that “remains securely held and universally accepted,” historically appreciating during periods of currency stress and low interest rates.For investors, Dondapati recommended a cautious approach.Rather than investing in a lump sum, he suggests phased investments through systematic investment plans (SIPs) or systematic transfer plans (STPs) in gold ETFs or gold mutual funds, tailored to individual risk profiles and asset allocation strategies.","Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have delivered solid returns over the past three months.

MUMBAI: Federal Bank chief KVS Manian said that the recently-announced capital raise from private equity investor Blackstone will give the lender flexibility to consider acquisitions to support growth, after the board approved a preferential issue of warrants to the US asset manager on Oct 24 in Kochi.The bank approved the issue of warrants representing up to 9.99% of its post-issue paid-up share capital to funds managed by Blackstone. The issue is priced at Rs 227 a share, at an 8% premium to the regulatory floor price, resulting in a committed capital infusion of Rs 6,196.5 crore. Blackstone will be entitled to a board seat on full conversion of the warrants, subject to its holding not falling below 5%. The bank said the transaction will need approvals from shareholders and regulators.The funds will strengthen capital adequacy and support both organic and inorganic expansion. The lender aims to advance its plan to rank among the top five private sector banks in India after the capital issue.Manian said the arrangement “is a strong vote of confidence in our team, our 95-year legacy of trust, and our strategy to emerge among the top private sector banks in India.” He said the structure “ensures capital availability aligned to our growth milestones, without immediate dilution.”He added that Blackstone “brings deep operating experience and access to their significant India portfolio,” supporting efforts to expand the bank’s digital and national presence. He said the capital raise improves flexibility to evaluate acquisitions “should the right fit arise.”Blackstone senior managing director Mukesh Mehta said the partnership shows its conviction in the bank’s franchise and in the growth potential of Indian banking. He said Blackstone will work with Manian and the management team “to position the bank for long-term success and to help it become one of India’s leading private sector banks.”The bank has focused on profitable growth and a stronger balance sheet in recent years. Its CASA ratio reached 31.0% in Q2FY26. Total deposits rose 7.3% year-on-year to Rs 2,88,919 crore. Net interest income stood at Rs 2,495 crore and fee income at Rs 886 crore in the quarter.

NEW DELHI: The department of financial services (DFS) in the finance ministry and govt's policy think tank Niti Aayog have no role in the investment decisions of LIC, and the investment guidelines of the state-owned company are governed by board-approved policies, officials said on Saturday, adding that the insurer's exposure to the Adani Group is far less than to other conglomerates.LIC's investment in the Tata Group is estimated at Rs 1.3 lakh crore, while the exposure to the Aditya Birla Group is Rs 42,600 crore.On equity side, LIC owns 4% of Adani stocks (Rs 60,000 crore), compared with 6.9% (Rs 1.3 lakh crore) in Reliance, 15.9% (Rs 82,800 crore) in ITC, 4.9% (Rs 64,725 crore) in HDFC Bank & 9.6% (Rs 79,361 crore) in SBI, officials emphasised.Speaking on condition of anonymity, officials expressed suspicions about the timing of the allegations levelled by Washington Post. Coming at a time when GST reforms have triggered record-breaking sales in the festive season, it could well have been timed to destabilise a robust economy.They rejected allegations levelled by Washington Post that govt officials had drafted plans to steer billions of dollars of LIC funds into Adani Group companies, adding that LIC is a listed company and its investments are subjected to regulatory oversight of independent regulatory authorities such as stock market regulator Sebi and insurance watchdog IRDAI.They said LIC has been investing in various companies and groups, and it is a routine process for such a large investment conglomerate. LIC, which is managing over Rs 55 lakh crore, invests in equities and debt instruments based on the market and interest outlook, asset-liability management objectives, its fund requirements and the overall objective of optimising returns for stakeholders.While LIC's annual investment is around Rs 5.5 lakh crore, investments mentioned in the Washington Post report were less than 1% of the total annual investment. Arguing that this wasn't the first instance of the insurer being the sole bidder, officials said the public sector behemoth participated in online bids for the Rs 5,000 crore bond issue by Adani Ports and SEZ as they enjoyed AAA rating, after taking necessary approvals. It did not invest in bonds of Adani Green, they added.""LIC's investments follow the guidelines prescribed in a very transparent manner and are concurrently audited by independent auditors, reviewed by the board as well as IRDAI, the regulator, and they are reported in the manner required under public disclosure formats of IRDAI,"" said an official.","LIC's investment in the Tata Group is estimated at Rs 1.3 lakh crore, while the exposure to the Aditya Birla Group is Rs 42,600 crore.

Gold and silver prices lost their festive sparkle this week, snapping a nine-week rally as investors booked profits amid a strong dollar, easing geopolitical tensions, and falling global prices.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), December gold futures dropped Rs 3,557, or 2.80 per cent, to close at Rs 1,23,451 per 10 grams on Friday, while silver plunged Rs 9,134, or 5.83 per cent, to settle at Rs 1,47,470 per kg.Both metals had surged since late August, with gold hitting a record Rs 1,32,294 per 10 grams and silver peaking at Rs 1,70,415 per kg on October 17.Since those peaks, gold has lost Rs 8,843 (6.68%) and silver Rs 22,945 (13.46%), according to news agency PTI.In international markets, Comex gold touched a lifetime high of $4,398 per ounce on Monday, before falling $266.4, or 6.11 per cent, on Tuesday—the steepest one-day decline in over a decade.Silver futures on Comex similarly retreated from a record $53.76 per ounce to $47.12 per ounce by October 21, marking their sharpest single-day drop since 2021.Mahendra Patil, founder of MP Financial Advisory Services LLP, said the steep gold correction was triggered by profit-booking and a post-Diwali slowdown in domestic demand.“Global gold ETFs also recorded net outflows in mid-October after a surge in inflows during September. The redemptions signalled short-term profit-taking, reducing institutional demand for bullion,” he noted, as per PTI.N S Ramaswamy, head of commodities & CRM at Ventura, added that while physical jewellery purchases have slowed after Diwali, digital safe-haven demand remains robust. “We anticipate a revival in demand for the upcoming wedding season,” he said.For silver, Ramaswamy highlighted that speculative positions unwinding, alongside a stronger US dollar and easing geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, contributed to the correction.As per PTI, Pankaj Singh, investment manager at SmartWealth.ai, described the decline as a natural market adjustment following speculative demand and supply constraints, noting, “The structural case for precious metals remains firm, driven by central bank purchases and inflation hedging demand.”Overall, the price pullback is seen by experts as a consolidation phase rather than a market capitulation, providing a pause after a sustained nine-week rally.","Gold and silver prices lost their festive sparkle this week, snapping a nine- week rally.

Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"

Canada’s Reagan Ad ‘Trump Card’ Ends U.S. Trade Talks | What Is Trump So Angry About





US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he is increasing tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10 per cent, in response to a Canadian advertisement featuring late US leader Ronald Reagan The move comes just two days after Trump ""ended"" all trade talks with Canada, criticising what he called a “fake” ad campaign.On his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: ""Their advertisement was to be taken down immediately, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a fraud. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.""The ad, produced by the Canadian province of Ontario, used quotes from a 1987 radio address by Reagan in which he warned that high tariffs could provoke retaliation from other countries and trigger trade wars. The quotes match the transcript available on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library’s website.The Reagan Foundation criticised the ad, stating that it used “selective audio and video” and is reviewing potential legal options.Trump’s sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos have already affected Canada’s economy, causing job losses and straining businesses. Despite this, the United States and Canada continue to operate under the USMCA trade agreement, which allows roughly 85 per cent of cross-border trade to remain tariff-free.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking on Wednesday, described the US tariffs as “levels last seen during the Great Depression” and stressed that Canada’s economic strategy would need significant adjustments, a process that would take time and sacrifices.","US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he is increasing tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10 per cent.

You see the risks here for Europe and its most strategic industrial sectors,” von der Leyen said at the Berlin Global Dialogue, warning of the economic impact of China’s controls.She emphasised that the EU will focus on recycling, production, and post-processing of critical raw materials, noting that some companies can recycle up to 95% of materials from products and batteries, as per news agency AFP.The REsourceEU plan will also accelerate partnerships with countries such as Australia, Canada, Chile, Greenland, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine, aiming to diversify supply chains and reduce Europe’s vulnerability.The EU intends to follow a model similar to REPowerEU, the 2022 plan that reduced dependence on Russian fossil fuels through investments, diversification, and legislative measures.Von der Leyen acknowledged the need for short-term engagement with Chinese counterparts but stressed that the EU is prepared to deploy all available tools, including the Anti-Coercion Instrument, if necessary, to counter potential economic coercion.She described China’s recent moves as “clear acceleration and escalation in the way interdependencies are leveraged and weaponized”, as per Politico.The EU’s new initiative highlights a strategic pivot to secure supply chains for high-tech and defence sectors, balancing short-term resilience with long-term industrial independence.The bloc aims to exploit circular economy opportunities and accelerate domestic production to mitigate risks from over-reliance on a single supplier.Overall, the REsourceEU plan seeks to ensure Europe’s industries have reliable access to critical raw materials in the short, medium, and long term, strengthening economic and technological security while reducing exposure to geopolitical leverage from China.","EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc is preparing a new strategy, named RESourceEU, to secure alternative sources of these minerals.

Pakistan’s economy collapsing? Public debt rises to $286.8 billion; debt-to-GDP ratio hits 70%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistans-economy-collapsing-public-debt-rises-to-286-8-billion-debt-to-gdp-ratio-hits-70/articleshow/124809439.cms,"Representative image





Pakistan’s total public debt reached $286.832 billion (PKR 80.6 trillion) as of June 2025, almost 13% higher than the previous year, according to official data released by the ministry of finance in its Annual Debt Review for FY25.Of this, domestic debt stood at PKR 54.5 trillion while external debt was PKR 26.0 trillion, according to news agency PTI.The data showed the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to around 70% in June 2025, up from 68% a year earlier.The report attributed the rise primarily to lower-than-expected nominal GDP growth, with subdued inflation slowing economic expansion despite fiscal consolidation efforts.Domestic debt rose 15% year-on-year—the lowest increase in three fiscal years—while external debt increased by 6% to $91.8 billion.The external debt growth was supported by disbursements from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an ADB-guarantee-backed commercial loan of $1 billion, and inflows from other multilateral institutions, as per PTI.Provincial debt also increased, with Pakistan’s Punjab as the largest borrower at $6.18 billion (7%), followed by Sindh at $4.67 billion (5%), which recorded the sharpest rise.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s debt reached $2.77 billion, Baluchistan $371 million, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir $281 million.Overall, 84% of external public debt is held by the federal government and 16% by provinces.Pakistan’s economy has been gradually recovering after two years of instability. The IMF had recently reached a staff-level agreement with Islamabad on loan programmes, enabling access to $1.2 billion under its Extended Fund Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility, pending board approval.The agreement aims to strengthen macroeconomic stability, rebuild market confidence, and support fiscal and structural reforms.The Economic Survey 2024–25 had indicated Pakistan’s economy grew 2.5% in 2024, with projected 2.7% growth for 2025.Fiscal improvements included a current account surplus of $1.9 billion during July–April FY25, and rising remittances estimated at $37–38 billion by year-end.The survey also noted external reserves had increased to $16.64 billion by June 2025, reflecting improved investor confidence and global ratings upgrades.","Pakistan’s total public debt reached $286.832 billion (PKR 80.6 trillion) as of June 2025.

Why “inflation slows” doesn’t mean “crisis over”

The bottom line





For almost two years, prices in the United States have been climbing faster than most people’s paychecks. Groceries, rent, fuel, and electricity all went up, squeezing budgets and forcing families to cut back. Now there’s finally a bit of good news: inflation is slowing. Prices in September rose 3% compared to a year earlier, a little less than what experts had expected.That may sound like a small change, but it matters. It suggests that the wave of high prices that began during the pandemic could finally be losing strength. For Americans, it might mean cheaper loans and a little more stability in household budgets. For the rest of the world, including India, it’s a sign that the global economy may be settling after years of turmoil.Still, prices are not falling, only rising more slowly. Inflation remains above what the US Federal Reserve considers healthy, so the question now is whether this slowdown will last long enough for the Fed to start cutting interest rates.In September 2025, prices in the US went up 3% from a year earlier, slightly below forecasts of 3.1%. On a month-to-month basis, they rose about 0.3%. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel, stayed steady at around 3%.Inflation has come a long way down from its pandemic peak of over 8%, but it’s still higher than the Fed’s goal of around 2%. The latest numbers show progress but also caution: the fight against rising prices is slowing, not over.: If inflation keeps easing, the Fed may cut interest rates soon. That could make home loans, car loans, and business borrowing cheaper.When inflation slows, your money holds its value better, so you can buy more with the same amount.: Lower prices can boost spending, helping shops, companies, and jobs.Around the world: The US is the world’s biggest economy. When its inflation changes, it affects currencies, trade, and commodity prices everywhere — including India.The inflation report for September came out later than usual because of a short government shutdown. When it was finally released, it showed prices rising a little less than expected.Earlier forecasts had suggested that tariffs on imports and high energy costs might push prices up again. But both stabilised, and that helped keep inflation in check.After the pandemic, supply chains broke down and goods became scarce. At the same time, governments pumped money into the economy to keep people afloat. The result was a sharp jump in prices across almost everything.By 2022, inflation in the US was above 8%. To slow it, the Fed raised interest rates, which made loans costlier and cooled spending. That strategy worked: inflation dropped through 2023 and 2024.By mid-2025, inflation had settled near 2.7%, but new import taxes and rising service costs caused a small rebound. Now, it seems to be easing again. Some economists think 3% could become the “new normal” — slightly higher than before the pandemic, but stable enough for steady growth.The central bank will decide whether to cut interest rates or wait for more data.: If job growth slows and people spend less, rate cuts become more likely.: New import taxes could still make certain goods costlier.: Other big economies are also seeing around 3% inflation, which could shape trade and investment patterns.It’s encouraging that inflation is cooling, but it’s not over yet. Prices are still rising, just not as quickly. Everyday costs like rent, healthcare, and groceries remain high for many families. And inflation could climb again if oil prices or tariffs rise.In short, inflation slowing is a relief, not a rescue.Inflation at 3% shows progress, not perfection. The US has avoided the runaway prices of the pandemic years, but stability is still some distance away.The Fed’s next move — whether to cut or hold rates — will decide how quickly the world’s biggest economy regains its balance. For now, things are moving in the right direction. If this trend continues, cheaper loans and steadier prices could soon follow.","Prices in September rose 3% compared to a year earlier, a little less than what experts had expected.

Trump ‘FRUSTRATED’ With Carney; Aide Reveals Real Reason Behind US-Canada Trade Talks Fall

.

Canadian officials respond to tariffs





Canada on Friday said that it will pause the anti-tariff advertisement campaign that prompted US President Donald Trump to abruptly end trade negotiations, as confirmed by Ontario Premier Doug Ford.Ford said the decision comes after discussions with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the campaign will be paused from Monday to allow talks to resume, news agency AP reported.“Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said.Despite the controversy, he added that the ad would continue to air over the weekend, including during the first World Series games featuring the Toronto Blue Jays.“I’ve directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games,” he said.Ford acknowledged that Trump had likely seen the ad and said, “I’m sure he wasn’t too happy.”The Ontario premier added that the aim was to “blast” the pro-trade message to Americans.“It’s real, because it was coming from the best president the country’s ever seen, Ronald Reagan . I feel the Reagan Republicans are going to be fighting with the MAGA group, and let's hope Reagan Republicans win,” Ford said.The 60-second ad featured edited clips from Reagan’s April 25, 1987 national radio address, where he spoke passionately in favour of free and fair trade and warned against the dangers of tariffs.In the speech, Reagan said the US had “clear evidence that Japanese companies were engaging in unfair trade practices,” but stressed he was “loath” to impose tariffs, warning that they hurt workers and fuelled trade wars.Trump on Friday indicated that he does not plan to meet with Mark Carney ahead of his trip to Asia.Speaking to reporter about the advertisement, Trump said: “What they did is really dishonest. And I heard they were pulling the ad. I didn't know they were putting it on a little bit more. They could have pulled it tonight.”""Well, that's dirty playing, but I can play dirtier than they can,"" he added.Earlier, Trump had criticised the ad on social media, calling it “fake” and accusing Canada of misusing Reagan’s words to influence American policy.He also linked the ad to an upcoming US Supreme Court ruling on his global tariff regime and declared an immediate halt to trade talks.In a post on Truth Social, he wrote: “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.”“Based on their egregious behavior, all trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated,” his post added.The Ronald Reagan Foundation echoed Trump’s criticism, calling the ad a “misrepresentation” and said it is reviewing legal options.""The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal option in this matter,” the Foundation wrote in a post on X.White House spokesman Kush Desai said talks with Canada had not produced constructive results.“Ontario’s taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks — that misleadingly edited President Reagan’s 1987 radio address about trade — is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration,"" Desai said in a statement.“As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can’t be serious.”The advertisement, which cost about $ 75 million Canadian (US$54 million), used clips from Reagan’s 1987 radio address opposing tariffs. It featured workers, families, and businesses, warning that high tariffs could trigger trade wars, shrink markets and cost jobs.The ad was aired on multiple major US networks.Ford shared quotes from Reagan on social media, highlighting Reagan’s opposition to tariffs.“Canada and the US are friends, neighbours and allies, and Reagan knew that both are stronger together,” Ford said.He defended the ad as factual and intended to reach US audiences at the highest levels. “We’ve achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels,” he added.Canadian Prime Minister Carney said Canada aims to double exports to countries outside the US in response to Trump’s tariffs and remains ready to negotiate in sectors affected by trade barriers, including aluminum, steel, autos and lumber.“We can’t control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that the policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s. We have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can’t control,” he said.The ad has sparked debate across Canada. Former Conservative minister Jason Kenney defended it as an accurate replay of Reagan’s words, saying: “The Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan’s anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. It is a direct replay of his radio address, formatted for a one-minute ad.”Kenney also criticised the Reagan Foundation’s response, calling its leadership “gormless” and “easily intimidated by a call from the White House.”Premiers Wab Kinew of Manitoba and David Eby of British Columbia expressed support for Ford.Kinew said, “It’s clear that these ads are working. If you throw a rock at a lake and you don’t hear a splash, you probably missed. To my good friend Doug Ford, keep the ads on TV. They’re effective, and this country is behind you.”Trade tensions between Canada and the US have intensified in recent months, with Trump’s tariffs affecting the auto and steel industries, while Canada has imposed retaliatory levies on certain US imports.","Canada will pause anti-tariff advertisement campaign that prompted US President Donald Trump to abruptly end trade negotiations.

'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124797873.cms,"FATF Issues Warning to Pakistan on Greylist Exit, Says Islamabad Still Vulnerable To Terror Funding

Terror funding for attacks in India









The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","FATF warns Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.

Social security benefits to rise 2.8%: Retirees to see $56 monthly boost; senior citizens say increase not enough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/social-security-benefits-to-rise-2-8-retirees-to-see-56-monthly-boost-senior-citizens-say-increase-not-enough/articleshow/124792596.cms,"Social security benefits to rise 2.8% (AP)





The Social Security administration on Friday announced that its benefits will increase by 2.8% in 2026, giving retirees an average monthly boost of more than $56. The rise reflects moderating inflation after several years of higher cost-of-living adjustments (COLA).The increase will take effect in January for nearly 71 million Social Security recipients, while about 7.5 million people receiving Supplemental Security Income will see higher payments starting December 31.The announcement, which was scheduled for last week, was delayed due to the US federal government shutdown.Recipients saw a 2.5% increase in 2025 and a 3.2% rise in 2024, following a historic 8.7% jump in 2023 driven by record-high inflation. The COLA is funded by payroll taxes collected from workers and employers, up to an annual salary cap that will rise to $184,500 in 2026 from $176,100 in 2025.Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said in a statement that the annual adjustment “is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today’s economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security.” However, many seniors believe the increase won’t be enough to meet rising living costs, reported AP.Polling from AARP shows that many older Americans share that concern. Only 22% of Americans over 50 believe a COLA of around 3% is enough to keep up with inflation, while 77% disagree. According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a single adult living in Florence, South Carolina, spends about $10,184 annually on housing, $3,053 on medical expenses and $3,839 on food.Emerson Sprick, director of retirement and labor policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said in a statement that cost-of-living increases “can’t solve all the financial challenges households face or all the shortcomings of the program.”The latest adjustment comes as the Social Security Administration faces internal challenges and uncertainty about the program’s long-term future. In July, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the Republican administration was committed to protecting Social Security, hours after comments suggesting that a new children’s savings program signed by President Donald Trump was “a back door for privatising Social Security,” as quoted by AP.","Social Security benefits will increase by 2.8% in 2026, giving retirees an average monthly boost of more than $56.

Trump Tariffs, Inflation & U.S Economy: Ex-US Trade Official Issues Stark Warning I Mark Linscott

Gas prices surge, rent growth slows





Impact of tariffs on consumer prices









US inflation remained elevated in September, fueled by a surge in gas prices, even as rent growth slowed, reflecting a mixed picture for consumers in an economy with steady growth but sluggish hiring.According to the labor department report, cited by AP, consumer prices rose 3% from a year earlier—the highest increase since January and up from 2.9% in August. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, also climbed 3%, down from 3.1% the previous month.On a monthly basis, price gains eased, with overall consumer prices rising 0.3% in September, compared with 0.4% in August, and core inflation slowing to 0.2% from 0.3%.The report, delayed by the government shutdown that began October 1, leaves uncertainty over October’s inflation data, which may not be released.Gas prices surged 4.1% in September, a major driver of inflation, while grocery prices rose 0.3%, less than in August, and are up 2.7% from a year ago.Rent for apartments increased just 0.2% in September and 3.4% over the year, the smallest annual rise in nearly four years.“Put simply, while inflation doesn’t appear to be accelerating, neither is it moving back toward target,” said Eric Winograd, chief US economist at AllianceBernstein. “That will keep the Fed cautious rather than aggressive,” he added.Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump also pushed up the prices of furniture, appliances, clothing, and shoes. Economists estimate that tariffs are adding about 0.4 percentage points to annual inflation and expect the trend to continue into early next year.Ongoing tariffs continue to affect companies in specific industries. The Trump administration is considering steep duties on imports from Nicaragua, impacting businesses such as French Broad, a chocolate maker.“We’ve been shouldering some significant additional costs,” said co-founder Dan Rattigan, noting higher prices for cocoa, nuts, and chocolate-making equipment, as quoted by AP.The cost of necessities is a growing political issue. Beef prices reached record highs partly due to tariffs and drought-related reductions in cattle herds. Ground beef jumped to $6.32 a pound, and beef costs rose 1.2% in September and 14.7% over the year.Although inflation has fallen sharply from its peak of 9.1% over three years ago, it remains a major concern for consumers. About half of Americans say grocery costs are a “major” source of stress, according to an August AP-NORC poll.","US inflation remained elevated in September, fueled by a surge in gas prices, even as rent growth slowed.

The United States on Friday launched an investigation into China’s adherence to the ‘Phase One trade’ deal signed in 2020.Under the deal, China had pledged to increase purchases of US products and services by hundreds of billions of dollars over 2020 and 2021. However, the targets were not met, largely due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The probe was prompted by what the US Trade Representative’s office called China’s “apparent failure to comply with the January 15, 2020” agreement. Washington could take further action depending on the findings. This comes days before US President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping The move “underscores the Trump administration’s resolve to hold China to its Phase One Agreement commitments,” said US trade representative Jamieson Greer, as quoted by AFP.The investigation could heighten tensions between the two economies, which have already experienced a turbulent trade relationship during Trump’s second presidency. Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed sweeping duties on US trading partners, and Washington and Beijing have engaged in tit-for-tat retaliation. At one point, tariffs on both sides reached triple digits, disrupting supply chains.While tensions have eased somewhat, the trade truce remains fragile.Among the commitments, China had promised to boost purchases of US agricultural goods. But renewed tensions this year led Beijing to raise tariffs on US agricultural products, including soybeans, affecting a key support base for Trump.Chinese buyers also halted new soybean orders from the US autumn harvest, hitting the sector hard.On Friday, Greer emphasised the US commitment to protecting domestic interests. “Five years following entry into force, China's lack of compliance with the Phase One Agreement appears to have undermined the conditions of competition for US companies seeking to trade with and operate in China,” said the USTR’s office.The USTR is expected to seek public comments as part of the next steps in the investigation, which could shape Washington’s response to China’s trade practices.","U.S. launches investigation into China's adherence to 'Phase One trade' deal signed in 2020.

TL;DR: Driving the news

On October 22, the US treasury department sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil—Russia’s two largest oil companies—and 34 of their subsidiaries.

The move marked the first major economic strike by the Trump administration against Moscow during his second term, and it targets what one senior US official called “the ATM of the Russian war machine.”

The sanctions target more than 34 subsidiaries and aim to freeze Russia’s main cash pipeline fueling its war in Ukraine.

The sanctions didn’t just freeze assets or bar US firms from doing business. In a critical twist, the US warned that any bank, anywhere, facilitating purchases of oil from these firms could be cut off from America’s financial system. That secondary threat had immediate global impact.

The announcement sent global oil prices soaring by 5% and sent shockwaves through markets in China and India, the two largest buyers of Russian crude.

Chinese state-owned refiners suspended purchases. Indian refiners, including Reliance Industries, began adjusting or slashing imports.

“We waited a long time,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get.”

Still, the central question remains: will this actually move Putin?

‘Ukraine At UK’s Request…’: Putin Negotiator’s Big Reveal On ‘Breakup’ With Trump | Watch

Why it matters

Donald Trump’s sanctions strike at the very heart of the Kremlin’s wartime economy. Together, Rosneft and Lukoil produce 5 million barrels of oil a day, half of Russia’s total output, and account for over 2 million barrels in exports.

produce 5 million barrels of oil a day, half of Russia’s total output, and account for over 2 million barrels in exports. “It’s the most material move to date by the United States to shutter the Russian war ATM,” Helima Croft, of RBC Capital Markets, told CNN.

The US Treasury said the new sanctions are designed “to degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.”

And while Russia has often found creative ways around sanctions, the pressure is mounting. According to Reuters, several Chinese and Indian refiners paused purchases of Russian oil within hours of the announcement.

The big picture

“Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump said.

What they’re saying

Putin, appearing unmoved, called the sanctions “an unfriendly act” and insisted they would not inflict “significant” damage to Russia’s economy.

“No self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever make decisions under pressure,” Putin told reporters in Moscow.

Trump responded later that day with a smirk:

“I’m glad he feels that way. That’s good. I’ll let you know in six months.”

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the move but urged more.

“Sanctions are very important,” Zelenskyy said during a tense lunch with Trump. “But they are not yet enough.”

Meanwhile, Indian energy giant Reliance Industries said it would “adjust purchases” in light of the sanctions. India imports up to 2 million barrels a day from Russia-over 40% of Russia’s seaborne exports.

Still, as the Economist and CNN note, many Indian and Chinese refiners use third-party intermediaries to avoid direct exposure to US enforcement. That gives them cover-unless Trump decides to enforce secondary sanctions.

“Getting Putin to commit to serious concessions will take a lot more than sanctions,” Kurt Volker, Trump’s former Ukraine envoy, told WSJ. “Sending long-range missiles would be an important next step.”

Zoom in

Global oil prices are down 25% since January, giving him room to maneuver without triggering a domestic backlash.

New sanctions by the UK and EU-including bans on Russian LNG imports-have created a rare moment of alignment.

The Kremlin’s energy revenues have already dropped 21% this year due to drone strikes on refineries and falling global demand.

Still, enforcement remains the wild card. As CNN noted, Russia has built an “off-grid infrastructure” of shadow tankers, cutouts, and obscure banks to keep oil flowing.

Between the lines

Trump’s strategy seems torn between pressure and persuasion.

He still wants a deal. He hasn’t ruled out another meeting with Putin. But the shift in tone is unmistakable-from “art of the deal” to “enough is enough.”

A senior administration official told WSJ: “It was the culmination of good calls [with Putin] and then reading the papers and seeing Russia is still bombing schools.”

Despite Trump’s reputation for chaos, European leaders have cautiously welcomed the sanctions. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte made a surprise visit to the White House just before the announcement, urging continued US support for Ukraine.

Even Trump’s usual Republican skeptics fell in line:

Sen Marco Rubio, once a critic, said, “This was overdue.”

Sen John Thune called for a sanctions bill “to back the president’s efforts to bring the bloodshed to an end.”

What’s next

1. India cuts deeper – PM Modi may demand concessions in return.

2. China stays cautious – Beijing opposes unilateral sanctions but paused some purchases.

3. Trump enforces penalties – Will he go after buyers and shippers who defy the rules?

The bottom line





In the span of a week, US President Donald Trump went from planning a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to placing the harshest sanctions yet on Russia’s economy. The about-face was not just sudden-it was personal.The escalation follows months of Trump’s failed efforts to charm, cajole, and pressure Putin into negotiations.He offered incentives: a future summit, the prospect of post-war economic deals, and long talks with Putin. But according to WSJ, Trump’s patience snapped after yet another Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian kindergarten just days before the summit was to be held.As per the WSJ, the White House had long prepared three sanction packages-mild, moderate, and severe. Trump ultimately chose the “middle” option: hammer the oil industry but stop short of full economic warfare.Insiders say the final decision came after an Oval Office meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.“Do you guys agree with me?” Trump asked before signing off.Trump’s move represents a break from his previous reluctance to touch Russia’s oil exports-something even the Biden administration avoided to keep gas prices stable.But Trump’s calculus has changed:“The lasting impact depends on the US appetite to tackle those workarounds,” Richard Bronze of Energy Aspects told CNN.So far, the ruble has held steady, and Russian oil has not disappeared from world markets. But the friction is growing, and the logistical costs for Moscow are rising.Sanctions alone won’t bring peace. But they signal the end of the summit era and the start of a harder phase in Trump’s Ukraine strategy.If Russia’s oil exports start to fall significantly, pressure on the Kremlin will mount. But that outcome depends largely on whether:Experts agree the effect will be limited unless secondary sanctions follow.“Russia has set up a total off-grid infrastructure to be able to keep on supplying its oil to its trading partners, especially in India, especially in China,” Ajay Parmar, director of ICIS, told CNN.On the battlefield, the US has still withheld long-range missiles. But Trump hinted he’s reconsidering. If Russia escalates in response, he may reach for that option too.Trump is trying to turn economic pain into political leverage. The question is whether Putin blinks-or doubles down.This could be the start of a tougher era in US-Russia relations-or just another pivot in Trump’s unpredictable diplomacy.As Janis Kluge of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs told CNN: “Yes, it could be different tomorrow again. But it’s a signal that the mode of dealing with Russia-always giving another chance-has ended.”(With inputs from agencies)","The US treasury department sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil and 34 of their subsidiaries on October 22.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

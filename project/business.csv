"Bank holiday today: Are banks closed on November 25, 2025? Here’s what you need to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bank-holiday-today-are-banks-closed-on-november-25-2025-heres-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125555829.cms,"AI image

Are banks closed on 25th November, 2025?

Why is November 25 a holiday for schools and government offices?



With schools and several government offices in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh observing a holiday today to mark the 350th martyrdom anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur, many people are unsure whether banks are also shut.The confusion stems from the fact that November 25 has been declared a public holiday for government institutions in both states.Banks across India are operating normally today.There is no Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-notified holiday on the calendar for this date, and all scheduled bank holidays for November were already wrapped up earlier in the month.This means both private and public sector bank branches will remain open, and customers can carry out their regular banking work without any disruption.According to the RBI’s regional holiday list, services at branches nationwide will continue as usual.The day is being observed as Guru Tegh Bahadur Shaheed Diwas, honouring the ninth Sikh Guru who laid down his life to defend religious freedom during Aurangzeb’s reign.His sacrifice is remembered as a powerful symbol of courage and moral steadfastness, prompting state governments to declare a holiday for educational institutions and government staff.Hence, while schools and government offices may be shut in some states, banks are not affected and remain open today.","Banks across India are operating normally today.

Gold price prediction today: Where are gold prices headed in the coming days? Investors should watch out for these levels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-november-25-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/125554809.cms,"In the very short-term, spot gold will move as per the shifts in the December Fed rate cut probability. (AI image)



Gold price prediction :

Gold prices are likely to be influenced by the buzz around the prospect of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates in the coming reviews, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan. The analyst shares his views on gold and silver price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

On November 24, spot gold erased its losses in the Asian session to trade higher in the US session as it tracked the December Fed rate cut probability higher.

At the time of writing this article, it was changing hands at $4095, up nearly 0.70% for the day. The MCX December gold contract at Rs 123,913 was down 0.22% due to appreciation in the Indian Rupee that was triggered by RBI’s intervention and Fed rate cut hopes.

In the week ending November 21, the yellow metal, weighed down by encouraging September US nonfarm payroll report, closed 0.46% lower for the week at $4065, though it cut its losses on renewed hopes of a December rate cut sparked by New York President John Williams saying that he sees a room to cut rate in December as downside risk to the US job market has increased while upside risk to inflation has subsided.

Data roundup:

US data released on November 21 showed that composite PMI rose from 54.60 to 54.8 on better-than-expected services PMI. University of Michigan sentiment (Nov.) at 51 remains mired at record low though. One-year and five-ten-year inflation expectations eased.

UK composite PMI fell from 52.2 in October to 50.50 in November.

Eurozone composite PMI at 52.4 in November preliminary reading trailed the estimate of 52.50 on disappointing data out of Germany.

Japan's composite PMI at 52 topped the forecast of 51.50.

Earlier, the US nonfarm payroll report released on November 20 turned out to be a somewhat decent report. US added 119K jobs in September Vs the forecast 53K, though two-month net job revision stood at -33K. Private payrolls increased by 97K jobs; thus, beat the forecast of 65K jobs. However, unemployment rate ticked higher from 4.32% to 4.44%, as labour force participation rate edged higher from 62.3% to 62.4% Vs the estimate of 62.30%. Average hourly earnings were up 3.8% y-o-y Vs the forecast of 3.7%.

Fedspeak:

December Fed rate cut probability:

US Dollar and yields:

The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing this report, was steady around 100.15.

Two-year yields, which slumped 1.71% last week, edged higher by 2 bps to 3.53%, while ten-year yields, which eased 2.5% last week, were 1 bps down to 4.05%.

ETF and COMEX inventory:

As of November 21, total known global ETF holdings stood at 97.30 MOz, down nearly 0.09 MOz on the week, but continuing to hover around a 3-year high level. ETF holdings are up 17.44% YTD, though down 1.65% from the cycle high of 98.23 MOz as seen on October 21.

Eligible COMEX inventory was noted at 17.45 Moz as on November 21, down 2.22% from the cycle high of 22.45 MOz as on April 14.Fed rate cut probability:

Fed blackout period:

Geopolitics watch:

Upcoming data/events:

Major US data to be released this week include retail sales advance (September), PPI (Sept.), Conference Board Consumer confidence (November), Pending home sales (Oct.), 3Q GDP, real personal spending (October) and PCE Price Index (October) and beige book.

October and November nonfarm payroll reports will be released together on December 19; however, October unemployment rate will not be released due as household survey was not done in October.

October CPI report may not be released.

Gold Price Outlook :

In the very short-term, spot gold will move as per the shifts in the December Fed rate cut probability emerging as the major driving factor.

The metal is supported by geopolitical issues, too.

Fed Waller's comments have reduced the downside pressure.

USD-INR currency pair may swing wildly as per the risk appetite in the financial markets, which will affect domestic commodities prices.

Healthy risk appetite can limit the upside.

Overall, gold is expected to range trade between $3980 and $4160/$4200, while the interim resistance is at $4125. Strong US data may see the metal correcting lower.

Silver: seen range trading

At the time of writing this article, spot silver was hovering around $50.50, up around 1% for the day, as the metal rose on rate cut hopes. The MCX December silver contract at Rs 154,341 was up by 0.12% as stronger INR trimmed the gains.

In the week ending November 21, spot silver closed with a loss of nearly 1% at $50.02, though the grey metal cut its losses on Friday on fresh rate cut hopes.

Money managers decreased their bullish silver bets by 7,357 net-long positions to 29,893, least bullish position since August 19. Short-only positions increased by 550 lots to 12826. Long only position was at the lowest since April 22.

Silver lease rate stands at 4.19%, somewhat still elevated.

Total known global silver ETF holdings stood at 819.87 MOz, nearly the highest level since July 2202. Holdings are up around 14.52% YTD.

Silver is expected to range trade and move mostly in reaction to December Fed rate cut probability swings.

Support is at $49.30/$48.60, while resistance comes in at $51.07/$52.37.

Strong US data/impaired risk appetite can lead to a correction.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

On November 24, Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller told Fox Business that since the last Fed meeting, available data do not suggest much change, inflation not a big problem with the labour market being weak. He called for a rate cut at the December policy meeting as the job market remains weak. He added the Fed could adapt a meeting-by-meeting approach later.December Fed rate cut probability currently stands at 71%, up sharply from 24% seen on Friday before John Williams’s speech.The Federal Reserve blackout period begins from November 29 and will last until December 11during which the Fed officials will abstain from public speeches or media interviews.Escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict and tensions in the Middle East support the precious metals.European leaders’ summit on Ukraine concluded that the US 28-point peace plan needed to be worked upon further due to the plan imposing limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces. They are against changes in Ukraine’s borders by force, too.On November 26, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves will present a budget on which will be closely monitored by inventors as it is a delicate balancing act for her to balance fiscal credibility with growth.In addition, investors will also focus on European PMIs and Germany's 3Q final GDP.","Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan, shares his views on gold and silver price outlook.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Trains

PM Modi Flags Off Four Vande Bharat Express Trains From Varanasi, Says ‘New India On Fast Track’

Vande Bharat Sleeper

What are the expected features of the Vande Bharat sleeper train?

The first prototype of the Vande Bharat sleeper train has 16 passenger coaches - this includes 11 AC 3 tier coaches, 4 AC 2 tier coaches, and one AC First class coach.

The new train is capable of running at 160 kmph (testing speed 180 kmph) making it a semi-high speed train. However, most stretches on the Indian Railways network do not allow for such high train speeds.

Taking inspiration from European trains, the Vande Bharat sleeper train will have cushioned berths with enhanced comfort. The upper berth access has been redesigned for easier climbing.

The new train will have special night lights, integrated announcement systems with visual displays, CCTVs, and modular pantry units.

The train will feature modern bio-vacuum toilets, similar to those is aircrafts. There will also be a toilet for disabled passengers, which will also have a baby care station. The AC First class will include shower facilities with hot water provision.

The Vande Bharat sleeper train is equipped with the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision system. Like the chair car versions, the sleeper variant makes use of regenerative braking technology for optimal energy usage.

The coaches have automatic interconnecting doors. The gangways are sealed completely to maintain clean air and effective temperature control.

Each coach has individual reading lights, charging points, refreshment tables, and GFRP panel interiors. The train doors open automatically at the designated station.

The train has a Centralised Coach Monitoring System. Emergency communication systems connect passengers with the driver.

India is also looking to manufacture its own bullet train

Train travel in India is a vibe, with Indian Railways transporting millions of passengers. With the launch of the Vande Bharat Express trains a few years ago, Indian Railways has aimed to change the face of train travel, and several more new train projects are expected to deliver in 2026. While Vande Bharat - a chair car train set - has attempted to transform the day travel experience, there is growing demand for better and faster trains for overnight travel.In this regard, the Vande Bharat sleeper train project - launched a few years ago in the hope of rolling out an experience more premium than the Rajdhani Express trains - may prove to be a game changer. Simultaneously, Amrit Bharat Express and NaMo Bharat trains are expected to make travel more comfortable for the common man. India may also soon see its very own, indigenous bullet train Over 200 Vande Bharat sleeper trains are expected to be rolled out in the coming years as Indian Railways looks to revamp long-distance train travel. Three major projects are currently in the works: BEML is manufacturing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets with the help of ICF; Indo-Russian joint venture Kinet has been tasked with rolling out 10 train sets; and a Titagarh-BHEL consortium will make 80 Vande Bharat sleeper trains.Additionally, ICF is also looking to roll out its own version of the Vande Bharat sleeper train soon.The first prototype of the Vande Bharat sleeper train project awarded to BEML was originally supposed to be ready in the first half of 2024. Several deadlines have since then been missed. Two prototype rakes have been manufactured by BEML. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that the Vande Bharat sleeper train requires 'minor' retrofitting. He believes that they will be launched in December.Sharing details about the Vande Bharat sleeper train projects, Integral Coach Factory (ICF) GM U Subba Rao told TOI, “Initially, we have given orders for 10 trains to BEML. The first prototype came out a few months back. We wanted some upgradations and improvements in the train so the second rake has come to us with the changes.”“We have already given BEML the go ahead for the other eight trains. The Railway Board will take the call on whether the two rakes will be launched together. From here on, BEML may manufacture one train a month,” he said.ICF too is looking to manufacture its own variant of the Vande Bharat sleeper. “We are working on a 24 car rake, which will be one of the longest sleeper trains being produced in India. We are working on the designs. It is slightly different from what BEML has produced, because we are trying to increase the number of toilets since it’s a long-distance train,” U Subba Rao said.“We also plan to have a pantry car for food to be heated up and served, which is not available in the other version of Vande Bharat sleeper. So, the configuration is slightly different. We are also trying to improve upon the interiors…we are on the drawing board right now,” he added.So when does ICF plan to roll out its own version of the Vande Bharat sleeper train?“Major assemblies have been ordered. For example, the propulsion system has already been ordered, and other major assemblies like doors and brake systems, the tender is going to be floated anytime soon. Specifications have been kind of finalized. By December 2026 we are targeting that the prototype Vande Bharat sleeper rake should be ready,” he said.Meanwhile, Kinet recently unveiled the design of the First AC coach of the Vande Bharat sleeper train. The production is expected to begin at Indian Railways’ Latur factory soon.Even as it launches a premium long-distance train, Indian Railways is also looking to introduce more modern trains for the common man. Amrit Bharat trains, first launched in 2023-end will continue to be introduced in the coming years as well. ICF is already rolling out Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains with better comforts compared to the first prototypes.Amrit Bharat Express is a push-pull train with non-AC coaches with a mix of general and second-class sleeper coaches. With a faster acceleration and deceleration, thanks to its push-pull technology, the Amrit Bharat train has a maximum speed of 130 kmph. In the coming months an Amrit Bharat 3.0 train is expected to be rolled out with AC coaches as well.ICF GM U Subba Rao told TOI that there is an order for 100 Amrit Bharat trains. “We have got an order for 50 Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains and 50 more trains will be manufactured by RCF,” he said. “We have already produced 10-12 trains. Two rakes a month, we are producing right now,” he added.Talking about AC coaches for Amrit Bharat Express, he said, “We are trying to introduce the Amrit Bharat 3.0 train as well. We have been asked to make five of those trains. We are working on the designs of the AC coaches. In this financial year, maybe by March 2026, we are trying to introduce the first prototype.”“The features will be similar to Rajdhani Express trains, but also much better because we also worked on non-AC coaches and made them better than the regular non-AC coaches. It’s an ongoing, continuous process,” he added.Several other projects that Indian Railways is working on include NaMo Bharat trains for short-distance inter-city travel, India’s own indigenous bullet train, and a hydrogen train which is a technology demonstrator project. NaMo Bharat trains, already launched on some routes, are a metro-style variant of the Vande Bharat Express trains, capable of 130 kmph speed.“We have produced one NaMo Bharat train, one was produced by RCF, Both are, right now, already in service. The board has decided that RCF will produce the balance 50 trains. We have already done the designing, and the design was shared with RCF, and they also produced the same design, they will continue with the production,” said ICF GM.Indian Railways has also manufactured its, which is expected to be launched soon on the Jind and Sonipat route in Haryana under the Northern Railway. The new train will have speeds of up to 110 kmph.Talking about the hydrogen train Subba Rao told TOI, “Basically this was a technology demonstrator. We tried to demonstrate the Indian capability of producing a hydrogen train. We will run it for some time and then maybe the government of India will take a call (on whether more such trains should be manufactured).”“You know, hydrogen technology is totally new. It's at an initial stage all over the world. So we are working on it. I'm sure it'll be successful,” he said.and a project has been awarded to BEML, in collaboration with ICF for manufacturing two high-speed train sets. The train will be indigenously designed and manufactured.“High speed rail is being manufactured by BEML. We have given the order to BEML - ICF, NHRCL, and BEML are collaborating on that project. The preliminary designs are all ready. They are also finalizing the vendors for all the sub-assembles and all important components. Orders are also being placed,” Subba Rao shared.“The final designs will be done and once some components arrive the manufacturing of the prototype car body will start. By early 2027, the first train should be running,” he added.Talking about the India-specific features of the bullet train, the ICF GM said, “It will be an air-conditioned chair car train suited for Indian conditions. Tropicalization has to be done. That's why designing the train within India is very important, since we know the conditions much better. In Europe, it is very cold, so they had to concentrate more on heating systems, whereas in India it is quite hot. So we have to concentrate on the AC system. So that's one of the basic differences.”“The second difference is our country is quite dusty, so that aspect also has to be taken into account. The filters have to be much better so that the air quality inside the coach is acceptable,” he added.With Vande Bharat sleeper trains, newer versions of Amrit Bharat Express, NaMo Bharat, bullet trains, and hydrogen trains in the pipeline, passengers can hope for better travel experience in the coming years.","Vande Bharat sleeper train will have cushioned berths with enhanced comfort.

Jefferies initiated its coverage of LG Electronics India with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,900. Analysts said they view LG Electronics India as a strong play on the country’s discretionary spends, given its diversified mix. The company offers strong moats in the form of market leadership in multiple products, premium brand recall, new launches, entrenched distribution and backward integration resulting in industry-leading margins and high return ratios. They also feel the company’s cash on the balance sheet can support future growth.JP Morgan has an overweight rating on Reliance Industries with the target price upped to Rs 1,727 from Rs 1,695 earlier. Analysts said that the RIL stock is up 27% so far in the year, outperforming the 17% gain in nifty. Yet, they retain positive bias into 2026 for three key reasons: Its valuations relative to peers (DMart, Bharti Airtel) are still attractive as RIL still trades at about 15% holding company discount to these stocks, earnings drag from weak refining and petchem businesses through FY24 and FY25 is over, and forecast earnings growth should be much better.They feel that RIL’s current refining strength has potential to drive upgrades. For the company, the catalysts in 2026 are the Jio IPO, tariff increase, commissioning of new energy segments and more stable retail growth. These factors could be supportive of the stock.Citigroup has a buy rating on Max Healthcare Institute with the target price at Rs 1,460. Analysts said that their main takeaways from the management meet were these: The management expects a strong growth trajectory, supported by rising occupancy, improving case mix, and improving profitability at Dwarka and Noida. The issue about cashless facility by insurance companies is fully resolved with forward tariff corrections. The recent CGHS price revision provides a structural uplift to average revenue per occupied bed (ARPOB) and margins with full impact seen in FY27. The company also said its three major brownfield projects are commissioning in Q3FY26 with no earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) drag.Macquarie has an outperform rating on HDFC Bank with the target price at Rs 1,200. Analysts said the clear messaging from the bank was that it was seeing good growth traction post GST rate cuts. The management retained guidance for loan growth to be faster than the system in FY27. The lender is well-placed due to prudent provisioning and contingent buffers with no major impact expected from new expected credit loss norms.Motilal Oswal Securities initiated its coverage of Blue Star with the target price at Rs 1,950. Analysts said that Blue Star’s room AC (RAC) market share is rising to about 14% with the company aiming for about 15% share by FY27. They said that the near-term RAC demand is soft due to mild summer and the GST-led delays. However, they see the long-term RAC growth intact with low penetration and strong structural drivers. The company also has a strong leadership position in commercial refrigeration and robust order book in mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) and commercial AC (CAC) supports growth. Analysts also expect margin expansion via operating leverage and efficiencies, and expect unitary cooling products (UCP) revenue to dip in FY26 but rebound strongly thereafter. They also said exports were weak in the near term but expected to scale-up post FY27. And the stock’s valuation is seen as fair after the recent rerating.","JP Morgan has an overweight rating on Reliance Industries with the target price upped to Rs 1,727.

Travel high: Foreign spends at 13-month peak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/travel-high-foreign-spends-at-13-month-peak/articleshow/125577029.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Money sent overseas under RBI's liberalised remittance scheme rose to a 13-month high of nearly $2.8 billion in Sept, driven by travel spending. The outflow was nearly 1% more than the $2.76 billion recorded a year earlier and 5% above the $2.6 billion in August. Under the scheme, resident individuals can freely remit up to $250,000 in a financial year.On a (fiscal) year-to-date basis, outward remittances are down to $14.8 billion in April-Sept 2025 from $15.6 billion between April-Sept 2024Beneath the headline figures, the composition of remittances continues to shift. Travel remains the dominant category, even though spending fell 2.8% from a year earlier to $1.7 billion. Its share has climbed to 58%, up from 14% a decade ago, having crossed the 50% threshold in FY23. The trend reveals how international travel by resident individuals has become the main route of spending foreign exchange by Indians.Other categories have moved in the opposite direction. Transfers for studies abroad dropped 17.4% to $264 million, unwinding the surge seen in Aug as students prepared for the autumn term.Money sent for the maintenance of close relatives also softened. These trends reflect longer-term shifts: the share of education-related transfers, which touched 30% in FY21 when overall flows were depressed, has since slipped below 10%. Support for relatives, once nearly 30% of outward flows in FY16, now sits closer to 12-15%, even as the absolute amounts have crept higher.The most conspicuous change in Sept came from investment in equity and debt overseas. These transfers more than doubled to $279 million. Banks report a steady rise in the willingness of individuals to put money into global markets, helped by the proliferation of ETFs and the allure of tech stocks. Yet the broader story for this category is one of relative decline: its share has fallen from almost 24% in FY12 to 5-7% in recent years, constrained in part by limits on offshore exposure through mutual funds.","Money sent overseas under RBI's liberalised remittance scheme rose to a 13-month high of nearly $2.8 billion in Sept.

It's also proposing to double the upper limit for issuance of the securities without an FIR and newspaper advertisement to Rs 10 lakh.Sebi is also planning to do away with the dual requirement of getting an affidavit and an indemnity bond while applying to get duplicate securities, and is backing a single affidavit-cum-indemnity bond. Such a process has been adopted by the Investor Education & Protection Fund Authority, a body under the finance ministry that deals with unclaimed stocks, mutual funds etc for returning funds to the rightful owners.According to Sebi's proposed circular, at present, there is a three-step process for issuance of duplicate securities. The investor needs to submit a copy of the FIR including e-FIR/police complaint/court injunction order/copy of the complaint with details of the securities, folio number, distinctive number range and certificate numbers. The investor also needs to issue a newspaper advertisement about the loss of securities.Then the investor has to submit an affidavit and an indemnity bond separately on a ""non-judicial stamp paper of appropriate value"" in a Sebi-prescribed format.""However, if the value of securities as on the date of submission of application, does not exceed Rs 5 lakh,"" the first two steps are not required to be complied with, Sebi said. ""It has been gathered that due to non-standardisation of documents and different approaches followed by registrar and transfer agents (RTAs) or listed companies, investors feel the pain of going for varied documentation for various listed companies. ""Sebi received feedback from investors and other stakeholders in the system about easing some of these rules. It said that the current threshold of Rs 5 lakhs for availing simplified documentation for issuance of duplicate securities was prescribed several years ago. ""Since then, the Indian securities market has expanded significantly in terms of market capitalisation, investor participation and average portfolio size. As a result, the monetary value of individual security holdings has increased materially.""

"What do new labour codes mean for employees & employers? From minimum wages, gratuity benefits to appointment letters & layoff rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-do-new-labour-codes-mean-for-employees-employers-from-minimum-wages-gratuity-benefits-to-appointment-letters-layoff-rules-top-things-to-know/articleshow/125545231.cms,"The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensure worker safety, extend social security benefits to gig workers. (AI image)



Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

These new labour codes will replace 29 existing labour laws. These codes are:

The Code on Wages, 2019

The Code on Social Security, 2020

The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020

The Industrial Relations Code, 2020

Result of Rationalizing Labour Laws

What should employees know about the new labour codes?

There will now be separate classifications for 'employee' and 'worker', with different benefits allocated to each category.

A 'worker' means someone who belongs to the 'workman' category from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, including individuals who perform manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical, or supervisory duties.

It excludes those in 'supervisory', 'managerial', or 'administrative' positions. Whilst the earlier legislation primarily addressed industrial disputes and retrenchment, the current definition has expanded considerably.

Workers will receive specific entitlements, including overtime compensation and leave encashment, as per the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020. Regulations regarding working hours, annual leave, and standing orders apply specifically to 'workers'.

The codes bring in a unified 'wages' definition across all four sections. Earlier, multiple interpretations of 'wages' and 'salary' created difficulties in benefit calculations, which then resulted in inconsistencies and even legal disputes.

This 'wages' definition now applies to calculations for Gratuity, Employees' State Insurance, Leave Encashment, Overtime, Statutory Bonus, and other benefits. This standardisation aims to improve compliance through greater clarity.

Fixed term employees will get all benefits equal to permanent workers. This includes leave, medical, and social security. They will be eligible for gratuity after just one year, instead of the current five. Additionally, they will get equal wages as permanent staff, increasing income and protection.

To put it simply, gig workers and the unorganized sector will finally see social security benefits.

The new labour laws allow for companies that employ fewer than 300 workers to do layoffs and retrenchments without seeking prior governmental approval.

What are the key provisions of the new labour codes?

What do the new labour codes mean for employers?

Evaluate employment roles: Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work.

Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work. Assess the impact of the definition of ‘wages’ on employees’ salary structure: Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’

Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’ Analyze cost implications: Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization.

Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization. Reassess hiring models: Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment.

Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment. Align HR and Payroll policies: Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations.

Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations. Establish a robust compliance framework: Implement strong internal controls, conduct periodic diagnostic reviews, and ensure effective governance

New labour codes 2025: The government has introduced what experts are calling a significant reform in labour laws by implementing four comprehensive labour codes from November 21, 2025. The new labour codes impact both employers and employees. The new laws mean some big benefits for workers - universal minimum wages, gratuity benefits, social security coverage, provisions for women to do night shifts, recognition of gig economy workers, formal appointment letter requirement etc. However, some provisions also raise employment security issues.The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensuring worker safety, extending social security benefits to gig workers, and guaranteeing timely wage payments, while establishing minimum wage standards.At the same time, the new codes provide businesses increased operational flexibility whilst maintaining regulatory certainty, particularly important given current global economic challenges. Outdated labour laws have in the past deterred foreign investment in India's manufacturing sector, with companies often favouring countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh for their production facilities.Government officials indicated that rules for the four codes - covering wages, industrial relations, social security, and occupational safety and health - would be implemented within 45 days.Following their notification by 2020, the actual implementation had remained pending. The government has now officially announced the implementation. Whilst the final implementation rules from central and state governments are awaited, they are anticipated to be released soon.As Arvind Panagariya, Chairman of 16th Finance Commission wrote in TOI, “The importance of the four codes lies in breaking the ice. For the first time since the launch of reforms, they have removed the first set of hurdles in the way of creating high productivity jobs in large numbers.”These consolidated labour codes aim to streamline the existing laws, enhance digital compliance, improve workforce management systems, and strengthen worker protection along with facilitating business operations.EY is of the view that the implementation of the labour codes is a significant and long-awaited initiative by the government. “These codes are poised to impact nearly every function within organizations, given the extensive changes they introduce,” it says.“However, it may also result in increased costs for organizations due to wider scope of the definition of wages. There are still ambiguities regarding coverage of different components of salary within the definition of wages (such as coverage of performance bonuses / one-off payments, etc.),” notes EY in a note on the new Labour codes.The new labour laws restrict contract labour usage in organisations' 'core activities', barring specific exceptions. Core activity includes the main purpose of establishment creation and includes essential operations necessary for such activities.Additionally, fixed-term employment has received formal recognition as a legitimate employment arrangement, but it is contingent upon some conditions and regulatory requirements.The regulations also authorise states to implement adaptable work arrangements. Certain states, including Haryana and Odisha, have incorporated flexible working provisions in their draft regulations, permitting organisations to implement four-day work schedules, notes EY.EY notes that the labour codes significantly affect various aspects of HR and payroll policies. “Certain provisions overlap with existing state-specific Shops and Establishments laws, which are not superseded by the labour codes, potentially leading to conflicts, especially concerning working hours, leave, and related issues,” it says.Organizations operating in multiple states may have to ensure compliance with both sets of laws in each jurisdiction. Additionally, since specific provisions apply only to 'workers,' organizations may need to implement different policies for various employee categories, it adds.The new labour legislation also authorises both the central and state governments to create and execute welfare programmes for platform workers, gig economy participants, and unorganised sector employees.This can include life insurance, disability protection, healthcare provisions, maternity support, retirement security and any associated benefits.For gig worker social security arrangements, platform aggregators are required to contribute between 1-2% of their yearly turnover to the social security fund. This is subject to 5% of the amount paid or payable by an aggregator to gig workers, to the social security fund.This is a change from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which had set this limit at 100 workers. According to EY, the move offers businesses greater workforce management flexibility to adapt to market conditions.Additionally, the regulations also introduce a 're-skilling' fund to support any laid off workers in acquiring new skills. “For every retrenched worker, the employer is required to contribute 15 days’ last drawn wages (or any other amount notified by the central government) to a fund to be called the worker re-skilling fund,” explains EY.According to EY, It is essential for organizations to thoroughly assess the implications of these changes and prepare for a smooth transition to ensure compliance and operational efficiency. It suggests the following for organizations:The effectiveness of the new labour laws will substantially be dependent on state-level implementation, workforce education, and robust compliance monitoring.","The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensure worker safety, extend social security benefits to gig workers.

The latest reading reflects broad economic concerns across political lines and was “particularly sharp among independents,” the Board noted.The decline followed a 43-day government shutdown that delayed crucial economic data, disrupted federal paychecks and slowed business activity.

Hawkish Fed pressures prices



Stalled Clarity Act slows adoption

Institutional pullback after major liquidations

Long-term holders cash in



A $1 trillion market wipeout



Liquidity shock continues to hurt the market



Bitcoin’s steep fall over the past few weeks has raised fears of a deeper slump, with Deutsche Bank outlining five major factors behind the decline.Analysts at the bank said they are unsure whether the cryptocurrency will stabilise soon, warning that the latest downturn is different from earlier crashes dominated by retail speculation.According to Decrypt, Deutsche Bank analysts said Bitcoin has been moving in line with tech stocks as global risk appetite weakens.Concerns around the broader macro environment, Donald Trump’s unpredictable trade actions, and doubts over inflated AI valuations have dragged down risk assets generally — Bitcoin included.Bitcoin historically fares better when interest rates are low. However, the US Federal Reserve’s mixed messaging on whether it will cut rates again in December has hurt sentiment.This uncertainty has weighed on Bitcoin’s performance, reinforcing its sensitivity to monetary policy shifts.The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (Genius) Act, passed earlier this year, boosted optimism around regulation. However, the follow-up Clarity Act, which aims to define market structure rules, has hit a wall.As per Decrypt, the delay has dampened institutional confidence and slowed adoption.Institutional investors have been withdrawing following the massive $19 billion liquidation event on 10 October.As per Decrypt, Deutsche Bank analysts said that falling liquidity has made any price recovery harder.Many futures traders also exited positions, intensifying volatility.After Bitcoin crossed $126,000 last month, long-time holders took profits.Around 800,000 BTC were sold in just one month — the biggest such offload since January 2024. This added further downward pressure.Bitcoin plunged from above $126,000 in early October to below $82,200 before recovering to around $88,500.Despite the mild rebound, nearly $5 billion has exited Bitcoin-linked investment products, and the overall crypto market cap has dropped by 24% — wiping out $1 trillion.Although often compared to gold or US treasuries, Bitcoin has behaved “more like a high-growth tech stock,” according to Deutsche Bank.The bank’s analysts wrote that Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 stands at 46% this year, while its link with the S&P 500 is 42% — levels similar to the Covid-19 crisis in 2022, as per Decrypt.Gold and treasuries, meanwhile, have outperformed it.Analysts cited comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Lisa Cook, which cast doubt on expectations of a December rate cut.This uncertainty could cause further weakness, with Bitcoin’s correlation with Fed rates at -13% this year.The October crash created a liquidity vacuum that still hasn’t fully healed. Deutsche Bank, citing Kaiko data, noted that major exchanges saw order books collapse, with “ask-side liquidity effectively absent for several minutes.”This scared off market makers and deepened the price drop.The bank said the resulting negative loop between shrinking liquidity and falling prices continues to weigh on Bitcoin.",Deutsche Bank outlines five major factors behind Bitcoin's steep fall.

The European Union on Tuesday sharply criticised China’s tightening grip over rare earth exports, with the bloc’s industry chief warning that Beijing’s curbs amount to a “racket” and threaten Europe’s strategic autonomy.Addressing EU lawmakers, European Commission vice president Stephane Sejourne said the bloc must urgently accelerate efforts to cut its reliance on Chinese critical minerals.“It is high time for Europe to step up its game. To redouble its efforts to reduce our dependencies on China,” he told parliament, calling for a coordinated push to diversify supply chains.He added licences were being issued “in dribs and drabs,” resulting in delayed deliveries. He added that the process often required companies to share sensitive information. “These licences are granted in exchange for information that often - and this is worrying - include trade secrets. These requirements look like a racket if we consider all the demands made on our manufacturers to obtain licences,” he said.Sejourne is preparing a plan to end the 27-nation bloc’s reliance on China, which will be unveiled on December 3.The EU, he said, had become both a “collateral victim” of US-China trade tensions and “directly targeted” by Beijing’s policies.The upcoming package will propose speeding up joint purchasing of critical raw materials, boosting European production and recycling, and expanding partnerships with reliable suppliers. It will also include a proposal to set up a European Centre for Critical Raw Materials, modelled on Japan’s state-run Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, to act as a central hub for assessing demand, coordinating procurement and storing key minerals.China - the world’s largest producer of rare earth elements used in magnets crucial for the auto, electronics and defence sectors - introduced new export controls in October. The move rattled markets and disrupted supply chains before Beijing later said it would suspend the restrictions for one year.

Social security: Fact sheet

Social Security is a major source of income for most people over age 65.

Nearly nine out of ten people age 65 and older were receiving a Social Security benefit as of December 31, 2024.

Social Security benefits account for about 31% of the income of people over age 65.

Among beneficiaries age 65 and older, 39% of men and 44% of women receive at least half of their income from Social Security.

Among beneficiaries age 65 and older, 12% of men and 15% of women depend on Social Security for 90% or more of their income.

Why it matters

Between the lines

What they are saying

What's next

(With inputs from agencies)

For most Americans who rely on Social Security and Medicare, January 2026 will bring a financial trade-off that is less favourable than many hoped. Social Security benefits are scheduled to rise by 2.8%, an increase that, for many retirees, seemed like welcome relief in an inflationary environment. But as per a CBS News report, the standard Medicare Part B premium is climbing to $202.90 from $185-a jump of 9.7%.The Part B deductible is also rising in 2026, increasing to around $283 from $257. CBS News noted that these added costs mean a significant portion of retirees’ benefit gains will be absorbed before the funds even reach their bank accounts. What looks like a cost-of-living increase on paper may, in reality, translate into very little new disposable income.For older Americans living on fixed incomes, the interaction between Social Security adjustments and medical premium changes has real consequences. CBS News reported that the 2.8% rise in Social Security benefits is expected to add roughly $56 per month to the average monthly benefit, which now stands near $2,071. But after subtracting the extra $17.90 in Medicare premiums, the effective increase many retirees will see drops to just around $38 to $40.That leaves less margin to cope with other rising expenses-from groceries and rent to medicine and transportation. While the increase is not technically cancelled out, many beneficiaries will feel as if their higher healthcare bills “took the whole raise and then some.”Advocacy organisations stress that this is not a marginal change. CBS News quoted National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare President Max Richtman as saying that “so many rely on [Social Security] for all or most of their income. This is gonna hurt.”For beneficiaries with smaller monthly payments to begin with, the impact may be even sharper. Some individuals whose benefit increases are too small to offset the higher Medicare premiums could see no gain at all after deductions, as noted by The Economic Times.Healthcare costs are rising faster than consumer inflationAccording to analysis from KFF, the primary reason premiums and deductibles are rising is that healthcare cost inflation continues to outpace general inflation. Medicare is seeing higher utilisation, rising service prices, and expanded demand for physician and outpatient care. And because Part B premiums are designed to reflect a share of projected annual Medicare spending, higher program spending translates directly into higher charges for beneficiaries. CBS News reporting highlighted this dynamic as a core driver of the 2026 hike.Higher-income retirees face even steeper costsThe standard $202.90 premium applies only to individuals below certain income thresholds. MarketWatch noted that retirees earning above $109,000 as individuals $218,000 as a married couple, pay more through income-related monthly adjustment amounts (IRMAA). These surcharges are increasing as well, meaning the cost squeeze is even greater for upper-income retirees.Senior advocates and policy voices have been sounding the alarm for months. CBS News cited National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare expert Anne Montgomery as stating that the 2026 premium increase is “rising at a rate that’s three times that of inflation, partly due to a rise in underlying health care costs.”Her colleague Max Richtman added that because such a high share of retired Americans depend heavily on Social Security income, the premium increase would have a real financial impact: “This is gonna hurt.”From the federal standpoint, the Centres for Medicare & Medicaid Services have argued that the premium increase would actually have been larger if not for efforts to control unnecessary spending. CBS News reported that CMS pointed to cost-saving actions, including cracking down on “fraudulent use of skin substitutes,” which helped soften what otherwise would have been a more dramatic jump.Some public commentary has framed the issue as a reduction in the value of the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment rather than a direct cut. CBS News pointed out that while the COLA is officially 2.8%, factoring in the new premium leaves many retirees with something closer to a 1.9% effective increase.Retirees can expect their 2026 Social Security notification to detail both their new benefit amount and the deductions for Medicare. Beneficiaries who depend heavily on Social Security may need to reassess their budgets once the premium changes take effect.Healthcare expenses are not limited to premiums alone. Out-of-pocket costs remain a key worry, especially given that the Part B deductible will rise to about $283. Straight Arrow News noted that even those who avoid IRMAA surcharges could feel the financial tightening through deductibles and other direct expenses.Higher-income retirees should also review their tax filings, as IRMAA surcharges can significantly increase total health-care costs for those above the income thresholds.On the policy front, the widening gap between COLA adjustments and healthcare cost growth could fuel renewed debate in Washington. Some lawmakers may push to revisit how Medicare premiums are calculated or propose reforms to reduce program spending growth. But meaningful change will face political and budgetary challenges.","January 2026 will bring a financial trade-off that is less favourable than many hoped.

Shares listed in the US climbed after the company disclosed that Qwen, its new AI chatbot rivaling DeepSeek and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, crossed 10 million downloads in its first week.Chief executive Eddie Wu said the company is deepening its push into artificial intelligence and related infrastructure.“We have entered into an investment phase to build long-term strategic value in AI technologies and infrastructure,” Wu said.Cloud Intelligence Group revenue jumped 34%, hitting 39.8 billion yuan, with AI-related products recording triple-digit growth for the ninth straight quarter.Alibaba has spent around 120 billion yuan on AI and cloud infrastructure over the past four quarters, on top of its previously announced 380-billion-yuan commitment over three years.Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders fell 52% to 21 billion yuan, reflecting heavy investments and pressure from newer business lines such as instant commerce.Analysts said Qwen’s early traction underscores Alibaba’s competitive advantage in China, where ChatGPT is unavailable. China Merchants Securities analysts Crystal Li and Tommy Wong said the launch was “supported by Alibaba’s prolonged investment and cutting-edge capabilities in foundational models”.Alibaba’s US-listed shares have rallied nearly 90% over the past year, defying concerns that AI stocks may be overheating globally. The stock closed 5% higher on Monday after the Qwen milestone.Proactive Investors’ Emily Jarvie noted that Qwen’s rapid scale-up makes it “one of the fastest-growing AI apps in China”.The company has also faced renewed attention in recent weeks following a Financial Times report alleging it provides technology support and user data to Chinese authorities and the military.An Alibaba spokesperson told AFP “the assertions and innuendos in the article are completely false”.Alibaba, which runs some of China’s largest e-commerce and cloud platforms, is positioning itself as a major contender in the global AI race through deeper investment in models, chips and computational infrastructure.","Alibaba reported a stronger September quarter on Tuesday, buoyed by the blockbuster launch of its redesigned Qwen AI app. Cloud Intelligence Group revenue jumped 34%, hitting 39.8 billion yuan, with AI-related products recording triple-digit growth for the ninth straight quarter.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125563864,imgsize-730985,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Asian stocks climbed on Tuesday, buoyed by growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December, while crude prices steadied as traders balanced geopolitical uncertainty with forecasts of a softer oil market next year.As per Reuters, MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan rose 1%, led by a rebound in technology names after last week’s sharp 4% drop.The index is still on track for a 3.8% fall for the month – its first monthly decline since March. Japan’s Nikkei also gained 0.8% on reopening after a holiday, recovering from last week’s 3.5% slump.South Korea’s Kospi surged 2.39%, while the small-cap Kosdaq gained 1.7%, supported by strong moves in heavyweight chipmakers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, which were up as much as 5% and 4%, CNBC reported.Australia’s ASX 200 trimmed earlier gains but stayed slightly above the flatline. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1% and the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 1.74%, while the mainland’s CSI 300 added 0.53%.As quoted by Reuters, investment director Charlie Aitken of Regal Partners said the return of broad gains was “classic bull equity market behaviour”, noting how markets often bounce after “a short, sharp pullback”.Rate-cut hopes strengthened after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said data showed the US job market remained weak enough to justify another quarter-point cut.Markets now expect an 85% chance of a December cut, significantly higher than the 42% seen a week earlier, according to Reuters.San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly similarly supported lowering rates, telling the Wall Street Journal she saw signs of deteriorating labour conditions.Wall Street rallied overnight, with the Nasdaq jumping 2.69% in its strongest daily performance since May 2024, reported Reuters.Treasury yields were steady in Asian hours, while the dollar softened slightly. The yen, however, stayed fragile near last week’s 10-month low, with political tensions between Tokyo and Beijing over Taiwan still simmering.Bloomberg reported a further uplift in sentiment across Asian markets, with Japanese and South Korean stocks tracking Wall Street.

Trump family optimistic about crypto

Here is how Trump family’s crypto-related holdings are faring:

Trump Media sees $800 Million Valuation Loss

Trump Media Shares Have Tumbled 66% in Past Year

World Liberty Financial: $3 Billion Paper Loss

Bitcoin buying company shares struggle after 2025 peak

American Bitcoin: A decline of $330 Million

Trump Memecoin: $120 Million Loss

The recent crash in the cryptocurrency market has cost US President Donald Trump and his family several millions of dollars. During Donald Trump's second presidential term, digital assets have significantly altered his family's wealth and portfolio. But the perils and instability associated with cryptocurrency investments is now being felt by Trump and his followers.According to a Bloomberg report, the Trump-associated memecoin has seen a huge 25% decline since August. The Bitcoin mining investment held by Eric Trump has dropped by approximately 50% from its highest point. Additionally, Trump's social media enterprise, which began accumulating Bitcoin this year, is trading at near-record lows!This decline is part of a larger cryptocurrency market downturn that has eliminated more than $1 trillion in value across digital assets. The Trump family's net worth has decreased from $7.7 billion to $6.7 billion since early September, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index - this drop has mainly been due to their expanding cryptocurrency investments.Eric Trump maintains his optimistic stance on cryptocurrency. He continues to advocate for investment, particularly during market downturns.Eric Trump told Bloomberg, “What a great buying opportunity.People who buy dips and embrace volatility will be the ultimate winners. I have never been more bullish on the future of cryptocurrency and the modernization of the financial system.""Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience through numerous significant declines, consistently reaching new heights afterwards. The Trump family's cryptocurrency investments are structured advantageously. Despite owning declining crypto assets and shares, they secure income through various industry engagements.Consider their co-founded venture, World Liberty Financial: While their token holdings have decreased in value, they retain rights to revenue from token sales, independent of market prices.Georgetown University finance professor Jim Angel observes: ""Retail investors can only speculate. The Trumps can not only speculate, but they can create tokens, sell them and make money off those transactions.""Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which owns Truth Social, saw its shares plummet to their lowest point on Wednesday. The decline appears partially linked to their recent cryptocurrency investments, the Bloomberg report said.The value of Trump’s stake has decreased approximately $800 million since September. His holdings, managed through a trust under Donald Trump Jr.'s supervision, form the largest share in the company.The unprofitable company has ventured into various sectors, notably cryptocurrency. Their investment includes approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and associated securities, as stated in July.Their Bitcoin portfolio of about 11,500 coins, acquired at roughly $115,000 per coin, currently shows a 25% deficit. Additionally, they invested in CRO tokens from a Singapore-based exchange. Their CRO holdings, valued at $147 million in September, have since depreciated by approximately 50%.The company is also developing Truth Predict, a platform for sports and political wagering, through collaborative efforts with other enterprises.The WLFI token, World Liberty Financial's primary cryptocurrency offering backed by the Trump family, has seen a significant decrease, falling from 26 cents in early September to approximately 15 cents.The Trump family's WLFI token holdings, previously valued at nearly $6 billion, have decreased to about $3.15 billion.Alt5's investors experienced considerable losses, with share values declining by approximately 75% post-announcement.The Trump family's Alt5 investment through World Liberty decreased by roughly $220 million. However, they maintained profitability, receiving about 75% of World Liberty token sales proceeds, totalling $500 million from the Alt5 transaction, according to Bloomberg calculations. Additionally, they earned approximately $400 million from previous WLFI token sales.""Crypto is here to stay,"" a spokesperson for World Liberty Financial said in a statement. ""World Liberty Financial has long-term conviction in the rapidly maturing technologies underpinning digital assets, which we believe will radically improve financial services.""Approximately two months following Trump's presidential induction, his family engaged in a fresh cryptocurrency initiative. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. entered into a partnership with cryptocurrency enterprise Hut 8 Corp., establishing intricate business arrangements. Hut 8 contributed its Bitcoin mining infrastructure for a controlling interest in a newly established venture, American Bitcoin Corp.Eric Trump maintains approximately 7.5% ownership in American Bitcoin, currently listed on Nasdaq as ABTC. Donald Trump Jr. holds a lesser, unspecified portion of shares.ABTC shares reached their highest value at $9.31 in early September, valuing Eric Trump's holdings at roughly $630 million. Subsequently, the share price decreased by over 50%, resulting in a reduction of more than $300 million in family assets. This venture represents one of the most notable instances where the Trumps generated significant cryptocurrency wealth through recent business activities.Investors who acquired ABTC shares at the initial public offering experienced a 45% depreciation in value.The Trump-associated cryptocurrency has seen significant decline following its weekend launch during the presidential inauguration. Its value has diminished by approximately 25% since late August.The precise family holdings remain unclear. Analysis by Gauntlet, specialising in risk assessment, identified digital wallets linked to the cryptocurrency's creation containing nearly 17 million tokens shortly after launch. These wallets transferred an additional 17 million tokens to cryptocurrency exchanges. A subsequent 90 million tokens became available in July. Bloomberg Billionaires Index attributes 40% of the total to the Trump family, based on their World Liberty Financial ownership.At current market rates, these holdings are valued at approximately $310 million, representing a $117 million reduction since late August.The Trump family's token position has expanded substantially, according to index calculations. Certain tokens, initially restricted from trading and held by founders and insiders, are becoming available through a three-year release schedule.Following July's release event, approximately 90 million additional Trump tokens became available to insiders, with Bloomberg's wealth index attributing roughly 40% to the Trump family.These newly accessible tokens are valued at approximately $220 million, resulting in an overall increase in the family's holdings. Information regarding any token sales by the Trump family since July remains unavailable.","The Trump-associated memecoin has seen a huge 25% decline since August.

Gold outlook: Yellow metal retains shine as global uncertainty fuels record demand; HSBC sees continued strength ahead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gold-outlook-yellow-metal-retains-shine-as-global-uncertainty-fuels-record-demand-hsbc-sees-continued-strength-ahead/articleshow/125537648.cms,"Representative image

Gold is set to remain firmly supported in the months ahead, with HSBC describing the metal as a reliable shield against global volatility.In its Think Future 2026 outlook, the bank said gold continues to benefit from powerful demand both from central banks and retail investors amid persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty.As per news agency ANI, HSBC noted that gold is on track for its strongest yearly performance in almost 50 years, rallying about 54 per cent so far in 2025.The bank described this as “one of its most successful years,” driven by heightened anxiety over global stability and concerns surrounding potential US dollar debasement.Prices climbed to a historic peak of $4,380 per ounce in October before easing as retail investors booked profits. Even after retreating to around $3,885, the metal has stabilised near the $4,000 mark. HSBC said gold “appears to have resumed its upward trend,” according to ANI.A major driver of resilience has been unwavering central-bank demand. The share of gold in global central bank reserves rose from 13 per cent in 2022 to roughly 22 per cent by the second quarter of 2025.Despite prices more than doubling, HSBC said elevated levels have not discouraged institutional buyers, who are seeking protection from “geopolitical conflicts, economic and fiscal challenges, rising inflation, and significant political shifts.”Their ongoing accumulation is expected to create a strong price floor.Retail participation has also strengthened, particularly through gold ETFs, which have seen consistent inflows since mid-2024. HSBC attributed this demand to the same factors driving central-bank buying — uncertainty, inflation risks and weakening confidence in the dollar — as per ANI.While gold has recently moved in step with equity markets, HSBC stressed this is a behavioural anomaly at high price levels rather than any dilution of its safe-haven role. The metal “is still a protective asset,” the report said.Expectations of more US Federal Reserve rate cuts, following delays in economic data caused by the shutdown, add further support.HSBC said this could lift prices further, although gains may be slower than before.The bank flagged two risks: a sudden hawkish shift by the Fed and a quicker-than-anticipated rebound in global economic conditions. Still, with uncertainty lingering and the dollar outlook fragile, gold’s bias remains upward, reported ANI.","HSBC said gold continues to benefit from powerful demand both from central banks and retail investors.

Taiwan War Could Crash Global Economy As U.S. Warns Of 10% GDP Wipeout & Nuclear Risk

Bessent says inflation ‘has nothing to do with tariffs’ as U.S. rolls them back: Full interview

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has insisted the United States is not heading for a recession in 2026, expressing strong confidence that President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy and new trade agreements will bring economic relief over the next year.Speaking to NBC News’ Meet the Press, Bessent said he was “very, very optimistic on 2026” and argued that the administration had “set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy”.Bessent said the White House expects healthcare costs to fall and promised fresh announcements on that front this week.At the same time, he acknowledged that some parts of the economy are struggling, echoing earlier comments from National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett that interest-rate-sensitive sectors, especially housing, have been in recession.Bessent also pointed out that the 43-day government shutdown — the longest on record — had squeezed economic activity.A recent NBC News poll showed that nearly two-thirds of registered voters believe the administration has not delivered on the economy or cost of living.Despite this, Bessent highlighted Trump’s sweeping domestic policy package — the so-called “One Big, Beautiful Bill” — saying its various tax breaks and income-boosting measures are still kicking in and will support households next year.As per CNBC, the law introduces benefits including a larger state-and-local tax deduction, tax relief on overtime and tip income, and a senior “bonus” to offset Social Security taxes.Bessent blamed the services sector, rather than Trump’s tariffs, for ongoing inflation. He said lower energy prices should help cool inflation further, which currently sits around 3% annually.Inflation is running 0.5% higher in Democratic-led states, a gap Bessent attributed to “increased regulation”, reported Reuters.Hassett, speaking separately to Fox News, predicted that 2026 would be “an absolute blockbuster year,” although he warned of a “hiccup” in fourth-quarter data because of the shutdown.He said growth could slow to between 1.5% and 2% before picking up strongly next year.Bessent also defended the administration’s approach to the Russia-Ukraine peace push, telling NBC News that Trump is “a president of peace” and arguing that Europe's repeated sanctions packages had failed.He supported the 28-point peace proposal backed by the US, despite concerns raised by Ukraine, European governments and American lawmakers.Bessent further used the interview to urge Senate Republicans to end the filibuster if Democrats trigger another government shutdown, calling the recent closure a “1.5% hit to GDP”.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has insisted the United States is not heading for a recession in 2026.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

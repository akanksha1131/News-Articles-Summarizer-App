‘False’ FASTag wallet toll deduction? Here’s what NHAI is doing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/false-fastag-wallet-toll-deduction-heres-what-nhai-is-doing/articleshow/118677800.cms,"FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home.

‘False FASTag toll deduction ’: The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has taken strict action against incorrect FASTag wallet deductions, penalising toll collectors in approximately 250 instances.FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas. Officials attribute this to toll operators' errors in vehicle number entry, particularly when FASTag becomes unreadable, or when individuals carry tags in their wallets.IHMCL , the highways authority's toll management body, now levies a Rs 1 lakh fine per violation in such cases. According to a TOI report , this substantial penalty has resulted in a 70% reduction in such incidents.Currently, IHMCL receives about 50 legitimate complaints monthly, compared to 30 crore FASTag transactions across national highway toll plazas.Users have reported false toll deductions on social media platforms and through formal complaints to IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately. Additionally, a Rs 1 lakh penalty is imposed on the toll operator responsible,"" said a senior IHMCL official.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter! India now shipping Apple product components to China & Vietnam The official explained that incorrect vehicle number entry by toll operators during manual electronic transaction processing remains the primary cause of these false deductions.A FASTag serves as a rechargeable, prepaid tag that enables vehicles to navigate through toll gates without stopping, utilising RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. The system facilitates automatic toll fee deductions from a connected prepaid account, which users can control via FASTag applications. This electronic tag, attached to the vehicle's windscreen, establishes communication with toll plaza scanning equipment.NHAI implemented FASTag, making it compulsory for all vehicles. This electronic toll collection system has transformed toll payments across India by significantly reducing queue times, decreasing fuel usage, and minimising person-to-person contact at toll booths.","FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas.

BSE Small Cap Stocks

BSE Small Cap Stocks

BSE Small Cap Stocks

Stock market crash : Smallcap and midcap stocks have experienced their most severe decline since the March 2020 Covid market downturn, causing significant losses for retail investors. In February, widespread selling affected the broader market severely, with the BSE Smallcap index declining 14%—marking its first double-digit monthly reduction since the pandemic—whilst the Nifty Midcap 100 fell 10.8%.According to an ET analysis, within the BSE Smallcap index comprising 938 stocks, 321 companies saw declines exceeding 20% in a single month. Notable casualties included Vakrangee, Zen Technologies, Oriental Rail Infra, and Suratwwala Business Group, which fell between 40% and 66%. The situation appears particularly severe, with 243 smallcap companies now trading at less than half their 52-week peak values.The Nifty Midcap 100 descended to its lowest point since March 27, 2024, whilst the Nifty Smallcap 100 dropped 3% to reach its lowest close since March 19, 2024, the ET report said. Investors' confidence continues to deteriorate amidst persistent selling, unfavourable global indicators, political uncertainty, and concerns about liquidity in smaller capitalisation stocks.Pratik Gupta of Kotak Institutional Equities maintains a cautious stance regarding small and midcap valuations. ""We remain cautious on the outlook for small/mid-caps in general due to expensive valuations in many cases. We have been negative for a while, and despite the correction, we do not believe the valuations have come down enough.""Also Read | Stock market crash: Sensex, Nifty are bleeding! Why it may be time to put your money in gold, silver, FDs, bonds & other investment avenues Gupta identified several key concerns, including potential severe global economic deceleration, reduced agricultural income due to poor monsoons affecting construction, and decreased domestic retail investment in equities. ""Most local MF, insurance, and PMS funds are seeing a slowdown in their equity inflows, but overall net inflows continue. The nature of flows has, however, shifted from small/midcaps or thematic/sectoral funds to large-cap or balanced debt-equity funds,"" he observed.Sudeep Shah, Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical & Derivatives Research at SBI Securities, noted significant technical deterioration in both indices. ""The Nifty Midcap 100 has slipped below its 100-week EMA for the first time since August 2020, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 has been trading below its 100-week EMA for the last three weeks. The 14-week RSI is in bearish territory and falling, which is a negative sign.""He outlined important price points for observation. ""For the Nifty Midcap 100, the 47,200-47,000 zone will act as immediate support, while a further slide below 47,000 could open doors to 46,400. On the upside, 48,800-48,900 will be a key hurdle. Meanwhile, for the Nifty Smallcap 100, support is placed at 14,200-14,100, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of its prior rally from 8,682 to 19,716. Resistance is at 15,100-15,200.""Also Read | 'More of white noise': Why Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India’s exports to US will have a ‘limited’ impact Rajkumar Singhal, CEO of Quest Investment Advisors, observed that disappointing earnings have significantly affected small and midcap sectors. ""Smallcap valuations remain above long-term averages, and earnings downgrades have exacerbated the sell-off. With earnings likely to recover in CY25, the pain in small and midcaps may ease, but a selective, bottom-up approach is key—focus on quality businesses with strong balance sheets and sustainable growth.""Market analysts provide differing perspectives on current market conditions. Dharmesh Shah from ICICI Direct draws confidence from past market behaviour. ""Over the past two decades, midcaps and smallcaps have corrected by 25-30% during bull markets before seeing a strong rebound,"" he noted, whilst acknowledging the possibility of further decline whilst suggesting current levels may indicate approaching market bottom.According to Shah's analysis, present market valuations present opportunities in quality midcap and smallcap shares, with potential upside movement anticipated within the next quarter.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Offering an alternative perspective, market specialist Nischal Maheshwari advocates for a selective approach towards mid and smallcap investments. ""We should stick to sectors where we find comfort in valuations. If mid and smallcaps have corrected enough and you feel comfortable with the valuation, you can look at them selectively.""Given the current international uncertainties, pre-election market volatility, and deteriorating technical indicators, investors must decide between immediate market participation or maintaining a cautious stance. The forthcoming period will prove decisive in establishing whether the current market decline stabilises or continues further downward.","Smallcap and midcap stocks have experienced their most severe decline since the March 2020 Covid market downturn.

Manufacturing activity slows to a 14-month low in February: Survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/manufacturing-activity-slows-to-a-14-month-low-in-february-survey/articleshow/118693692.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Activity in the country's manufacturing sector grew at its slowest pace in 14 months as production and new orders moderated but it still remained robust, a survey showed on Monday.The HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered a reading of 56.3 in Feb, down from 57.7 in Jan, but still indicative of further improvement in the health of the sector. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction in the survey, which is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to 400 manufacturing firms.The Feb data showed a forty-fourth consecutive rise in new business intakes , which panel members linked to strong client demand and efforts to price better than their competitors. The overall pace of growth receded to the slowest since Dec last year, but was above its long-run average.""Although output growth slowed to the weakest level since Dec 2023, overall momentum in India's manufacturing sector remained broadly positive in Feb,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. New export orders rose strongly in Feb as manufacturers continued to capitalise on robust global demand for their goods. Although softer than Jan's near 14-year high, the pace of expansion was sharp, the survey results showed.In response to the upturn in new orders, manufacturers continued to expand their workforce numbers in Feb, extending the period of employment growth to a year. The rate of job-creation was the second-best in the series history, behind only that recorded in January.","The HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered a reading of 56.3 in Feb.

MUMBAI: Boring may be better for most Dalal Street investors. While the sensex is down over 6% this year, the BSE midcap index has slid 17% and smallcap has plunged over 22%.Market players say that pain for mid and small-cap investors is not likely to ease soon - due to earnings downgrades and overvaluation concerns. At the same time, some institutional investors are beginning to see some value in large-cap stocks. However, any upside will be limited until the relentless selling by foreign funds eases.To be sure, over a five-year period, the BSE midcap index is up 172%, while the smallcap one has rallied 220%, as against the sensex's 95% gain. The sharp drawdown in small and mid-cap stocks isn't particularly surprising as these scrips are typically more volatile than blue chips. Financial advisers say that small and mid-cap stocks should only be considered by long-term investors. ""Domestic investors remain worried about the risk of further earnings downgrades given the weak commentary by many companies,"" Pratik Gupta, CEO & co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities, said.Analysts see the slowdown continuing to impact corporate earnings through the current quarter and the June quarter. Institutional investors - foreign and domestic - say there is scope for small and mid-cap stocks to fall further. ""Even after the recent correction, we do not believe mid & small-cap valuations have come down enough,"" Gupta said.While NSE data shows that foreign funds ownership in Indian stocks has dropped to a 13-year low of 17.4% as of Dec, these investors continue to hold an oversized influence on the D-Street. Analysts expect the foreign fund selling to slow in March as large-cap valuations look 'less expensive'.""Foreign funds are unlikely to sell as aggressively as in the last few months. Long-term investors can utilise the weakness in the market to slowly accumulate fairly valued quality large-caps,"" V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said in a note.","The sensex is down over 6% this year, the BSE midcap index has slid 17% and smallcap has plunged over 22%.

What’s next

US stocks fell sharply on Monday, wiping out much of their gains since President Donald Trump ’s election, after he announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would take effect within hours.The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% following Trump's statement that there was ""no room left"" for negotiations to lower the tariffs, which will begin Tuesday. The move dashed Wall Street 's hopes for a softer trade policy.Monday’s losses cut the S&P 500’s post-Election Day gains to just over 1%, down from a peak of more than 6%. The market had rallied on hopes that Trump’s policies would strengthen the economy, but recent trade tensions and economic data have raised fears of a slowdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 649 points, or 1.5%, while the Nasdaq composite slumped 2.6%.The market decline came amid broader concerns about US economic growth. A report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed that manufacturing activity remained in expansion but at a slower pace than economists expected. More concerningly, manufacturers saw a contraction in new orders, while prices rose amid discussions over who will bear the cost of Trump’s tariffs.Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM’s manufacturing survey committee, noted, “Demand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists’ companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration’s tariff policy.”Wall Street had anticipated that Trump might use the tariffs as leverage for negotiations rather than enforcing them. However, the decision to proceed unsettled investors already wary of economic uncertainties.“Markets were looking for another 11th-hour deal to further delay tariffs, but aren’t going to get one this time,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “The next phase is to endure them. Markets have to price that reality, and those numbers are painted red.”James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, echoed the concerns: “It’s just more of a continuation of a string of bad economic news that tends to put a little bit of a dampener on the optimism we saw from fourth-quarter earnings.”Certain sectors and stocks were hit particularly hard. Nvidia fell 8.8%, and Tesla slipped 2.8%. Retail giant Kroger dropped 3% after its Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an internal investigation into his personal conduct.Even stocks connected to cryptocurrency took a hit. MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, slid 1.8%, while Coinbase dropped 4.6% despite Trump’s weekend announcement that his administration was moving forward with a crypto strategic reserve.The effects of Trump’s trade policies are being felt worldwide. In China, manufacturers reported an increase in orders in February as buyers rushed to secure goods ahead of higher US tariffs. Trump’s 10% tariff on Chinese imports is set to rise to 20% on Tuesday, and the administration has also ended the “de minimis” loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs.European markets, in contrast, performed better. Germany’s DAX surged 2.6%, and France’s CAC 40 rose 1.1% following a report that showed inflation was easing in February. This bolstered expectations that the European Central Bank may cut interest rates later this week. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, bubble tea chain Mixue Bingcheng soared 43% in its market debut, boosting the Hang Seng index by 0.3%.Investors will be closely watching upcoming economic reports and Federal Reserve signals. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.16% from 4.24% before the manufacturing report’s release, reflecting concerns about a slowing economy. Typically, falling Treasury yields can boost stocks, but this time the decline is driven by fears of a broader economic downturn.With inflation worries still present, the Federal Reserve may have limited room to cut interest rates to stimulate growth. Market expectations currently point to at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of the year, but economic conditions could force a reassessment of that outlook.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% following Trump's statement that there was ""no room left"" for negotiations to lower the tariffs, which will begin Tuesday.

MUMBAI: Former Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch , Bombay Stock Exchange MD Sundararaman Ramamurthy, and others approached Bombay HC Monday for quashing a special court order that directed Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to register an FIR against them in an alleged 1994 ""irregular"" listing of a company on the stock exchange and ""oversight failure"".Terming the order ""unjust"" and ""harsh"", the officials said none of them held the positions in 1994 and the court ought to have seen that ""no vicarious liability can be fastened"" on them.Justice S G Dige posted the petitions for hearing on Tuesday and orally asked ACB not to take any action on the trial court order till then.Senior counsel Amit Desai appearing for BSE managing director Sundaraman Ramamurthy and another stock exchange official said it was ""shocking"" to see FIR was ordered on a ""four-line complaint"" filed in 2024 for a 2009 investment in a company listed in 1994.Since the FIR is not yet registered, Desai requested HC to ask police to hold its hand till it hears the matter, which the court orally did.Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta appearing for whole time members at Sebi -- Ashwani Bhatia, Ananth Narayan G and Kamlesh Chandra Varshney-- and senior advocate Sudeep Pasbola appearing for Buch (60) adopted Desai's stance when the matter was mentioned before Justice Dige.The petitioners said the trial court erred in law by ignoring the requirement of prior sanction from the central govt under the Prevention of Corruption Act before ordering a probe against public servants and failed to give reasons for dispensing with such requirement. Besides, no notice was given to the officials before passing the order, they said.The Sebi officials stated that the trial court order is ""manifestly erroneous, patently illegal and without jurisdiction"".Bhatia was appointed in June 2022, Narayan in Oct 2022, and Varshney in Sept 2023 for three years. All three said the trial judge ignored the law that ""specific"" allegations indicating any complicity is needed to involve them.The complaint was filed by a Dombivli resident, Sapan Shrivastava, on April 6, 2024, against the six offficials. Shrivastava's complaint said he and his family invested in Cal Refineries Ltd, listed ""allegedly without requisite compliance"" on BSE on Dec 13, 1994. He alleged that the ""fraudulent listing of Cal, which was against the rules, resulted in a huge loss to him"" and alleged the public servants took ""illegal gratification and various other benefits"" and ""failed to protect the interest of investors.""The Sebi officials said the complaint was filed only when the complainant's investment ""lost value"" and ""just to settle his grievances against the company"".Special ACB court Judge S E Bangar, in the March 1 order, said, ""There is prima facie evidence of regulatory lapses and collusion, requiring a fair and impartial probe"". The trial court said it would monitor the probe and directed ACB to submit its report in 30 days.The petitioners told HC the trial court erred in appreciating that no case was made out of any irregularities against them for the listing or even for alleged failure in their duties as Sebi officers.Bhatia's plea also said the special court ought to have seen that Sebi informed Shrivastava that information regarding compliance or NOC was not available with them and thus it ""doesn't establish that CAL had not met with requisite compliances"".","Former Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, Bombay Stock Exchange MD Sundararaman Ramamurthy, and others approached Bombay HC Monday for quashing a special court order.

NEW DELHI: Gold will remain relevant for investors as a portfolio diversification mechanism with a likely ascending importance as an asset class in the coming years, CEA V Anantha Nageswaran said on Monday.He said that gold will remain relevant not only as a store of value, as an ornament for cultural and religious purposes, but also as an important portfolio diversification mechanism ""until such a time the world is able to arrive at an international monetary system from the current international monetary non-system"". He was speaking at the IGPC-IIMA annual gold and gold markets conference 2025.The value of gold has increased by over $200 per ounce or 8% in the last three months to $2,860 per ounce. Since 2002, the value of the precious metal is up 10 times when it was about $250-290/ounce. In the Indian market, the price of gold per 10gm stood at around Rs 85,000. India is a net importer of gold.He said it is very important to remember the relevance and the importance of gold for a portfolio, a store of value, etc, more so in the backdrop of the likely ascending importance of gold in the coming years. Nageswaran also hoped that India will find ways to productively deploy the gold assets that it has without diluting its role as a symbol of store of value as well as cultural and religious significance. ""That is where the policy challenge lies,"" he said.""So given that the fear of inflation is still there and the world is witnessing the after effects and the consequences of policy discretion that commenced in 1973, gold's importance will continue to remain very salient and high,"" Nageswaran said.","The value of gold has increased by over $200 per ounce or 8% in the last three months to $2,860 per ounce.

Who was Manav Sharma?

Showed interest in living with boyfriend: Manav's Dad

AGRA: In a case similar to Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash's suicide, a 30-year-old man who worked as a manager with TCS in Mumbai, Manav Sharma, ended his life in Agra after alleged harassment by his wife, Nikita Sharma (28). Before hanging himself on February 24, he recorded a 6-minute and 57-second video expressing distress over his marriage.In the video, Manav apologises to his parents and pleads for awareness of men's struggles, stating, ""Please, someone should talk about men. They become very lonely.""Manav, a resident of Defense Colony, worked in Mumbai. His father, retired Air Force officer Narendra Sharma, reported that Manav married on January 30, 2024.After an initially peaceful period, conflicts arose when his wife allegedly threatened false accusations and expressed interest in living with her boyfriend.On February 23, Manav and his wife returned from Mumbai. Later, when he dropped her at her maternal home, he was reportedly threatened by her family. The next morning, he took his own life.Despite the emotional video, police initially received no complaint. However, after a WhatsApp complaint from the family on Thursday night, police officials confirmed that a case is being registered and an investigation is ongoing.Sharma’s wife, Nikita Sharma, rejected all the accusations and alleged that her husband had been struggling with alcohol addiction and had self-harmed several times before.“He used to drink excessively and had attempted suicide multiple times. I saved him many times. He also assaulted me after drinking. I had informed my in-laws several times, but they ignored my pleas, saying that it was a matter between a husband and a wife and they cannot do much in it,” Nikita said.""On that day, I reached out to my in-laws and Manav's parents that he may take the extreme step. His sister was also informed about it by me. People also need to listen to my side of the story,"" Nikita added.According to his LinkedIn profile, Manav was a Senior Process Associate at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and had previously worked as a Talent Acquisition Specialist at various organizations. He was a graduate of DAV College, Chandigarh.Before taking the drastic step, Sharma recorded a one-minute, 57-second video, which was later discovered by his family.In the emotional clip, he was seen crying and urging society to acknowledge the challenges faced by men. He repeatedly appealed for people to ""think and talk about men"" while apologising to his parents for his irreversible decision.DCP (Agra city), Suraj Rai, said, ""The man died by suicide on Feb 24.

We're probing the matter from all possible angles, and further action will be taken based on evidence.""Both Sharma and his wife, who works in a leading IT firm, were living in Mumbai. They got married on Jan 30, 2024.

VIJAYAWADA: The AP govt placed IPS officer PV Sunil Kumar under suspension for allegedly undertaking multiple foreign trips without obtaining prior permission.The govt order issued on Sunday cited repeated violations of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968. According to the official order, Sunil Kumar, a 1993-batch officer (waiting for posting), undertook multiple foreign trips without proper authorisation. In some instances, he reportedly deviated from approved travel plans.The govt highlighted several instances of misconduct in the order. During March 2024, he was granted permission to visit Georgia but travelled to the UAE instead. In Sept 2023, he visited Sweden without govt approval. In Feb 2023, he travelled to the US without prior permission. In Dec 2022, he was allowed to visit Georgia but travelled to the UAE. In Oct 2021, he visited the UAE without clearance.In Dec 2019, he was permitted to travel to the US but instead went to the UK.

Further, officials pointed out that such violations reflect indiscipline and disregard for administrative accountability. Given the seriousness of the matter, the govt decided to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Sunil Kumar for gross misconduct and negligence.

‘An act of war’: Warren Buffett on Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/an-act-of-war-warren-buffett-on-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118695693.cms,"Market reaction and economic concerns

Trump’s justification

Buffett’s market moves and long-term outlook

President Donald Trump ’s latest round of tariffs on major US trading partners has sparked concerns about inflation and economic disruption , with legendary investor Warren Buffett weighing in on the potential fallout.In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Buffett called tariffs “an act of war, to some degree,” drawing from decades of experience in the global economy. The billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway warned that tariffs function as a tax on goods, ultimately leading to higher prices for consumers.“The Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ‘em!” Buffett quipped during the interview, emphasizing that the financial burden of tariffs will fall on consumers.Buffett’s remarks come as Trump moves forward with imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, effective Tuesday. The administration has also announced an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%, a move that is likely to escalate tensions with Beijing. In response, China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs, raising concerns of a renewed trade war .Economists widely agree that tariffs disrupt international trade and lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers. The Trump administration has presented tariffs as a tool to pressure foreign governments and boost domestic manufacturing, but critics warn that such policies could backfire, especially given the deeply integrated supply chains across North America.Trump’s tariff announcement sent financial markets into turmoil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 649 points (1.48%), while the S&P 500 dropped 1.76% and the Nasdaq fell 2.64%. Automaker stocks took a significant hit, with General Motors declining 4% and Ford down 1.7% due to their manufacturing dependencies in Mexico.The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also declined in response to the news, while officials in both countries signaled that they were preparing countermeasures. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly criticized Trump’s move, calling it “unpredictable and chaotic.”Trump defended the tariffs at a White House event, arguing that they would encourage companies to move production to the U.S. “They’re going to have to have a tariff. So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,” he said.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick dismissed Buffett’s concerns, calling them “silly” in an interview on CNN’s The Situation Room. Lutnick went further, suggesting that tariffs could replace the need for the Internal Revenue Service, falsely claiming that the IRS was created when the US entered World War I. In reality, the IRS was established in 1862 during the Civil War, and the modern federal income tax was introduced in 1913.Despite the administration’s claims, experts argue that shifting government revenue away from income taxes to tariffs would be impractical, given the complexity and scale of the modern US economy.Buffett has historically been critical of tariffs, calling Trump’s past trade policies “a very bad idea.” His recent actions in the financial markets suggest caution about the economic outlook. Over the past year, Berkshire Hathaway has significantly increased its cash reserves, reaching a record $334.2 billion in the fourth quarter while selling off shares of major companies like Apple and Bank of America.Although Buffett refrained from directly commenting on the economy in his CBS interview, he described it as “the most interesting subject in the world.”Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has reached record highs, with both Class A and Class B shares surging. However, Buffett’s conservative investment approach has raised speculation that he is preparing for economic uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","Warren Buffett calls tariffs “an act of war, to some degree,” drawing from decades of experience in the global economy.

The US treasury department announced Sunday that it will no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its associated Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements.The decision effectively suspends penalties for US citizens and domestic companies, shifting enforcement efforts toward foreign businesses.The move was welcomed by US President Donald Trump. He celebrated the decision on Truth Social, calling the BOI rule ""outrageous and invasive.""He wrote, ""Exciting news! The treasury department has announced that they are suspending all enforcement of the outrageous and invasive Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirement for US citizens. This Biden rule has been an absolute disaster for small businesses nationwide. Furthermore, treasury is now finalising an emergency regulation to formally suspend this rule for American businesses. The economic menace of BOI reporting will soon be no more.""The BOI rule, introduced under the CTA, required businesses to disclose details about their owners to the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network (FinCEN) to curb money laundering and financial crimes.However, according to Irish Star, the enforcement of these requirements had already faced multiple delays due to legal challenges.As per Fox Business, treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported Trump’s stance, calling the decision ""a victory for common sense.""He added, ""Today’s action is part of President Trump’s bold agenda to unleash American prosperity by reining in burdensome regulations, in particular for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.""The treasury department also confirmed on X that “penalties or fines associated with BOI will not be enforced,” and clarified that the agency will issue a new proposed rule to limit the reporting requirement to foreign companies only.The CTA, which was signed into law in January 2021, was initially set to take effect in January 2024 but repeated federal court rulings delayed its implementation. The law aimed to increase financial transparency by making it harder for criminals to use shell companies for illicit activities such as money laundering and drug trafficking.Trump’s latest policy shift aligns with his broader economic agenda, which includes regulatory rollbacks and spending cuts ranging from $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion, according to Fox Business.","The US treasury department announced Sunday that it will no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its associated Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements.

Trump's crypto play: A game changer or just a market jolt?

Unanswered questions: How will the crypto reserve work?

US President Donald Trump shook up the cryptocurrency world on Sunday, announcing that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve . The move sent all three assets surging between 10% and 35% in market trading, reported Reuters.Trump revealed the decision in a social media post, tying it to his January executive order on digital assets. “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World,” he declared, adding that his directive instructed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the reserve plan.The announcement marks a sharp policy shift from the Biden administration, which had cracked down on the crypto industry over concerns about fraud and money laundering. Trump's 2024 campaign, in contrast, won significant backing from crypto executives, and his latest move signals that he intends to deliver on his pro-crypto promises.While the news initially sparked a rally, broader cryptocurrency markets have struggled in recent weeks, with many digital assets erasing their post-election gains. Analysts believe a more sustained market boost will require either interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve or a clearer regulatory framework from the Trump administration.Despite the excitement, details about the crypto reserve remain unclear. Some experts speculate it could be funded through the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is traditionally used to manage foreign currencies. Others suggest it might involve cryptocurrencies seized in law enforcement actions.Legal scholars are divided on whether the reserve could be established without congressional approval. Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is pressing ahead—his family has even launched its own cryptocurrency, and the first-ever White House Crypto Summit is set for Friday.With the administration doubling down on its pro-crypto stance, all eyes are now on Washington to see whether Trump’s bold move is the start of a new financial era or just another short-lived market shake-up.","US President Donald Trump announced Sunday that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve.

"Tesla sets sights on Waymo, Uber in California ride-hail bid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-sets-sights-on-waymo-uber-in-california-ride-hail-bid/articleshow/118656189.cms,"Tesla

Different business models

Tesla Inc. is seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, a key step by Elon Musk’s company to begin carrying paying customers while its traditional car-selling business falters.The electric vehicle manufacturer applied late last year for what’s known as a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, according to documents viewed by Bloomberg. That classification means Tesla would own and control the fleet of vehicles.The previously unreported application suggests Tesla is working to launch a promised ride-hailing business in the near term, opening a new revenue stream and putting it in competition with the likes of Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc. and Waymo. Musk has said Tesla would roll out driverless ride-hailing in Austin in June and aimed to offer it in California by the end of the year, without offering specific details.Shares of Uber briefly turned negative on the news and were trading up less than 1% as of 12.57 p.m. in New York. Lyft also pared gains. Tesla was little changed.Musk has made a big bet on autonomous driving , robotics and artificial intelligence as the primary business of selling EVs struggles. Tesla recently posted its first annual sales decline in over a decade, and the first quarter shows signs of sluggishness in key markets such as the US and Europe.In its communications with California officials, Tesla discussed driver’s license information and drug-testing coordination, suggesting the company intends to use human drivers, at least initially. Tesla is applying for the same type of permit used by Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s robotaxi business. While Tesla has approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California, it doesn’t have, nor has applied for, a driverless testing or deployment permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, according to a spokesperson.It wasn’t immediately clear whether Tesla would obtain the California Public Utilities Commission permit or when the service might start. A spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Tesla’s application “is pending and not yet public.”Casey Blaine, Tesla’s senior regulatory counsel, didn’t respond to requests from Bloomberg for comment. Several other Tesla employees who are involved in the effort also didn’t respond to inquiries.A ride-hailing business with human drivers could pave the way for Tesla to introduce robotaxi service in California, where Waymo already operates a driverless fleet in San Francisco.There are different permitting requirements and operating rules for each business model — Uber and Lyft allow drivers to use their personal vehicles, unlike Waymo — and the state’s stricter demands on autonomous vehicles have tripped up some companies. Cruise had its license suspended in California after an incident that injured a pedestrian, and parent General Motors Co. later folded the operations while abandoning the robotaxi market.Musk has talked for years about operating a Tesla fleet without human drivers. Tesla does not currently have a fully autonomous vehicle on the market, but it offers driver-assistance systems that control some functions while an alert human remains behind the wheel.Tesla unveiled a prototype in October of its forthcoming driverless Cybercab. Musk has said the company will roll out its ride-hailing service initially using existing vehicle models, which would include the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV.Musk recently addressed ride-hailing preparations, saying that there was “a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works efficiently,” including ensuring that the payment system and app functionality operate as intended.Tesla’s path to launching robotaxi service is clearer in Texas, where autonomous driving is regulated much like any other vehicle. Its vehicles will be required to have cameras and be able to follow traffic laws and have insurance.The company will also need a ride-share license with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. As of early February, the company had not had communication with the department, according to a records request.

Bitcoin slides from all-time high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-slides-from-all-time-high/articleshow/118655668.cms,"Trump trade woes

A week-long rout in Bitcoin deepened amid the recent broader retreat from risky assets in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and crypto sector turmoil, marking a dramatic reality check for one of the most popular Trump trades.The original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday, bringing its decline from the all-time high reached less than six weeks ago to 28%. Bitcoin later pared the loss, and ended up trading little changed on the day. Bitcoin fell around 18% in February, the biggest monthly drop since June 2022.“Some large players just said at the end of the day, ‘you know what, I’m just going to throw in the towel,” said Zaheer Ebtikar, co-founder of crypto fund Split Capital. “I think that’s what we saw this past week. There was definitely a lot of selling more than usual, so it’s hard to pinpoint one specific exchange or place.”This week’s drop in Bitcoin has taken it to technical levels that many traders watch for signs that the selloff may have gone too far, inspiring dip buyers to step in and at least pause the declines. Bitcoin has fallen below its 200-day moving average, a closely watched indicator of the long-term trend, for the first time since October. Its 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of price momentum, this week fell below a level indicating the asset is considered oversold for the first time since September.Trump said Thursday that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would come into force from March 4, undermining hopes he might reverse course after a previous delay. He also said Chinese imports would face a further 10% levy, prompting officials in Beijing to promise “all necessary measures” in response.The focus on trade tensions had led to a broad risk-off decline across markets on Friday, pushing down almost all Asian stock markets and fueling declines in Europe. But cryptocurrencies — which are deeply exposed to shifts in risk appetite — were among the worst hit.The selloff underscores a swift change of fortunes for what was previously one of the most popular Trump trades in global markets: buying Bitcoin on the expectation that the president’s crypto-friendly approach would lead to a broad rally.That worked for a while. Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $109,241 on Jan. 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. But cryptocurrencies have recently come under pressure amid worries that Trump’s pugilistic approach to global trade could lead to broad pain.“Given the macro environment, it’s not surprising to see we are where we are,” said Stefan von Haenisch, director of over-the-counter trading in Asia Pacific at crypto custody firm Bitgo Inc. Traders are still waiting for Trump to come up with concrete steps for the sector including a Bitcoin stockpile, he said.Investors are now being forced to consider quite how far the world’s biggest cryptocurrency can fall. There is support for the coin around $70,000, said Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler, pointing to technical analysis. But he said investors shouldn’t assume the rout in Bitcoin will get that bad.“We will only see this level if negative sentiment dominates the equity markets,“ said Lienkha.Bearish sentiment has also hit spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds . Investors have pulled a record $3.3 billion from US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in February, poised for the biggest monthly exodus since they debuted, as investors sought refuge in safer assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and persistent inflation concerns.Trump has already made a few changes that have pleased crypto bulls, including putting crypto advocates in key positions. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which embarked on a yearslong crackdown under former Chair Gary Gensler, has also closed investigations into several crypto outfits in recent weeks.Trump has said he wants to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.”","The original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday.

Many analysts believe these factors are pushing investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.After a strong run in the markets, sentiment took a hit this week when Trump confirmed that a 25 per cent tariff on Mexico and Canada would take effect on 4 March, with an additional 10 per cent levy on China to follow.Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $109,241 on 20 January, the day of Trump’s inauguration, but has since plunged almost 25 per cent as traders unwind bets placed on the back of his election.The sell-off gained momentum during Friday’s Asian trading session, driven by growing concerns over Trump’s aggressive trade policies and broader economic instability. His pledges to slash taxes and immigration also raised fears of renewed inflation, which could compel the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated.","The world’s largest digital asset dropped to $79,525.88 during early Asian trading on Friday.

Adding to their pain is the tightening of post-education work visa norms, which dims chances of higher pay abroad and repay loan sooner back home.In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug. That's an increase of Rs 5 lakh on a Rs 1-crore tuition-plus-expenses budget.At the same time, the UK has proposed requiring international graduates to secure graduate-level jobs with salaries between 36,000-40,000 pounds to stay beyond two years. Canada too is tightening immigration rules for Indian students, by allowing officials to cancel permits and ending the Student Direct Stream visa program.""Earlier, students used the post-education work visa to earn in dollars and repay a large part of their loans. For Indian students in undergraduate programs, the impact could be severe as their total cost of education is in excess of Rs 1.5 crore in the US,"" said Ajay Bohora, co-founder of education loan company HDFC Credila.This means either a longer repayment period or higher EMIs on their education loans , said Bohora. The weak rupee also increases costs for students flying back. According to Bohora, the higher financial burden on families will require students to be more frugal.""I am now sending $800 a month instead of $900 for my daughter's food & board in the US. Govt has, on top of that, put TCS, which is an additional burden. So, on my tax-paid money, I am paying tax for the second time via TCS. Though I can get a refund, it has blocked my tax-paid money for a year,"" said Sudha Pai, a Mumbai resident.""While fluctuations are a regular phenomenon, this year there has been a huge upward rise in the dollar. Coupled with the uncertainty caused by the political scenario in the wake of elections, the impact on overseas education has been huge,"" said K P Singh, an education counsellor & founder, Institute of Management & Foreign Studies.According to Karan Gupta, a career counsellor, parents can 'lock in' foreign exchange rates by getting a loan sanctioned early and transferring funds to the university account to hedge against depreciation. ""Students should avoid foreign currency loans, as it would be more expensive to repay when they return to India. They should also apply to universities that offer financial aid and scholarships, thereby reducing their financial burden,"" said Gupta.Bohora attributes the restrictions on student work visas to ""economic patriotism,"" which is on the rise in the US, the UK, and Canada.The US has signalled its intent to attract highly skilled global talent to drive technological innovation and economic growth. Indian students who want to pursue higher education in the US would have to explore emerging fields such as GenAI, cybersecurity, distributed finance, blockchain, and digital currencies to enhance job prospects.According to Singh, students should not focus solely on traditional fields like coding and programming but should explore new-age areas. He added that those without the financial resources should not take risks by pursuing courses with limited employment potential.","In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug.

Sahil Bloom with family

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

In a semi-kayfabe culture of productivity hacks and KPIs, Sahil Bloom has some real insights. The investor, entrepreneur, and author sits across from me in his office, occasionally glancing at what I imagine is a meticulously structured calendar. His recent book, “The 5 Types of Wealth,” has been gaining traction not just in business circles but among a broader audience seeking a more comprehensive approach to success.“Money is an enabler, not a goal,” Bloom states with conviction early in our conversation. It's a sentiment that might sound trite coming from someone else, but Bloom's background in finance and investing lends the observation a certain gravitas. “What gets measured gets managed,” he continues, referencing Peter Drucker . “Money's measurability means that for most people, that's the only thing they focus on and optimize around.”This observation forms one pillar of Bloom's philosophy: We've been measuring the wrong things. Through his research and conversations with successful individuals, Bloom identified four recurring themes that contribute to a fulfilling life: time, people, purpose, and health. The financial component, while important, serves primarily as an enabler rather than an end in itself.“A big part of the book, and the entire idea, is that we need to measure the bigger picture of what really matters in building a fulfilling life,” he explains. “These other things in addition to money. Money is not nothing. It simply can't be the only thing.”When pressed about the three most important decisions that shape our lives—where to live, who to be with romantically, and what to do professionally—Bloom resists offering prescriptive advice. “It's very hard for me to tell you what you should care about.” Instead, he emphasizes the meta-perspective: creating space to ask these questions in the first place. “You need to stop and pause and create the space necessary to come to your own answers for them,” he insists. “That is what's important. It's not someone telling you 'here are the answers.' It's that you are given and allowed and pushed to create the space to ask them in the first place.”This approach reflects Bloom's belief that self-awareness is paramount in decision-making. But how does one distinguish between authentic desires and mimetic ones—those we've absorbed from our environment? Bloom references a conversation with his friend Derek Thompson , a writer at The Atlantic: “Do you want the job, or do you want other people to see you have this job?”He elaborates: “Would you take that job or buy that thing if no one else in the world would figure out or find out that you had it? Would you still want to do it? That's a really good way of cutting through the noise.”I also asked Bloom about the evergreen skills that will remain valuable regardless of technological advances. His answer is immediate and confident.“I think the two skills that will continue to matter no matter what are storytelling and sales,” he says. “Storytelling and sales are fundamentally everything when it comes to your life. The CEOs of the biggest companies in the world are not the smartest people at their organizations. They are the best storytellers.”This perspective challenges conventional thinking about technical expertise. “Ten years ago, you would have said software engineering is such a durable skill. Well, I could create a case where software engineering is a totally obsolete skill because of AI in ten years,” Bloom observes. “What that means is that the meta-skills are what really matter.”But how does one become a good storyteller? Per Bloom, it's about deliberate practice and acute observation. “Every single time I talk about anything, I am paying attention to the things that are making your eyes light up. I'm paying attention to the things that are making you lean in. I'm paying attention to the things where you look confused,” he explains. “Every single time you are telling your story, you should be gathering information and data to make your story even better the next time you do it.”Perhaps the most striking aspect of my conversation with Bloom is his unwavering commitment to delayed gratification. In an era of instant validation, though, his approach seems almost ancient (and wise).“I fundamentally believe that delayed gratification is the key to life,” he states with remarkable certainty. “Delayed gratification is effectively the cheat code that allows you to build the life that you want.”This philosophy manifests in his daily routine and work ethic. “If all I have to do to provide for my family is wake up at 4am every single day, I have to be able to get myself up and do that,"" he says, his voice taking on an edge of intensity. “It doesn't matter how I feel, because if I followed how it felt on a daily basis, I would never get started on anything.”This willingness to override short-term discomfort for long-term gain permeates Bloom's thinking about relationships as well. “Marriage is sacrificing short-term freedom in order to achieve long-term freedom of a fulfilling, happy life,” he observes. “That is really the fundamental trade-off that we constantly come into tension with.”In between our discussion on productivity and discipline, Bloom endorses boredom. In our hyper-stimulated world, he sees deliberate periods of non-stimulation as essential.“Create space to retreat, to pause, to create solitude for yourself,” he advises. “This is like the hidden life hack that no one talks about—that you need to have a boredom ritual in your life.”Bloom cites Pascal: “Blaise Pascal said all of humanity's problems come from the inability to sit in a room alone, and that's very true.” For Bloom, these periods of boredom aren't extensive—""probably like 15 minutes a day of true boredom”—but they're non-negotiable. “It's very uncomfortable when you first do it because you're so unused to zero stimulation. The only time you ever have zero stimulation is when you're in the shower, and it's no wonder that you have your best ideas there.”This approach to intentional boredom connects to his journaling practice, which again reflects Bloom's pragmatic nature. Rather than lengthy introspection, he employs what he calls the “1-1-1 method”: “Three minutes, and you write down one win from the day, something you feel good about; one point of stress or tension, something you're stressed about; and then one point of gratitude, something that you were grateful for during the day. Takes literally two to three minutes, and you never have an excuse to not do it.”The primary benefit? Better sleep. “I fall asleep much more quickly. I feel way less anxious when I get into bed because I got that thing off my brain and onto the paper.”Bloom also offers a perspective on relationships that aligns with his long-term thinking. “I approach every single new relationship with a question: If I were to assume that I am going to know this person for the next 50 years, how would I approach this relationship, this first meeting?”The answer reflects his non-transactional philosophy: “I wouldn't ask for anything, for sure. I would probably just try to really understand a person and start to go deep and understand who this person is, what their motivations are, what they're all about. People that approach life quid pro quo and approach things in a transactional way very rarely achieve the best outcomes in life.”His approach to maintaining relationships is similarly intuitive rather than systematic. “I don't have a CRM. I just do everything off of feel. When I think something about someone, I just send them the text, and I do it right then, because I think that inspiration around relationships is very perishable.”As our time draws to a close, I ask Bloom what people most commonly misunderstand about building a fulfilling life. His answer crystallizes the philosophy that underpins his book and worldview.“The single biggest mindset shift people need to have is to recognize that investments in all of these areas of your life compound in the same way as financial investments,” he says with particular emphasis. “We don't think that way. We don't think about investments in relationships compounding. We don't think about investments in our health or in our purpose as compounding, but they do.”This insight leads to the final one: “Anything above zero compounds. Doing a tiny bit today—sending the one text, going for the 15-minute walk—all of those things are better than doing nothing. Anything above zero compounds. That mindset will change your life.”In a world fragmented by competing metrics and definitions of success, Bloom’s approach suggests that fulfillment may lie not in the grand gestures but in small, consistent actions across multiple dimensions of wealth—actions whose value, like compound interest, becomes apparent only with the passage of time.","Sahil Bloom is an investor, entrepreneur, and author.

Buffett’s assurance on cash reserves

Big bets on Japan’s trading giants

Berkshire Hathaway’s outlook

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has reassured shareholders regarding Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial cash reserves, signaling that the funds will be strategically deployed to fuel future growth.Addressing concerns about the company’s massive $321.4 billion cash pile, Buffett, in his annual letter to shareholders, dismissed speculations that it signals an impending economic downturn. He emphasized his plans to make significant investments, particularly in one major emerging market.Despite the growing cash reserves, Buffett clarified that Berkshire Hathaway’s focus remains firmly on equity investments. He explained that while the firm’s cash reserves have reached unprecedented levels, the majority of Berkshire’s value remains tied up in equities, with no intention to shift away from this strategy. As of the last quarter, Berkshire had refrained from stock buybacks for the second consecutive period, leading some analysts to speculate that Buffett didn’t see the company’s stock as undervalued. However, Buffett reassured that the company’s core preference for equities would not change.Buffett also revealed where some of this enormous cash reserve will be allocated. Berkshire Hathaway has already made significant investments in Japan, particularly in the country’s five largest trading houses: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. These companies, known as ""sogo shosha,"" are involved in diverse sectors ranging from commodities to shipping and steel. Buffett expressed confidence in these firms, citing their strong integration into Japan’s economy and their diversified business models, which closely mirror Berkshire Hathaway’s investment philosophy.Buffett indicated that Berkshire would likely increase its stake in these companies over time, noting that they had agreed to allow Berkshire to surpass the 9.9% ownership limit previously set. By the end of 2024, Berkshire’s holdings in these Japanese trading houses had reached $23.5 billion, with the potential for further growth. Buffett’s long-term vision for these investments reflects his strategy of investing in businesses he understands and trusts.Berkshire Hathaway’s total market value surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in 2024, a milestone that Buffett attributed to the company’s culture of long-term reinvestment and compounding returns. Despite a slight decline in profits, from $96.2 billion to $89 billion, Buffett encouraged investors to focus on operating earnings, which saw a significant rise from $37.4 billion to $47.4 billion in 2023.Buffett reiterated the importance of reinvesting Berkshire’s revenues, rather than paying dividends, which has yielded substantial returns over time. He credited the success of this approach to the power of compounding and sustained savings.","Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has reassured shareholders regarding Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial cash reserves.

Pi coin surges after Open Mainnet launch: Can it reach $100 or $500 by 2030?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pi-coin-surges-after-open-mainnet-launch-can-it-reach-100-or-500-by-2030/articleshow/118563592.cms,"Pi coin (Photo: ET)

Can Pi coin reach $100?

Will Pi Coin ever hit $500?

What’s Next for Pi Coin?

Pi Network officially launched its Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025, marking a shift from a closed ecosystem to full decentralization. The launch resulted in price fluctuations, with Pi Coin initially surging to $1.97, before dipping to $0.737, and then rebounding 80% to $1.29.As of February 24, 2025, Pi Coin is trading at around $1.55, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.18 billion.Despite still being far from the $10 mark, some crypto analysts believe Pi Coin has significant growth potential, especially if adoption increases and major exchanges begin listing it. OKX has already announced plans to enable Pi Coin trading once the network meets its listing criteria and completes a successful transition. Market experts suggest that for Pi Coin to hit the $100 mark, it will need robust demand, increased trading liquidity, and widespread adoption as a digital asset.Looking ahead, reports like those from Fortune India suggest that if Pi Network evolves into a widely accepted digital currency with real-world use cases, its price could potentially exceed $500 by 2030. However, this depends on various factors, including continuous development, mass adoption, and regulatory compliance. Analysts warn that Pi Coin's long-term growth could face challenges without strong real-world utility and developer engagement.Following its Open Mainnet launch , the focus now shifts to whether Pi Coin can maintain momentum and attract wider adoption. While this is a significant step forward, Pi Coin’s future will depend on its ability to build utility and trust among users and investors. The trajectory of Pi Coin will be influenced by how the network navigates challenges in a competitive and regulatory-heavy environment, ultimately determining whether it can surge towards $100, $500, or beyond.Disclaimer: Recommendations, views, and opinions expressed by experts are their own and do not reflect the views of The Times of India.","Pi Network officially launched its Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025.

NEW DELHI: The proposed free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the United Kingdom is ""genuinely beneficial"" to both countries as it would help boost bilateral trade and investments, UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds said on Tuesday. India and the UK on Monday announced resumption of negotiations for the FTA, which is expected to double or even triple bilateral trade from the current USD 20 billion in the next 10 years.Reynolds met Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal to discuss about the agreement.After concluding the two-day talks with the Indian minister, Reynolds said: ""This is about an agreement which is genuinely beneficial to both countries. That is possible. That's the prize.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

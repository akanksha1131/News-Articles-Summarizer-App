Benchmark indices extended its corrective consolidation for the third week in a row. Investors stayed on the sidelines, tracking developments on US–China and US–India trade negotiations. India’s economic fundamentals stayed strong, supported by a robust manufacturing & service PMI and steady GST collections, indicating healthy growth momentum in the economy.Over the past ten trading sessions, the Nifty has undergone a corrective retracement of approximately 600 points, effectively unwinding the overbought readings that had emerged on the daily stochastic oscillator following a sharp 1,500-point rally over the preceding four weeks. This measured pullback should be viewed as a healthy consolidation within the broader uptrend rather than the onset of a major reversal. We recommend utilizing this phase as an opportunity to accumulate quality large-cap and sectoral leaders in a staggered manner, keeping a short- to medium-term investment horizon.Technically, the index is now approaching a crucial demand zone between 25,500 and 25,300, which is expected to act as a strong support base. This zone coincides with multiple technical confluences:From a price structure perspective, the medium-term trend remains constructive as long as the index sustains above this pivotal support band.A decisive formation of a higher high and higher low will signal a pause in the current decline and open pullback towards immediate resistance of 25,850. Beyond this, the 26,100 level, which represents the twin highs of the past two weeks, would serve as the next key resistance and potential trigger for a renewed leg higher.The stock remains in steady up trend forming higher high and higher low in the long-term chart. The entire up move of CY25 is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels.The stock has strong support at 260-258 levels being the confluence of the key retracement and 144 days EMA.We expect the stock to head towards the recent all time high placed at 298 in the coming month.The stock has witnessed a steady pullback post its quarterly numbers and is currently placed above its short- and medium-term averages.We expect the stock to extend its current pullback and head towards 567 levels in the coming month being the trendline resistance joining recent highs.Immediate support is placed at 500-490 levels being the confluence of key retracement and trendline support joining recent lows. The daily 14 periods RSI is in buy mode thus supports the positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 7, 2025 are Manappuram Finance, and Dabur India.

‘Trump’s Team In Serious Discussions With India’: White House As India-US Trade Talks Continue



Why is Russian crude oil idling on the sea?

Economic impact of sanctions

India, China look away from Russian oil

Can the world permanently ignore Russian oil?





US President Donald Trump’s latest sanctions on Russian crude oil firms appears to have had the intended impact - at least as of now. Refiners are reportedly unwilling to pick up Russian crude oil from ships, wary of US sanctions.According to a Bloomberg report, seaborne crude exports from Russia have seen a significant decline, marking the steepest drop since January 2024, as recent US sanctions caused main purchasers to distance themselves from Russian oil.The discharge of cargo has seen a more substantial decrease compared to loading activities, resulting in increased oil volumes at sea.Data from vessel tracking compiled by Bloomberg indicates that the four-week average volumes from Russian ports reached 3.58 million barrels per day until November 2, showing a reduction of approximately 190,000 from the adjusted figures for the period ending October 26.The four-week average provides a more accurate representation of underlying patterns compared to the more fluctuating weekly statistics, which also decreased.The decline in oil movement impacted Moscow's oil revenue, which dropped to its lowest point since August, following US restrictions on transactions with Russia's leading exporters, Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC.While Russian exporters continue loading crude onto vessels, refineries show reduced willingness to transfer the cargo to their storage facilities.This has resulted in Russian crude at sea increasing to over 380 million barrels, with a rise of 27 million barrels, or 8% from early September, according to Bloomberg's tanker-tracking information.Refineries in China, India and Turkey are currently suspending purchases of sanctioned shipments and exploring different supply options, according to the report.India, China and Turkey dominate Russia's seaborne crude exports, accounting for over 95% of the total volume. Any substantial reduction in their purchases cannot be easily offset.Russia is likely to continue loading vessels even if they remain in floating storage, making offshore oil reserves an increasingly crucial indicator of the sanctions' effectiveness.During the week ending November 2, vessel-tracking data and port-agent reports indicated that 21.11 million barrels of Russian crude were loaded onto 26 tankers. This represented a decrease from the previous week's revised figure of 26.41 million barrels transported by 34 vessels.The daily average shipments dropped to 3.02 million barrels, reaching the lowest level in 10 weeks during the period ending November 2. Additionally, three Kebco grade shipments from Kazakhstan were dispatched, with two from Ust-Luga and one from Novorossiysk. All regions reported reduced shipments, except De Kastri, which maintained consistent flows from the Sakhalin 1 project.Leading European oil company executives have cautioned that global oil supplies will be affected by restrictions on dealings with Russia's four largest crude exporters, potentially limiting any surplus in the coming year.The four-week average gross value of Russian exports decreased by approximately $90 million to $1.36 billion weekly in the 28-day period ending November 2, affected by declining quantities and prices.The export prices showed notable reductions. Baltic and Black Sea Urals crude decreased by about $0.60 per barrel to $51.42 and $51.79 respectively. Pacific ESPO crude prices reduced by $0.80, averaging $59.20 per barrel, staying under the G-7 price cap of $60 for two consecutive weeks. Indian delivery prices also decreased by $0.60 to $62.13 per barrel, as reported by Argus Media.The weekly export value for the seven days to November 2 averaged $1.15 billion, showing a 27% reduction from the revised figures of the period ending October 26.Major Indian refineries, which typically purchase approximately 1 million barrels of Russian crude daily, are temporarily halting acquisitions until alternative arrangements can be established.This is anticipated to affect deliveries in December and January, with loadings scheduled to begin this month at Russian ports. India's government-operated refineries are exploring options to maintain some cargo receipts from smaller suppliers rather than Russia's sanctioned energy corporations.Chinese refineries are implementing similar restrictions. Government-controlled entities Sinopec and PetroChina Co. have withdrawn from some Russian cargo agreements following US sanctions, the Bloomberg report said.According to Rystad Energy AS, this cautious approach could impact up to 45% of China's total seaborne crude imports from Russia, approximately 400,000 barrels daily. This might affect Russia's primary ESPO grade, dispatched from Kozmino port in the Pacific, which typically reaches northern Chinese refineries after a brief sea journey.Turkish refiners, ranking third globally in Russian crude imports, are now reducing their purchases and diversifying their supply sources to include Iraq, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan.Some industry experts believe this shift is not permanent. ""Down the line, you will see that more and more of the disrupted Russian oil, one way or another, finds its way to the market,"" Gunvor Group Chief Executive Officer Torbjörn Törnqvist was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. ""It always does somehow.""In a separate development, Russian crude processing showed an uptick in the last week of October, with facilities increasing production following seasonal maintenance and Ukrainian drone attacks. However, operations are expected to decline this week following another strike, the seventh this year, targeting Rosneft's Saratov facility.Despite significant declines in crude shipments to China and India, substantial volumes remain on vessels without declared destinations, suggesting potential adjustments to these patterns. Vessels increasingly withhold their final destination details until traversing the Arabian Sea, whilst some maintain this ambiguity even during discharge, the Bloomberg report said.The four-week period to November 2 saw flows to Chinese ports reduce to 970,000 barrels daily, whilst Indian-bound shipments decreased to 940,000 barrels per day from a revised 1.16 million barrels daily in the period to October 26. Additionally, vessels carrying over 1.3 million barrels per day have yet to declare their final destinations.Approximately 1.2 million barrels daily originate from Russian western ports indicating Port Said or Suez Canal destinations, or Pacific ports without specific delivery points. A further 140,000 barrels daily are on vessels without any destination signals.Historically, these shipments predominantly reached India or China, however, strengthened US sanctions might keep these supplies at sea unless Russian sellers develop alternative arrangements.","US President Donald Trump's latest sanctions on Russian crude oil firms appears to have had the intended impact. Refiners in China, India and Turkey are currently suspending purchases of sanctioned shipments and exploring different supply options. The decline in oil movement impacted Moscow's oil revenue, which dropped to its lowest point since August.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125105394,imgsize-89784,width-400,resizemode-4/russia-crude-oil.jpg"

Gold and silver price prediction today: Gold prices are showing signs of exhaustion, and traders should adopt a cautious approach, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group. He shares his views on gold and silver:MCX Gold has shown signs of exhaustion after its recent rally and appears to have some room for a corrective move on the downside. Prices have been trading in a broad range, and the momentum seems to be cooling off as profit booking sets in. Currently, gold is likely to test the lower range of 117000–115000 levels before finding a strong support base for the next leg of the uptrend. The overall structure remains positive in the medium to long term, but short-term weakness cannot be ruled out.A firm resistance is placed at 122500, and only a sustained close above this level will indicate renewed bullish momentum. Until then, prices may consolidate or drift lower amid global cues and dollar strength. Investors should watch for stability around the 117000–115000 zone, which could act as a crucial accumulation area.Once prices rebound from these supports, a move back toward 122500 and higher levels can be expected.Traders are advised to remain cautious, adopt a disciplined stop-loss approach, and look for buying opportunities near support zones rather than chasing prices at higher levels. The broader outlook for gold continues to remain positive with healthy fundamentals.MCX Silver has been under pressure recently, showing signs of weakness after failing to sustain above key resistance levels. The metal has faced consistent selling at higher levels, indicating that the bulls are losing grip in the short term. With bearish momentum gaining traction, prices may continue to decline and could tumble toward the 141500 level, which serves as a crucial support zone. A break below this support may trigger further downside, while any recovery attempts are likely to face stiff resistance near 148700 levels.The broader market sentiment for silver remains cautious, influenced by a stronger U.S. dollar, rising bond yields, and subdued demand from industrial users. Technically, the chart structure suggests that the recent rebound was merely a pullback within a broader corrective phase. Traders should remain vigilant, as volatility is expected to persist.For short-term traders, selling on rallies with a strict stop-loss above 148700 could be a prudent strategy. On the other hand, long-term investors may consider accumulating near the 141500 support zone if prices stabilize. Overall, MCX Silver remains vulnerable to further downside pressure unless it breaks above 148700 decisively, which would indicate a shift in trend and open the door for a potential recovery.","Gold prices are showing signs of exhaustion, and traders should adopt a cautious approach, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

"Longest government shutdown in US history: Trump, Democrats at impasse; Americans brace for widening fallout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/longest-government-shutdown-in-us-history-trump-democrats-at-impasse-americans-brace-for-widening-fallout/articleshow/125102394.cms,"FULL: ‘Dems, Drop F-bombs, Ignore Americans’: Mike Johnson’s Furious Outburst | US Shutdown Day 30

Mounting pressure on travel and welfare

Political stalemate over healthcare





The United States has entered uncharted territory as the ongoing government shutdown surpassed all previous records, becoming the longest-ever on Wednesday, exceeding the 35-day benchmark set during Donald Trump ’s first term. The stalemate—rooted in a bitter dispute over healthcare spending—has left federal agencies shuttered, key welfare programmes suspended, and millions of Americans bracing for deepening disruptions.Since Congress failed to approve funding beyond September 30, large parts of the federal government have ceased operations. The impact is widening each day, with food assistance for millions halted and roughly 1.4 million federal employees—including air traffic controllers, TSA officers, and park wardens.The administration has issued fresh warnings of widespread travel chaos if the deadlock persists. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cautioned that extended staff shortages could soon lead to “mass flight delays, cancellations, and even airspace closures.”The American Automobile Association (AAA) projects record Thanksgiving air travel this year, with 5.8 million Americans expected to fly during the November 27 holiday. Yet, over 60,000 air traffic controllers and TSA officers are currently unpaid, raising fears of absenteeism similar to 2019, when sick calls from unpaid workers effectively forced an end to the previous shutdown.Meanwhile, the White House has warned of possible benefit suspensions, including partial disruptions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP), though it pledged to comply with court mandates to distribute emergency payments.At the heart of the deadlock lies a dispute over healthcare funding. Democrats are demanding that Congress address expiring insurance subsidies before reopening the government, while Republicans insist operations resume first. Despite signs of movement from a few centrist Democrats—who have proposed a framework to curb insurance costs—party leadership on both sides remains entrenched.Trump has ruled out compromise, telling CBS News that he would “not be extorted.” His administration has also signalled readiness to tighten spending on progressive programmes, further hardening partisan divides.As the shutdown enters its sixth week with no resolution in sight, economists warn of growing damage to the nation’s economy and institutions—making this not only the longest government shutdown in US history but also one of its most consequential.Food assistance, child care support, and numerous other government services have been severely disrupted, while hundreds of thousands of federal employees have either been furloughed or required to work without pay.","US government shutdown becomes longest-ever on Wednesday, exceeding 35-day benchmark set during Donald Trump ’s first term.

'Unfair, Unjustified': Piyush Goyal Exposes US Tariff Logic, Says India Won’t Accept One-Sided Rules

Trump’s tariffs face SC test

Trump administration expresses confidence





US President Donald Trump ’s reciprocal tariffs, that have shaken the world economy, are facing their final test with the Supreme Court hearing cases that question the measure’s legality.Trump has sought the Supreme Court's support to maintain tariffs, which he has utilised as a crucial economic and diplomatic instrument. An adverse ruling would represent a significant shift for the court, which has previously supported his extensive measures through interim decisions across various domains, including immigration enforcement, dismissal of federal agency officials, and restrictions on transgender military service.Trump employed the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement tariffs on virtually all US trading partners. This legislation permits presidential regulation of commerce during national emergencies. He was the first president to utilise IEEPA for this specific purpose.According to a Reuters reoport, Justices of the US Supreme Court expressed scepticism on Wednesday regarding the validity of President Donald Trump's broad tariff policies in a case that could affect global trade and serves as a significant assessment of Trump's authority.Both conservative and liberal justices vigorously questioned the Trump administration's legal representative about the legitimacy of using a 1977 emergency-focused legislation as justification for Trump's tariff implementation, considering whether this action infringed upon congressional jurisdiction.Some conservative justices, however, also emphasised presidential authority in foreign relations, indicating a possible division within the court on this matter. The current court composition stands at a 6-3 conservative advantage.The session, which extended beyond 2-1/2 hours, addressed appeals from the administration following lower court decisions that deemed Trump's application of the relevant law excessive. The challenges came from affected businesses and 12 US states, predominantly under Democratic leadership.Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts addressed US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration's representative, saying, ""the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress.""The implementation of tariffs, which are essentially import duties, could generate substantial revenue amounting to trillions of dollars for the United States in the coming ten years. Congress holds the constitutional authority to levy taxes and tariffs.Chief Justice Roberts indicated the possibility of applying the ""major questions"" doctrine, which necessitates explicit congressional authorisation for executive branch decisions having significant economic and political implications.""The justification is being used for a power to impose tariffs on any product, from any country, in any amount, for any length of time. I'm not suggesting it's not there, but it does seem like that's major authority, and the basis for that claim seems to be a misfit,"" Roberts said.The ""major questions"" doctrine was previously utilised by the Supreme Court to invalidate significant policies implemented by Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Sauer regarding his assertion that IEEPA's provisions, which grant presidents emergency authority to regulate importation, encompass tariffs.Barrett questioned Sauer about historical precedents where the specific phrase 'regulate importation' was used to grant tariff-imposing authority.IEEPA authorises presidential action during ""an unusual and extraordinary threat"" in national emergencies, traditionally used for enemy sanctions or asset freezing.Sauer explained that Trump identified US trade deficits as a critical economic and security threat, with tariffs facilitating trade negotiations. He warned that dismantling these agreements ""would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure with ruinous economic and national security consequences.""Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson emphasised that IEEPA was created to restrict, not enhance, presidential powers.""It's pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president,"" Jackson said according to the Reuters report.During the proceedings, Sauer emphasised presidential authority in international relations, contending that the ""major questions"" doctrine was not relevant in this situation.Justice Brett Kavanaugh displayed potential support for Trump's position by challenging the notion of unprecedented action. He referenced President Richard Nixon's implementation of a global tariff under IEEPA's precursor legislation in the 1970s, which contained comparable provisions regarding import regulation.""That's a good example for you,"" Kavanaugh remarked to Sauer.The Supreme Court has historically granted substantial latitude to presidential foreign policy decisions. Chief Justice Roberts highlighted this whilst questioning Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing private business challengers, noting Trump's tariffs' effectiveness in negotiating trade agreements.Between February 4 and September 23, the IEEPA-based tariffs collected an estimated $89 billion, according to US Customs and Border Protection agency data.""Sure, the tariffs are a tax, and that's a core power of Congress, but they are a foreign-facing tax, right? And foreign affairs is a core power of the executive,"" Roberts stated to Katyal.Justice Neil Gorsuch's line of questioning indicated his concern that Sauer's assertions about presidential foreign affairs authority could potentially compromise the Constitution's separation of powers between executive and legislative branches.""What would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce - or for that matter, declare war - to the president?"" Gorsuch enquired.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attended Wednesday's proceedings and later expressed strong confidence on ""Kudlow"" programme after observing the arguments. He indicated that alternative legal mechanisms would be employed to maintain Trump's tariffs if the Court rules unfavourably.Trump's additional tariffs, implemented under different legislation, remain outside this case's scope.Despite the Supreme Court's usual practice of deliberating for months after hearings, the Trump administration has requested swift action, though the decision timeline remains uncertain.","US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, that have shaken the world economy, are facing their final test with the Supreme Court hearing cases that question the measure's legality.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) said that trade talks with India are “going good” and signalled that he might visit the country next year.Addressing reporters at the White House, Trump again shifted focus to the issue of Moscow’s crude oil, stating, ""They are going good, he stopped buying oil from Russia largely. He is a friend of mine, and we speak and he wants me to go there. ”When further questioned about plans to travel to India in 2026, he added, ""It could be, yes.""Trump's tariffs are now facing a trial in the US Supreme Court, which he has been using as a key tool in both economic and diplomatic strategy. According to a Reuters report, the US Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared doubtful about the legality of his sweeping tariff approach a case that carries implications for global trade and represents a major test of Trump’s executive powers.Trump’s remarks come at a time when India and the United States are negotiating a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), which aims to scale up trade volumes from $191 billion to $500 billion by 2030. The ongoing talks have gained increased attention due to the 50% tariffs currently imposed by the United States on Indian goods.Earlier this week, Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal also provided an update on the negotiations, admitting that although progress is being made, key challenges remain.“Talks are going on very well. There are many sensitive and serious issues, so naturally, it takes some time,” Goyal told ANI, when asked about the status of the ongoing trade discussions.His comments came after a similar update from the White House just hours earlier, which stated that the US President continues to prioritise strengthening ties with India and remains in regular contact with PM Modi, despite unresolved differences over tariffs and Russian oil imports.The White House update followed Trump’s recent acknowledgment of India’s reduced purchase of Russian oil. During his five-day Asia tour, he praised India for cutting back on Russian crude, describing the country as “very good” on the matter.Negotiations over the trade agreement have been active for months. Since March, five rounds of talks have taken place on the first phase of the deal, initially expected to be completed by the “fall of 2025.” On October 23, both sides held virtual consultations. In mid-September, US officials, led by Brendan Lynch, Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, met Indian officials in New Delhi, where both sides agreed to accelerate discussions.The bilateral trade agreement, formally introduced in February following leadership directives, is positioned as a key step towards expanding opportunities for both economies.Indian goods currently face a 50% tariff from the US. This includes a 25% base duty and a 25% additional tariff on top of that. The additional tariffs were announced by the US President accusing India of fueling Moscow’s war machine against Ukraine.","US President Donald Trump said that trade talks with India are “going good” and signalled that he might visit the country next year.

Analysts said for the company Q2FY26 marked another quarter of continued improvement in return on capital employed (ROCE) across major businesses, notably in international ports.Robust underlying demand, market share gains, and overseas expansion underpin its 1,000 million metric ton throughput ambition for 2030. The company’s strategic pivot to focus on ROCE improvement should drive rerating.Citigroup has a buy rating on Paytm with the target price at Rs 1,500. Analysts said the company reported strong growth and market share momentum in credit on UPI (Rupay & Postpaid) is a tailwind that is likely to continue to aid net payment margins ex-devices. Additionally, device costs (across new device capex, refurbishment) have meaningfully declined, improving device economics. They said overall, Paytm reported a solid beat on EBITDA/EBIT on lower cloud costs and lower depreciation & amortisation. They said PayTM’s outlook on growth and EBIT margins are robust.CLSA has a hold rating on Kaynes Technology with the target price slightly reduced to Rs 6,375 from Rs 6,410 earlier. Analysts said the company’s Q2FY26 top line was largely in line while margins were slightly better. It maintained its FY26/FY28/FY30 revenue guidance, indicating consistently strong growth. However, cashflow conversion remained low, with around Rs 510 crore working capital increase largely due to receivables, which the company expects to improve going forward. While analysts are positive on the company on its strong growth outlook, low free cash flow generation could raise risks of consistent fund raise.","Morgan Stanley has an equal-weight rating on SBI.

PhysicsWallah eyes $3.6 billion valuation in IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/physicswallah-eyes-3-6-billion-valuation-in-ipo/articleshow/125147539.cms,"



MUMBAI: From a YouTube channel once to a public listing later this month, PhysicsWallah is set to launch India's first IPO by a major ed-tech company in years. With low-priced courses and a strong social media community built over the years-thanks in parts to wide internet penetration and cheap data packs, the startup founded by Alakh Pandey and Prateek Maheshwari managed to widen its reach in the education market where accessibility is the biggest barrier to learning, even as biggest player Byju's perished in its pursuit of unchecked growth.PhysicsWallah is targeting a valuation of $3.6 billion at the upper end of the price brand set at Rs 109 per share, lower than the $4.2 billion valuation at which the firm's investors bought shares in a small secondary transaction in February. When compared to its last big $210 million funding raised at a valuation of $2.8 billion in September 2024, the IPO valuation is about 29% higher.The Rs 3,480 crore IPO will open for bidding on Nov 11. The WestBridge Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners backed company is raising Rs 3,100 crore through fresh issue of shares while founders Pandey and Maheshwari are selling stakes worth Rs 380 crore. They will hold close to 72% in the company post IPO. ""Other (edtech) companies invested time in marketing and selling....we are obsessed about academics and outcomes. We wanted to list during period of high growth and share the listing gains with others. We never wanted this (IPO) event to be an exit event for our existing investors and we also wanted to create wealth for our future investors,"" Pandey and Maheshwari said in an interview.None of the investors are selling their stakes.The IPO size has been pared to Rs 3,480 crore from Rs 3,820 crore through a reduction in the offer for sale (OFS) component which initially stood at Rs 720 crore.For PhysicsWallah, the idea all along has been to keep its prices lower to broaden accessibility-the average price for its most basic online courses for instance, stand, at Rs 4,000. It, however, has started offering some value-added services as the loss-making startup attempts to improve its profitability trajectory and get more revenues from its paying users. PhysicsWallah will also add more offline centres going ahead. ""Growth has never been a challenge,"" Pandey said.","PhysicsWallah is targeting a valuation of $3.6 billion at the upper end of the price brand set at Rs 109 per share.

Use local languages in banks: Sitharaman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/use-local-languages-in-banks-sitharaman/articleshow/125147403.cms,"



MUMBAI: FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday urged banks to ensure that customers can get service in branches while speaking in the local language and called upon lenders to tweak HR policies to give weightage to local language proficiency during appraisals.She asked banks to restore the human connect in customer service, insisting that technology must complement, not replace, personal interaction.Language friction between public sector bank staff has come to the fore, particularly in Maharashtra and southern India, especially Karnataka. There was recent outrage after a public sector bank manager in Bengaluru refused to speak in Kannada with a customer.The incident prompted condemnation from chief minister Siddaramaiah, a transfer of the executive, and an apology from the bank. Similar cases have exposed ongoing tensions as staff from other states struggle with local languages, causing communication gaps and customer resentment.During an interaction with SBI chairman, Sitharaman said the sector must rethink its approach to customer engagement, especially at the branch level. ""You cannot say you will do everything digitally and reach customers only online. Person-to-person contact was the strength of Indian banks, even before technology, and it helped you make big strides.""A key part of this human touch, she stressed, is language.Calling it ""basic etiquette,"" Sitharaman said banks must ensure customers can converse in their own tongue at branches. ""Language is an important way to communicate with your customers. Even if they know Hindi or English, it gives a nice touch when you speak their language,"" she said. ""We Indians go abroad and say a few words in French or Spanish to please people-but in our own country, because of HR policies, staff are posted without knowing the local language.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

How Musk could receive the $1 trillion









Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package, giving the CEO a pathway to earn as much as $1 trillion if he delivers on a set of long-term performance targets. More than 75% of shareholders backed the plan at Thursday’s meeting, and the announcement was met with cheers.""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" Musk told the audience when he took the stage.The package is designed to keep Musk at Tesla long enough to pursue the technological goals he has set for the company.

If Musk meets all the targets in the plan, he could become the world’s first trillionaire.Musk currently has a net worth of more than $500 billion and is listed as the world’s richest person on Forbes’ real-time billionaire rankings. Under the approved plan, he must meet various milestones linked to Tesla’s market value to receive the full package. The first part becomes available when Tesla reaches a $2 trillion market value.The package also includes goals tied to operating profit and product launches, such as delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles. The plan is structured to keep Musk at Tesla for at least seven and a half years.Musk has said Tesla’s growth potential is significant, stating in July that ""Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far"" if the company meets its goals for autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.Musk will only receive the payout if he achieves the required operational and financial goals.The targets include delivering 20 million vehicles within 10 years.

The average long-term US mortgage rate rose slightly this week, snapping a four-week decline that had brought borrowing costs to their lowest level in over a year, AP reported.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage ticked up to 6.22% from 6.17% a week earlier. A year ago, the rate stood at 6.79%. Last week’s figure was the lowest since October 3, 2024, when it reached 6.12%.Rates on 15-year fixed mortgages - typically favoured by homeowners looking to refinance- also moved higher to 5.5% from 5.41% last week. The rate averaged 6% a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac.Mortgage rates are influenced by a mix of factors, including the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions and investors’ expectations for inflation and growth. They often move in tandem with the 10-year Treasury yield, which serves as a benchmark for pricing home loans.The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.09% on Thursday, down from 4.16% the previous day. Lower borrowing costs typically help boost homebuyers’ purchasing power and enable existing homeowners to refinance at more favourable terms.","The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage ticked up to 6.22% from 6.17% a week earlier.

(AI image)

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

Interestingly, the study finds that India leads the list of countries whose migrants actually contribute more to the US economy, than the benefits they draw from it!

How much do Indian immigrants contribute to US economy?

India leads countries whose migrants contribute more than they draw

An average Indian immigrant actually reduces the US national debt by over $1.6 million over 30 years and increases GDP more than immigrants from any other country! Behind Indian immigrants are the Chinese, who reduce the debt by over $800,000 over 30 years.

Countries whose migrants contribute little or make negative contribution

Other important observations from the study:

Higher education is a distinguishing characteristic among sponsored immigrants, including those with permanent EB visas and temporary work permits such as H-1B, O-1, L-1, and J-1. Being in their early professional years, these individuals have substantial time ahead to contribute to the tax system before accessing retirement benefits.

The primary distinction in fiscal contributions between skilled and unskilled immigrants lies in tax payments, with university graduates contributing 3.3 times more in taxes compared to those without secondary education. Additionally, individuals lacking secondary education receive 2.3 times more governmental assistance than their university-educated counterparts.

Tax Revenue generated by 30-year old immigrant with college degree vs no high school diploma over 10 years

The financial implications vary significantly based on education levels. An uneducated 30-year-old immigrant creates a federal deficit of $20,000 over a decade and $130,000 over three decades. In contrast, a 30-year-old immigrant holding advanced qualifications generates federal savings of $300,000 in ten years and $3.1 million across thirty years.

H-1B visa holders are projected to provide greater economic benefits compared to EB-1 and EB-2 immigrants. The reason being that most EB-1 and EB-2 immigrants previously held H-1B visas and are now at an advanced age, resulting in anticipated net contributions of approximately $1.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively, over three decades.

Benefits received by a 30-year old immigrant with college degree vs no high school diploma over 10 years

Other immigration categories show significantly lower benefits. Diversity visa lottery recipients, who possess notable educational qualifications and are relatively young, contribute about $900,000 more in taxes than they receive in federal benefits over 30 years.

The less-skilled EB-3 immigrant visa holders generate $630,000 in net contributions over 30 years, whilst refugees contribute $420,000 during the same period. DACA recipients, despite initial costs in the first decade, are anticipated to provide $100,000 in net contributions over 30 years.

Educated, legal migrants contribute most to GDP

In terms of economic growth, EB-1 immigrants with extraordinary abilities demonstrate the highest impact, contributing $500,000 to GDP by year 30, followed by H-1B visa holders at £460,000.

STEM PhDs and master's degree holders contribute $410,000, whilst EB-2 visa holders and diversity visa recipients boost GDP by $370,000 and $350,000, respectively, over a 30-year period.

Similar pattern holds true for fiscal impact

What direction should Trump’s immigration policy take?

Removing country-specific limits would benefit Indian applicants awaiting green cards, though this could extend waiting periods for other nationalities.

Enable work authorisation for H-1B visa holders' spouses who face extended green card processing delays.

Grant employment permissions to dependents across multiple skilled visa categories, including H-4, O-3, and TD status holders.

Expand work authorisation to include both visa dependents and international students (F-1/F-2), allowing on-campus and off-campus employment to increase workforce participation.

Implement competitive bidding for EB-5 investor visas to generate additional government revenue.

Allocate H-1B visas based on salary offerings rather than lottery selection to attract higher-paid professionals.

Revise visa reallocation rules to transfer unused family-category visas to employment-based categories.

Redirect Diversity Lottery visa allocations to enhance EB-1 and EB-2 skilled immigration quotas.

Transfer EB-3 visa allocations to EB-1 and EB-2 categories, prioritising exceptional talent and advanced qualification holders.

Discontinue EB-3 ""Other Worker"" classification, redirecting these positions to EB-1 priority workers.

Eliminate sibling-based green card category, reallocating these positions to skilled immigration programmes.

Restructure family-based immigration using points-based assessment focusing on skills and qualifications.

Distribute EB-2 and EB-3 green cards according to salary levels, prioritising higher-paid applicants.

Bottom line:

Is Trump listening?

The Bank of England (BoE) on Thursday kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4%, opting for caution ahead of the UK government’s upcoming budget later this month that is expected to include tax increases, AFP reported.Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank remained confident that rates were on a “gradual path downwards” but stressed that policymakers needed clear signs of inflation returning to the 2% target before considering another cut.“We still think rates are on a gradual path downwards, but we need to be sure that inflation is on track to return to our two-percent target before we cut them again,” Bailey said after the decision, which was widely expected by markets.In a close 5–4 vote, the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee chose to hold rates, with four members supporting a reduction to 3.75%. The move comes as annual inflation stands at 3.8% and economic growth shows signs of stagnation.A rate cut before the budget could have provided relief to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government, which faces political and fiscal challenges ahead of finance minister Rachel Reeves’s November 26 budget.Reeves has already warned of “necessary choices” as Britain grapples with high debt and inflation.“As I take my decisions on both tax and spend, I will do what is necessary to protect families from high inflation and interest rates,” she said earlier this week.Britain’s retail banks typically pass on BoE rate cuts to customers, lowering borrowing costs for households and businesses.

AstraZeneca reported a sharp rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, with strong US growth and robust sales of cancer drugs driving a 77% year-on-year jump in net earnings to $2.53 billion for the third quarter.The British pharmaceutical major said group revenue grew 12% to $15.2 billion, led by oncology treatments that now account for nearly 44% of its total revenue, AFP reported.“We are delivering on our strategy to strengthen our operations in the United States to power our growth,” chief executive Pascal Soriot said in the company’s earnings statement. “This includes a historic agreement with the US government to lower the cost of medicines for American patients, and broadening our US manufacturing footprint.”The company’s expansion in the United States comes after a deal announced last month between AstraZeneca and the Trump administration to reduce drug prices. In return, Washington agreed to delay new tariffs for three years.In July, AstraZeneca unveiled plans to invest $50 billion by 2030 to enhance its US manufacturing and research base. Soriot said the US would represent half of AstraZeneca’s potential revenue by the end of the decade.While reaffirming that Europe would retain “a large industrial base,” Soriot warned that the region risks losing its health sovereignty over the next two decades as newer medical technologies migrate to the US, China, and other markets.Underlining its growing focus on the United States, AstraZeneca shareholders recently approved the company’s plan to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange to attract more investors.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth





Tesla shareholders are set to decide on Thursday whether to approve an unprecedented compensation plan for chief executive Elon Musk that could make him the world’s first trillionaire.The vote will take place during the company’s annual meeting at its factory in Austin, Texas, where the outcome will determine Musk’s future involvement with the electric carmaker.According to CNN, the new stock-based pay proposal would grant Musk as many as 423.7 million additional Tesla shares over the next decade — worth around $1 trillion if the company achieves an $8.5 trillion market valuation.That target represents a 466% jump from Tesla’s current value and about 70% more than Nvidia, which recently reached a $5 trillion market cap.Tesla chair Robin Denholm defended the proposal, saying Musk’s leadership was essential to keeping Tesla’s edge in artificial intelligence, autonomy and robotics. “Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value,” she said in an October 27 message to shareholders, quoted by AFP.The package could raise Musk’s ownership from roughly 12% to more than 25%.Musk has hinted he may “pursue other interests” if the plan is rejected.“It’s not like I’m going to spend the money,” he said during a recent investor call. “It’s just if we build this robot army, I want to have at least a strong influence over that robot army.”The billionaire’s vision for Tesla extends beyond electric vehicles to self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots, which he believes could make the company “the most valuable in the world.”Supporters argue that Musk is pivotal to achieving that transformation. “Shareholders are going to support this overwhelmingly,” said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, as quoted by CNN.However, the proposal has faced pushback from several major investors and proxy advisory firms. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, one of Tesla’s top shareholders, said it would vote against the plan, citing its “size, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk,” reported AFP.Advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) also urged investors to reject the package, criticising its “vague and undemanding” performance targets and its potential to weaken shareholder value.Despite these objections, many analysts believe the plan will likely pass, given Musk’s loyal investor base. A previous compensation vote won 84% approval. Yet critics continue to question the fairness of the proposal.“If you get a trillion dollars over 10 years, that’s $275 million a day. I don’t know anybody who thinks that’s fair,” said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, as quoted by CNN.Anti-Musk protests are also planned outside the Austin gigafactory on the day of the vote.As per AFP, activist Ethan McBride said, “A trillion dollars is way too much any person should have under any circumstances.”","Tesla shareholders are set to decide on Thursday whether to approve an unprecedented compensation plan for chief executive Elon Musk.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap





JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon has said the bank’s workforce is likely to remain steady or even grow as artificial intelligence becomes more deeply embedded in its operations.His comments counter the widespread concern that automation will cause massive job losses across industries.Speaking to CNN, Dimon explained that JPMorgan’s focus is on using AI to enhance efficiency rather than reduce staff numbers.“We always redeploy,” he said, referring to employees whose roles are reshaped by new technology. While acknowledging that AI will reduce workloads in several areas, he emphasised that “it will also create jobs,” particularly in data, analytics and technology infrastructure.His remarks come as several major US companies, including Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, have carried out large-scale layoffs while accelerating their investment in AI.Amazon has already cut around 14,000 corporate roles this year as part of its AI-driven restructuring, sparking debate about the long-term impact of automation on the American workforce.However, JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, has adopted a different stance.Dimon told CNN that although the broader labour market has weakened, it is uncertain whether that trend will persist.As per Bloomberg, he maintained a cautiously optimistic outlook, noting that technological innovation historically generates more employment than it replaces. “There has been a weakening in the broader labour market,” he said, adding, “The economy is still chugging along. It may have gotten a little bit weaker, but right now it’s still kind of in that soft landing.”Praising AI’s potential, Dimon called chipmaker Nvidia an “unbelievable company,” adding that the technology is “real” and capable of making firms “hugely productive.”He compared today’s AI boom to the internet revolution, saying, “They may not all pay off, but you did get Google, Facebook, YouTube, part of Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce… Yeah, there was a little bit of a bubble in there.”Dimon believes AI holds “enormous” potential for breakthroughs in medicine, engineering, and other fields, suggesting that “mankind should benefit.”He admitted that AI could displace up to 80% of jobs in some professions but said new opportunities would arise elsewhere. The key, he added, will be “thoughtful” government support and “proper regulation” if AI evolves faster than society can adapt.",JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon has said the bank’s workforce is likely to remain steady or even grow as artificial intelligence becomes more deeply embedded in its operations.

'Won't Allow People To...': Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal Clarified India's Stand on Cryptocurrency





Bitcoin has slipped below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June, marking a fresh downturn driven by long-term holders cashing out rather than leveraged traders.The world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 7.4% on Tuesday, extending losses to over 20% from its record high a month ago. By Wednesday morning in New York, Bitcoin had rebounded 1.7%, though derivatives traders were still betting on further declines.Unlike October’s sharp collapse, which was triggered by heavy liquidations, the current selloff appears to stem from waning conviction among long-time investors, reported Bloomberg.According to Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, around 400,000 Bitcoins, worth nearly $45 billion, have been sold in the past month, creating instability in the market.“Over 319,000 Bitcoin has been reactivated in the past month, mainly from coins held for six to twelve months — suggesting significant profit-taking since mid-July,” said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, as quoted by Bloomberg.This time, the decline has been driven largely by steady spot selling, rather than the leveraged washouts that defined last month’s crash.CoinGlass data showed about $2 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours — far less than the $19 billion wiped out during October’s rout.Meanwhile, open interest in Bitcoin futures remains muted, with traders buying put options targeting the $80,000 level.Thielen noted that selling pressure is increasingly being fuelled by long-term holders reducing their exposure.“We broke through some on-chain indicators — people are underwater, they need to close their positions,” he said. He added that “mega whales” — entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin — began unloading earlier this year, while institutional demand has faded since the October 10 crash.“The whales are just not buying,” Thielen remarked.Accumulation among holders with 100 to 1,000 Bitcoin has dropped sharply, further weakening market resilience.Thielen warned that the current downturn could persist well into next year.Drawing parallels to the 2021–2022 bear market, when large investors offloaded more than one million Bitcoin over 12 months, he cautioned that the current phase “could see this situation going on for another six months.”","Bitcoin has slipped below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June.

After President Donald Trump raised the cost of H-1B visas to $100,000, the movement of international researchers has become more difficult — and Canada appears poised to capitalize on the shift.The Canadian government unveiled in its first budget under Prime Minister Mark Carney special initiatives to attract more than 1,000 top international researchers and H-1B visa holders while cutting the number of foreign students admitted annually, Bloomberg reported.The plan earmarked 1.7 billion Canadian dollars (Rs 10,000 crore approx) to recruit skilled researchers. “The expertise of these researchers will help advance our global competitiveness and contribute to the economy of the future,” the budget document said.It also proposed an “accelerated pathway” for H-1B visa holders in the coming months following President Donald Trump’s decision to increase fees for H-1B visas to $100,000. However, it maintained tight controls over overall immigration after recent surges in population growth.Under the new immigration plan the govt set a target of 380,000 permanent residents annually for 2026 through 2028. It cut the number of temporary residents to 385,000 in 2026 and 370,000 in both 2027 and 2028, representing a reduction of more than 40 percent from current levels.The reductions are driven by a steep fall in planned new study permits, which are now capped at 155,000 in 2026 and 150,000 in each of the following two years. Those targets compare with 305,900 permits annually for 2025 to 2027 set by the former govt. Universities Canada said “recognizes the government’s efforts to build a sustainable immigration system that welcomes those seeking to study at Canada’s world-class universities, but the plan must match this government’s talent and economic agenda. ”A report by Desjardins said bringing fewer people into the country “should support wage growth in the near-term, as employers bid to attract fewer available workers.” It will likely slow population growth further compared with previous targets but has only minimal impact on gross domestic product forecasts.“The slower population growth should ease shelter inflation, particularly in the rental sector, as temporary foreign workers and international students are likelier to rent. Lastly, the slower pace of population growth should help reverse Canada’s falling GDP per capita,” the report said.The govt now aims to reduce the share of nonpermanent residents to less than 5 percent of the population by the end of 2027, a year later than initially planned. The figure was 7.3 percent on July 1.","The Canadian government unveiled in its first budget under Prime Minister Mark Carney special initiatives to attract more than 1,000 top international researchers.

Shutdown fallout: FAA slashes air traffic by 10% across 40 US hubs; safety risk prompts drastic step,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shutdown-fallout-faa-slashes-flight-volume-by-10-across-40-us-hubs-safety-risk-prompts-drastic-step/articleshow/125122287.cms,"Representative image

FULL PRESSER: 'Mr. Trump, Get In The Game': Jeffries Dares Republicans As Shutdown Hits Day 36





The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 of America’s busiest markets from Friday, an unprecedented move to ensure flight safety as the ongoing government shutdown strains air traffic controllers.The announcement, made Wednesday, could affect thousands of flights daily, as the FAA manages more than 44,000 aircraft movements each day, including commercial, cargo, and private flights.FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said this was a measure he had “not seen in 35 years in aviation,” reported news agency AP.Controllers have been working without pay since the shutdown began on October 1, often clocking six-day weeks with mandatory overtime. Many have been calling in sick, taking second jobs, or struggling with daily expenses, resulting in staff shortages and delays at several airports.Bedford, along with US transportation secretary Sean Duffy, said the decision aimed to prevent a potential safety crisis. “We’re not going to wait for a safety problem to truly manifest itself when the early indicators are telling us we can take action today,” Bedford said.“The system is extremely safe today and will be extremely safe tomorrow.”The FAA and transportation department are meeting airline executives to decide how to apply the reduction before releasing the list of affected airports on Thursday.Major carriers such as United, American, and Southwest said they would adjust schedules to reduce passenger disruption. United CEO Scott Kirby assured staff that cuts would focus on regional routes, not hub-to-hub or long-haul international flights. “That’s important to maintain the integrity of our network,” Kirby said, as quoted by AP.Aviation analytics firm Cirium estimated that the 10% reduction could mean around 1,800 cancelled flights, eliminating nearly 268,000 passenger seats. Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport could lose up to 121 of its scheduled 1,212 flights on Friday, Cirium added.According to NPR, the FAA has been facing persistent shortages at major hubs including Dallas, Houston, Newark, and Phoenix. Controllers have long raised concerns about exhaustion, stagnant wages, and mandatory overtime. “I think we’re reaching a tipping point,” one controller told NPR anonymously, citing fear of retaliation.Travel industry groups and unions have urged Congress to end the shutdown, warning that safety risks could escalate. Duffy said the cuts were a “proactive” measure. “Our heart goes out to those who will have flights disrupted,” he said.“This is what we feel like we have to do to make sure we maintain that safety profile”, he added.The FAA’s weekend reports show worsening staffing levels. From Friday to Sunday, 39 control facilities flagged limited staffing, compared with an average of eight before the shutdown, according to AP.As Duffy noted, lessons from past incidents—such as the January midair collision near Washington National Airport—had shown the cost of acting too late. “We learned from that,” he said. “Now we look at data and try to make moves before there could be adverse consequences.”","FAA will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 of America's busiest markets from Friday.

Asian shares gained on Thursday, recovering some of the previous session’s sharp losses as investor sentiment improved following upbeat US jobs data and a rebound on Wall Street.According to news agency AFP, the rally came after figures from payrolls firm ADP showed that US private sector employment jumped more than expected in the past month, easing concerns over a slowdown in the world’s largest economy.Major markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.1 per cent to 50,768.89, while South Korea’s Kospi inched close to the flatline after an earlier rise.As per CNBC, shares of chip-related firms such as Advantest and Disco Corp gained 3.7 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively, while SoftBank, which tumbled 10 per cent on Wednesday, recovered 1.5 per cent.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.1 per cent to 26,220.02, with Chinese markets also edging up as Shanghai’s Composite gained 0.6 per cent.The Australian S&P/ASX 200 added 0.28 per cent.Meanwhile, newly listed Chinese autonomous vehicle firms WeRide and Pony.ai fell over 12 per cent and nearly 8 per cent, respectively, in their Hong Kong debut.Investors were also monitoring developments in Washington, where AFP said the US Supreme Court justices appeared sceptical about US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs, which had drawn billions in customs revenue.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.48 per cent higher, the S&P 500 rose 0.37 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.65 per cent, buoyed by renewed optimism in artificial intelligence-linked stocks.In commodities, oil prices were largely flat after falling to two-week lows in the previous session amid concerns of weaker demand and growing global supply.Brent crude inched up 2 cents to $63.54 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate held steady at $59.60.As per news agency, analysts at Capital Economics said downward pressure on oil prices is likely to persist, forecasting prices to average $60 per barrel by end-2025.Despite Thursday’s recovery, analysts cautioned that high valuations in technology shares and subdued energy demand could continue to test market stability in the weeks ahead.","Major markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher.

Wall Street stocks found stability on Wednesday following stronger-than-anticipated US employment data, even as Asian markets posted sharp declines and worries about an AI-fueled valuation surge weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq.US private sector employment increased by 42,000 in October, ADP reported, bouncing back from a September decline of 29,000 jobs. The gain nearly doubled forecasts from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, reported AFP.Analysts say these ADP numbers could draw fresh focus as one of the few recent economic indicators, shaping investor expectations around whether the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in December.The major US indices opened the session broadly unchanged. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies continued to face selling pressure, with both Amazon and Apple retreating roughly 1 per cent.O’Hare highlighted semiconductor firm AMD, which is positioning itself as a key player in AI chips and recently reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings. “Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) may be the tell on whether that approach will shine yet again or lose some of its luster,” he said.Shares in AMD opened down 2.7 percent.He added, “If AMD can fight back, chances are other growth stocks will follow,"" as quoted by AFP.Global equities have climbed this year as massive investment poured into companies linked to artificial intelligence, including US giants Nvidia, Amazon, and Apple, alongside Asian firms such as Samsung and Alibaba. However, despite robust earnings, market participants are increasingly cautious about chasing ever-higher stock prices, as most capital remains concentrated in a limited number of large-name firms.Investor sentiment was also pressured by the US government shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest in American history, exceeding the previous 35-day record set during President Donald Trump’s first term. The administration warned of potential travel disruptions during the upcoming holiday period and threatened Americans’ benefits to push for a resolution. A total of 1.4 million federal employees, including air-traffic controllers and park rangers, are either furloughed or working without pay.At around 1430 GMT, New York’s main indices were largely flat, with the Dow at 47,078.11 points, the S&P 500 at 6,770.83, and the Nasdaq Composite up less than 0.1 percent at 23,362.57.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, Camlin Fine Sciences and Equinox India Developments are the top stock picks for today. Here’s their view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for February 7, 2025:The Nifty traded in a range with corrective bias in the last two sessions after 1000 points up move in previous seven sessions highlighting consolidation ahead of the RBI Monetary policy outcome.Going ahead, we expect index to trade with a positive bias while sustaining above the support area of 23,400-23,200 and gradually head towards 24,000-24,200 levels in the coming weeks which is the 38.2% retracement of the previous fall (26277-22786) and upper band of the falling channel containing entire decline of the last four months.Key support is placed at 23,200-23,400 levels being the confluence of the last week low, last Tuesday gap up area and past three weeks breakout area. Stock specific action will continue to remain in focus as we sail through the fag end of the Q3FY25 earnings seasons.Volatility is anticipated to remain elevated due to fluctuating global cues, the RBI monetary policy outcome, and the results of the upcoming Delhi elections.On the market breadth front, the percentage of stocks above the 50-day SMA within the Nifty 500 universe has increased from a bearish extreme of 9% last week to 23%. Additionally, the weekly stochastic oscillator has bounced back from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal, further supporting the positive bias.Bank Nifty in the last two sessions consolidated in a range after rallying 2500 points in the preceding 9 sessions. The index in the process closed above the last three weeks range indicating revival in the upward momentum.We believe 48,900-49,200 to act as immediate support and any dip witnessed hereon should be capitalized as a buying opportunity in quality stock in a staggered manner. We expect the index to head towards 51,200-51,500 levels in the coming sessions being the measuring implication of the last three weeks range breakout and the 50% retracement of the previous decline (53,888-47,844).Volatility is likely to remain elevated on account of RBI monetary policy outcome on Friday. Key support is seen at 48,900-49,200 being the confluence of current week low and 61.8% retracement of the recent up move.The stock is seen breaking above the last five weeks range (140-120) as it is seen rebounding after a base above the 200 days EMA thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily RSI is in uptrend thus supports the positive bias. The stock is expected to head higher towards 157 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the last five weeks range breakout (140-120).The share price of Equinox India Developments is at the cusp of breakout above the falling supply line joining the highs of CY21 and CY24 thus offers entry opportunityThe stock has formed a good base around the 50 day EMA and is forming higher highs and higher lows in the weekly chart. We expect the stock to head higher towards 169 levels in the coming months being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous breather (164-106)","The Nifty traded in a range with corrective bias in the last two sessions.

The revised income tax slabs were announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in her Union Budget 2025 speech. The most important takeaway from the new income tax rules for the upcoming financial year is that individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh will have to pay ZERO tax. For salaried individuals, once the standard deduction of Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime is counted, this income level goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh.Additionally, across the board income tax slab changes mean that individuals under the new tax regime, will now have to pay lower taxes, even at income levels above Rs 12 lakh. There is also the concept of marginal relief, which allows individuals earning just above Rs 12 lakh to not pay taxes more than their additional income.The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples:Confused about the new income tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime?

Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs. 12 lakhs. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh. By increasing this limit to Rs 12 lakh around one crore assessees who were earlier required to pay tax varying from Rs 20,000 to Rs 80,000 will be now paying nil tax.Yes, a standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 is available to a tax payer in the new regime. Therefore, a salaried tax payer will not be required to pay any tax where his income before standard deduction is less than or equal to Rs 12,75,000.Standard deduction of Rs 50,000 is available in old regime.Presently, for AY 2024-25, about 8.75 crore persons have filed their ITRs.

For example, for a person having income of Rs 12,10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax, works out to be Rs. 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakhs + 10% of Rs 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10 thousand). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs. In this case he will be required to pay a tax of Rs 10,000.The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-(i) First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. In the answer given to question no.15 above, tax on the total income of Rs 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:(ii) Tax payable on total income of Rs 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.(iii) Now the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs 61,500) shall be compared with amount exceeding total income upto which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs 12,10,000 - Rs 12,00,000](iv) The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs 10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs 61,500) as tabulated above.(v) Therefore, in the above case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/- = 51,500/-) is allowed.(vi) Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500 - Rs 51,500]Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

RBI repo rate cut

Loan EMIs : After RBI MPC’s decision to cut repo rate, government officials are actively keeping an eye on banks and lenders to ensure rate reductions announced by the central bank are properly transmitted to customers. A high-ranking government official indicated they will engage with banks if the rate cut transmission is not evident in the coming weeks.""There is no stipulated timeline. Each bank's asset-liability committee will take a call, but it should not be the case that there is no, or very marginal, benefit passed on,"" he told ET.The RBI announced a 0.25 percentage point repo rate reduction last week, the first such decrease in five years, potentially leading to lower interest rates on housing loans and other credit facilities.Under new RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra , the MPC reduced the repo rate to 6.25%.""The MPC remains unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target while supporting growth,"" Malhotra said.In 2019, following a 25-basis-point reduction by the central bank, most banks only passed on about 5 basis points, necessitating a meeting between the RBI and banking institutions.Also Read | Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Bonanza for middle class!

"Amazon reports strong earnings for Q4, but stocks dip due to outlook for the 1st quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-strong-earnings-for-q4-but-stocks-dip-due-to-outlook-for-the-1st-quarter/articleshow/117998797.cms,"Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.

Trump’s crypto policies



Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Bitcoin dropped from around $105,000 on Saturday to about $92,000 on Sunday night. However, it later recovered to over $100,000 on Monday after Trump paused tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods.While bitcoin showed some recovery, other cryptocurrencies saw larger losses. Ethereum , dogecoin, and other digital assets declined sharply. Trump’s own meme coin traded at around $19 on Monday, about 75 per cent below its peak when he launched it before his second inauguration.“These are riskier cryptos than bitcoin,” Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency analyst was quoted as saying by news agency Associated. “But it’s a little surprising how big the gap is.”Financial markets also saw major shifts before the tariffs were set to take effect. Trump warned that Americans might feel “some pain” from the tariffs but said the move was necessary. He also suggested that tariffs on the European Union and possibly the United Kingdom could follow.Bitcoin was created in 2009 as digital cash outside government control. Over the years, it has become more mainstream, with its price movements now closely tied to tech stocks.Meme coins, a more volatile part of the crypto market, have also seen sharp declines. First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin, launched before Trump took office, is down nearly 90% from its highest value.Trump, who was once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now embraced digital assets. He has promised to make the US a leader in crypto and has appointed officials supportive of the industry.Despite recent declines, cryptocurrencies have gained value since Trump’s election. Bitcoin remains close to its record high of $109,000.","Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.

But the conservative leader may also be seeking favor with Washington, where the Trump administration said Saturday it would impose its own 25% tariffs on Mexico.Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced Monday that the tariffs would be halted for now to give the two sides more time to negotiate. Trump has demanded that Mexico do more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling across the border.Noboa, who took time away from a re-election campaign to attend Trump's inauguration last month in Washington, has hailed Trump's win as a victory for Latin America.Ecuador's announcement comes amid the South American country's separate and bitter diplomatic dispute with Mexico, which last year severed diplomatic ties after Ecuadorian police broke into the Mexican Embassy to arrest Ecuador's former Vice President Jorge Glas.Ecuador's move was widely condemned as a breach of international law, while Ecuador said that Glas was wanted for fraud and not for political reasons and accused Mexico of illegitimately granting him political asylum at the diplomatic compound.Trade between the two countries is minimal, however, accounting for less than 1% of Mexico's total exports, according to Mexican central bank data.Noboa, heir to a banana fortune, is running Sunday in elections for his first complete constitutional term after being elected 18 months ago to finish the aborted mandate of ex-President Guillermo Lasso.","Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers.

Much of this rally was driven by expectations that his administration would introduce crypto-friendly policies, with Trump himself vowing to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet.""However, despite early optimism, some investors have grown impatient over the lack of concrete regulatory reforms.

US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.The greenback recorded a major gain while weighing down Euro to a two year low and injuring the conventional safe haven Swiss frank to its lowest since May.However, two biggest trading partners for the States’ Canada and Mexico, wasted no time in vowing retaliation measures. China also condemned the move, claiming it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization, news agency Reuters reported.Last month after assuming office, Trump had threatened to hit Canada and Mexico with a 25 per cent tariff and while China stood at a levy of 10 per cent, alleging to combat issues like illegal immigration and drug trade.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, gained 0.11 per cent to 109.65 after hitting a three-week high previously in the session.The tariff news also shifted expectations for Federal Reserve policy . Traders scaled back bets on interest rate cuts, pricing in just 41 basis points of easing this year—down from 47 basis points previously.The US dollar climbed 0.7 per cent to 7.2552 yuan in offshore trading, after briefly hitting a record 7.3765 yuan. With Chinese markets closed for Lunar New Year, traders expect further volatility when trading resumes on Wednesday.It jumped 2.7 per cent to 21.40 Mexican pesos, the highest since March 2022.The Canadian dollar weakened 1.4 per cent to C$1.4755 per US dollar, a level last seen in 2003.It plunged 2.3 per cent to $1.0125, a low last recorded in November 2022, before a minor reverse back to $1.0257.It fell 0.74 per cent reaching $1.2304.Though global markets were tumbling down, the Japanese yen held firm at 155.50 per dollar.US economic data released on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, closely observed by the Federal Reserve—rose 0.3 per cent in the past month, the largest increase since April 2024. This suggests the Fed may be in no rush to resume cutting interest rates.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies took a hit.

Donald Trump Economy: Donald Trump inherits strong economy as US growth rate hits 2.8% in 2024 amid ongoing inflation concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-growth-data-donald-trump-inherits-strong-economy-as-us-growth-rate-hits-2-8-in-2024-amid-ongoing-inflation-concerns/articleshow/117746316.cms,"Consumer spending remains robust



Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should look to increase the income tax threshold for the 30% tax bracket in her Union Budget 2025, says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.According to BankBazaar, three important income tax changes that need to be brought in Budget 2025 are; raising the 30% income tax threshold to Rs 18 lakh, restructuring tax brackets, and implementing a standardised 30% deduction on gross income.""The 30% tax slab has remained at ₹15 lakh since 2020, despite a 21% rise in the Cost Inflation Index,"" Shetty notes. ""We propose increasing this threshold to ₹18 lakh to reflect inflation and offer relief to urban salaried individuals burdened by rising costs."" This modification would help distribute the tax responsibility more equitably amongst higher-income earners.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Make NPS more attractive - here's how Shetty expresses concerns about solely increasing the tax-free income limit. ""Calls to raise tax-free income to ₹10 lakh are well-intentioned but shift the tax burden to higher earners. Bracket enhancements should be secular, ensuring fairness across all income levels,"" he explains. ""As per the AY2023-24 figures, just 2% of taxpayers contributed 77% of income tax. A balanced approach is necessary.""Regarding diminishing long-term savings and insurance adoption, Shetty observes, ""The absence of deductions in the new tax regime has led to reduced interest in essential financial protections. Life insurance penetration is dropping, and ELSS inflows are falling despite strong equity performance.""Also Read | Budget 2025: Reduce income tax rates, exceptionally high compared to other countries, says Assocham He adds, ""Fewer salaried individuals are engaging with small savings schemes, and interest in NPS remains low.

The incentive to save and to insure—tax deductions—must continue.""Shetty advocates for a 30% flat deduction on gross income with a ₹15 lakh ceiling on deductions. ""A simplified deduction structure would incentivise savings, insurance, and long-term financial planning, vital for household stability.""","Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should look to increase the income tax threshold for the 30% tax bracket, says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.

Union Budget 2025: Travel and Tourism Industry Experts Share Key Expectations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2025-travel-and-tourism-industry-experts-share-key-expectations/articleshow/117516194.cms,"With the Union Budget 2025 approaching, the anticipation among different sectors is palpable. Growth, innovation, and resilience are the broader expectations from the upcoming budget 2025. If we go to a specific industry, then the travel and tourism sector is looking forward to infrastructural development, better connectivity on both regional and international levels, and reduced taxes are some of the major points. Addressing the evolving needs of the sector industry leaders and experts have shared their pre-budget expectations.In this ever-evolving world, Umesh Chowdhary, VC & MD, Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd. is expecting modernization from the budget 2025. He shares, “We hope the upcoming Union Budget 2025 will continue its focus on the modernization of rolling stock, urban mobility, and infrastructure enhancements. India's metro systems, now among the largest globally, have significantly transformed urban life and mobility. Equally crucial is the continued development of safety, infra, and rolling stock to improve trade connectivity and drive economic growth. We anticipate a strong commitment to the ""Make in India"" initiative and reflective policies within the sector, strengthening domestic manufacturing and boosting exports. We hope that the budget would provide a clear roadmap for India’s transportation future, positioning the nation as a global leader in seamless mobility.”Echoing the same sentiment, Dr. Raghupati Singhania, Chairman & Managing Director, JK Tyre & Industries Ltd says, “FY 2025-26 is likely to play a pivotal role in realizing India’s aspirations. With young India becoming highly mobile, entrepreneurial, and increasingly tech-savvy, the upcoming Union Budget is expected to address their needs by fostering supportive policies and a conducive business environment. Over the last decade, India has demonstrated remarkable progress in physical infrastructure and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), and this momentum is bound to accelerate with a focus on last-mile connectivity and infrastructure development in tier-II and III cities as well beyond. A budget emphasizing infrastructure, sustainable mobility, and industrial competitiveness will not only propel the automotive and allied sectors but also significantly contribute to India’s growth story.""On the other hand, Akash Agarwal, Owner, of Rajasthali Resort & Spa is looking forward to some recognition for the sector amid the developing marketplace of India. He shares, “As we anticipate the Union Budget 2025, it is important to emphasize the significant impact of the travel and tourism sector on India's economy, which currently sustains over 40 million jobs and is expected to exceed 62 million in the next ten years. Our expectations for the budget are high, particularly regarding the recognition of the hospitality sector as an industry, which would improve access to financial resources and support. Moreover, permitting GST credits for hotel construction and investing in a strong international campaign under the Incredible India initiative are critical steps. Additionally, revising the tax on rental income will support the growing homestay sector. It is also vital to tackle the GST issues faced by Online Travel Agents and ensure consistent GST rates for online bookings, creating a more equitable and competitive landscape in the tourism industry.”Further, affordable airfare is at the top of the list for Radhika Khanijo, Founder & Private Travel Designer at Welgrow Travel. He says, “There is undoubtedly going to be a surge in international travel. The number of cross-border trips worldwide is expected to rise gradually until 2025. Travel preferences are evolving, with clients increasingly seeking offbeat destinations. Travelers are adding lesser-known spots to their itineraries, looking for unique experiences beyond traditional travel. Additionally, remote working trends are enabling longer stays, allowing travelers to immerse themselves more deeply in destinations.In Budget 2025, we anticipate airlines to restrict significant increases in airfares. As an outbound travel curator, we hope our authorities will address taxation policies, such as reducing GST and waiving off TCS. These measures would allow us to compete on the same platform as international suppliers and foster the competitive nature of our business.Furthermore, investing in sports facilities can position India as a hub for international sporting events, significantly boosting outbound sports tourism.”Last but not least, in inputs provided by Vishal Vincent Tony, Managing Director of Ayatana Hospitality, he mentions, “As 2025 approaches, resorts are looking forward to a budget that supports tourism and helps the hospitality industry thrive. Many hope for lower taxes on stays, which would make luxury getaways more affordable for travellers. Better roads and connectivity to remote destinations are also high on the wish list, making it easier for guests to discover hidden gems.”“Sustainability is becoming a big focus for resorts, so tax breaks or incentives for going green, like using solar power or eco-friendly materials, would be a welcome boost. Training programs for hospitality staff would also help resorts deliver even better guest experiences. Resort Brands are looking for more government backing to upgrade their facilities and enhance their offerings. If the budget focuses on making travel easier, greener, and more affordable, 2025 could be an exciting year for the hospitality world,” he concludes.","With the Union Budget 2025 approaching, the anticipation among different sectors is palpable.

Poll Do You Agree with the Proposal to Raise the Income Tax Exemption Limit to Rs 10 Lakh? No Yes

Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present this year’s Union Budget 2025 on February 1, 2025. Like every year, the middle class is looking at the Narendra Modi government to provide income tax relief .RSS-affiliated organisations have presented various proposals during pre-budget discussions with FM Nirmala Sitharaman, including raising tax-free/tax exempt income threshold to Rs 10 lakh, implementing an agriculture-specific package, extending MGNREGA work days to 200, quickening GST refunds , and establishing a thorough manufacturing strategy to address Chinese imports.Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh 's (BMS) representatives, led by Pawan Kumar, presented their recommendations to Sitharaman on Monday.According to an ET report, BMS advocated for extending MGNREGA to ensure 200 workdays per family annually. They additionally requested a dedicated package for sectors requiring substantial labour, including agriculture, plantation, beedi and fisheries.The organisation sought implementation of the 8th Pay Commission, tax exemption up to Rs 10 lakh, and preferred OPS over NPS and UPS.Additional proposals included doubling the gratuity calculation period to 30 days per year from 15 days and removing tax obligations for pensioners.Laghu Udyog Bharati: The organisation representing small and medium enterprises requested faster GST refund processing, introduction of an amnesty programme for minor GST filing errors, and GST rate adjustments.Bhartiya Kisan Sangh: The agricultural group sought GST exemption on farming inputs and periodic increases in PM Kisan Nidhi.

How phones on EMIs unlock access to loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-phones-on-emis-unlock-access-to-loans/articleshow/117538186.cms,"MUMBAI: Mobile phone purchases have become a key channel for individuals in the informal sector to get into the formal credit system . While the Jan Dhan Yojana provided everyone with bank accounts, availability of mobile phones on EMI is providing them with a credit history , opening the doors for other loans.""The key channels for the entry of new-to-credit (NTC) borrowers are consumption-led loans such as mobile phone purchases and purchase of two-wheelers. Mobile purchases have emerged as a dominant channel because everyone needs a phone. This trend is supported by tie-ups between mobile phone manufacturers who have access to the device,"" said Bhavesh Jain, MD & CEO of TransUnion Cibil. However, the current year has seen a moderation in adding new-to-credit customers.In recent years, digital lending has made it possible for consumers to get credit in the form of EMI at point of sale, where the loan agreement is contracted, and payment made to the retailer by a swipe of the debit card. Lenders like Bajaj Finance, HDB Financial Services and many private banks provide this credit. Sometimes the OEM provides an interest subvention enabling no-cost EMIs for the customer. The no-cost EMI has resulted in majority of smartphone sales taking place on credit. In some cases, lenders pass on some of the interest subvention to the customer offering better pricing.Availing a loan, however small, makes it easier to get loans in the future because it generates a credit score . This score is calculated as a combination of factors like credit exposure, utilization, inquiry trend, payment behaviour, current and historical delinquencies, and account status. While the Cibil score is not the sole criteria lenders use, most of them take its assistance for assessing loan eligibility.According to Jain, enrolling new-to-credit borrowers works for lenders because, besides expanding the market, it is also a good strategy for customer loyalty. ""Our data shows that over 40% of first-time borrowers return to the same creditor for a second loan in the future,"" said Jain.","Mobile phone purchases have become a key channel for individuals in the informal sector to get into the formal credit system.

It categorically mentioned that the projects were still on amid US indictment.""Reports that Adani’s 484 MW wind power projects in Mannar and Pooneryn have been cancelled are false and misleading. We categorically state that the project has not been cancelled,"" Adani Group said in a statement.This came after AFP reported citing Sri Lankan energy ministry sources that the island nation had revoked the energy deal with the billionaire group.""The government has revoked the power purchase agreement , but the project is not cancelled. A committee has been appointed to review the entire project,"" the source told AFP.Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's administration has launched investigations into Adani Group's local projects following bribery charges against founder Gautam Adani in the United States late last year.The previous administration had agreed in May 2024 to purchase electricity at $0.0826 per kilowatt-hour from an Adani wind power project planned for the island's northwest. However, a senior energy ministry official confirmed that Dissanayake's cabinet has decided this month to halt the deal, AFP reported.Meanwhile, the Adani Group said that the country's recent move to reassess the tariff approved in May 2024 was a routine part of the review process, especially under new government.""The Sri Lankan Cabinet’s decision of 2 Jan 2025 to reevaluate the tariff approved in May 2024 is part of a standard review process, particularly with a new government, to ensure that the terms align with their current priorities and energy policies.

This follows Tatas' earlier acquisition of Wistron's India operations in Karnataka in March 2024.The financial details of the stake acquisition remain undisclosed. This transaction positions Tata Electronics as a major Apple supplier alongside Foxconn, another Taiwanese manufacturer.On Jan 7, the Competition Commission of India said it has approved Tata Electronics' proposed purchase of a majority stake in Pegatron Technology India and its 100% arm TEL Components' proposed business transfer to the Indian unit. CCI further said TEL Components is establishing a greenfield facility for smartphone electronics manufacturing.Pegatron Technology India contributes approximately 10% of iPhone production in India through its Chennai facility, which has a yearly capacity of five million iPhones and employs about 10,000 people. The facility exports electronic products to Apple's operations across North America, Asia and Europe, while serving the Indian market.Tata Electronics and Pegatron Technology India will collaborate to merge their teams, according to a Friday statement from the Tata Sons-owned company. PTI will undergo rebranding to reflect its new ownership structure. Previously, the company renamed Wistron Infocomm Manufacturing (India) to Tata Electronics Systems Solutions.The negotiations between Tata Group and Pegatron had extended over several quarters as the latter sought a local partner due to slim profit margins and workforce management challenges. Notably, Wistron, an early Apple supplier in India, had experienced worker unrest at its facility in late 2020, resulting in property damage and attacks on senior executives' offices.Tata Electronics is negotiating with Chinese smartphone manufacturers - Xiaomi and Oppo - to produce components, aiming to diversify beyond Apple and develop a business model similar to Foxconn's. Tata Group initiated its ventures into electronic and semiconductor manufacturing (under Tata Electronics), healthcare (Tata Medical & Diagnostics) and battery manufacturing (Agratas) during Covid, responding to pandemic-related disruptions in human lives and supply chains.

For legacy organisations, the stakes are higher - they need to pitch their brands to young, tech-savvy consumers alongside fending off competition in a market where a spate of digital native brands are reaching customers at the tap of their smartphones.Godrej Enterprises Group (GEG), which is raising the bets on its consumer-facing businesses - the segment already contributes 60% to the group's revenues and the pie could get bigger given the market opportunity, is spending on digital and AI to strategise better. Following the Godrej family's split last year, GEG is sort of going through an internal overhaul - the group refreshed its brand identity and is now undergoing a digital transformation steered by executive director Nyrika Holkar .""Volatility is a part of life. Having enough information and being cognisant of early warning signs is I think the best that we can do to stay abreast. There's a huge market opportunity in India and of course a lot more competition and that's where the idea of being equipped with enough information to be able to design effectively for the customer (comes in),"" Holkar told TOI in an exclusive interview.The way consumers transact is changing in a digital world and user insights cannot be derived by means of a survey or a set of questions, methods that have been used traditionally.""We have four consumer-facing businesses, all of which might interact with the same customer but the information was very siloed which didn't allows us to holistically understand the customer. The main rationale (of the digital transformation) would be access to information and being able to sift through that to get the right insights to act on,"" Holkar said, adding that the group would be open to making acquisitions to bolster its tech capabilities and gain access to a new market.The group has allotted Rs 1,200 crore (will be spread across three years) towards digital transformation. GEG houses the unlisted Godrej & Boyce and its affiliates spread across sectors ranging from consumer to aerospace. The other faction Godrej Industries Group controls the listed entities. The family split was just a realignment of personal shareholding and the companies which were always independently managed weren't impacted, Holkar said.GEG has been reshuffling its consumer portfolio to focus more on premium offerings, a bet which paid off and helped cushion the impact of inflation which has hurt consumer spending. ""Inflation is impacting the mass segment more. On the commodity front, it's about containing our costs,"" Holkar said.","Godrej Enterprises Group (GEG) is spending on digital and AI to strategise better.

We will continue to invest in our offerings, including Heineken 0.0''.Mirroring the premiumisation trend, the beer market in India witnessed around 6.5% volume and 7.4% value growth in 2024, Giri added. Premium beers are growing at more than double the rate of overall beer sales, which are expanding at a healthy single-digit pace. Additionally, flavours are popular among Gen Z and younger consumers, with the segment anticipated to see significant growth.According to the International Wine and Spirits Record (IWSR), the global beverage alcohol market is expected to begin its recovery in 2025, following declines in 2023 and continued challenges in 2024. India, China and the US will be key value growth drivers, adding $30 billion in incremental value by 2028. Strong growth across no-alcohol categories has continued throughout 2024","Low-alcohol and no-alcohol beers are steadily gaining traction as Gen Z and millennial consumers, along with a growing focus on health, drive a dramatic shift in the beer market. While the numbers remain small, with only a few companies currently leading the charge, industry watchers say the category is gaining traction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117539139,imgsize-1245853,width-400,resizemode-4/117539139.jpg"

Veer Gatha 4.0



NEW DELHI: Republic Day, commemorated each year on January 26, is one of India’s most significant national celebrations. The occasion marks the historic implementation of the Indian Constitution in 1950, establishing the nation as a republic.India's journey to becoming a republic began during British colonial rule. While independence arrived on August 15, 1947, the nation initially operated under British legislation. The country needed its own legal framework that would embody its democratic principles and diverse heritage.After extensive deliberations, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Indian Constitution on November 26, 1949. However, its implementation occurred on January 26, 1950, marking India's official transformation into a republic. Since that momentous day, January 26 has been observed as Republic Day, commemorating India's sovereign status.The selection of January 26 holds profound historical importance. On this date in 1930, under Jawaharlal Nehru's leadership, the Indian National Congress proclaimed ""Purna Swaraj"". Though independence was still years away, this declaration became a crucial milestone in India's independence movement. The date was deliberately chosen for implementing the Constitution, creating a meaningful link between the freedom struggle and India's republican identity.As India prepares to observe its 76th Republic Day, the celebrations will display the nation's diverse cultural legacy, defence capabilities, and progress in technology.Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto will be the chief guest at the parade. Briefing media in New Delhi, defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh stated that a 160-member marching contingent and 190-member band contingent from Indonesia will take part in the Parade at Kartavya Path on January 26, 2025 along with the contingents of Indian Armed Forces.This year, 31 tableaux from various States, Union Territories, and Central Government Ministries/Departments will participate, showcasing the theme “Swarnim Bharat: Virasat aur Vikas.” After the National Anthem, balloons with banners of the official logo of the 75th year of the Indian Constitution will be released. The event will conclude with a flypast by 47 aircraft.The Republic Day Parade will commence at 10:00 AM at Kartavya Path, formerly known as Rajpath, with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi laying a wreath at the National War Memorial.The President will arrive at Kartavya Path in a ceremonial buggy and take the salute during a ceremonial march past, which will include units from the Armed Forces, Para Military Forces, Auxiliary Civil Forces, NCC, and NSS.Despite advance notification of prohibited items, cloakroom facilities will be available for visitors' convenience. The organisers have increased toilet facilities by approximately 100% for visitor convenience, and first aid stations will be positioned outside entry point.Republic Day Parade will be heralded by 300 Cultural artists playing ‘Sare Jahan Se Achha’ musical instruments of different parts of the country. An indigenous mix of instruments that resonate with the melody, beat and hopes of a billion hearts of Indians. Ensemble of instruments includes a wide mix of wind and percussion instruments, like Shehnai, Sundari, Nadaswaram, Been, Mashak Been, Ransingha – Rajasthan, Flute, Karadi Majalu, Mohuri, Sankha, Tutari, Dhol, Gong, Nishan, Chang, Tasha, Sambal, Chenda, Idakka, Lezim, Thavil, Gudum Baza, Talam, Monbah etc.At the 90-minute parade down the majestic Kartavya Path on Jan 26, a marching contingent and band from the country will also take part in the annual celebration. In all, there will be 18 marching contingents, 15 bands and 31 tableaux.Around 10,000 “special guests” have been invited to the parade this year to ensure “Jan Bhagidari”, which include “best performers” in various fields and those “who have made the best use” of various govt schemes.India’s two main indigenous aviation showpieces, Tejas fighter jets and Dhruv advanced light helicopters (ALHs), however, will not be part of the Republic Day fly-past this year, as was earlier reported by TOI.“The grounding of the ALH fleet (there are 330 such choppers in the armed forces) is a slight setback. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is currently conducting safety checks, and it will be sorted out soon. However, it is unlikely the fleet will return to action in time for the parade,” Singh said.With the broad theme of ‘’, tableaux of 16 States/Union Territories (UTs) and 10 Ministries/Departments of the Union Government will be showcased during the 76th Republic Day Parade at Kartavya Path, New Delhi on January, 26, 2025. These tableaux would showcase India’s diverse strengths and its constantly-evolving cultural inclusiveness marching into a glorious future.States like Goa is coming up with the ""cultural heritage of Goa"" theme, Jharkhand: Swarnim Jharkhand: A Legacy of Heritage and Progress, and Uttar Pradesh with "" Mahakumbh 2025 - Swarnim Bharat Virasat aur Vikas"" theme.The third edition of Project Veer Gatha was organized as a part of Republic Day Celebrations-2025 to inspire and spread awareness among children about the gallant deeds and sacrifices of the Armed Forces. The event was organised by Ministry of Defence in collaboration with Ministry of Education during 16 September to 31 October, 2024. A total of approx. 1.76 Cr students have participated at pan India and a total of 100 school students have been declared winners of the Veer Gatha 4.0. These winners will be felicitated by Raksha Mantri and Minister of Education at a ceremony in New Delhi on 25th January. They shall also attend the Republic Day Parade at Kartavya Path.","Republic Day, commemorated each year on January 26, is one of India’s most significant national celebrations.

While making bulk payments, the amount remained with the gateways for a day or two, during which ED had frozen around Rs 500 crore.The agency is investigating the money trail and also checking if the payment gateways had generated suspicious transaction reports (STR), and alerted the RBI and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). All financial institutions have to generate STRs and report them to the RBI periodically, which forwards them to the FIU for enforcement agencies to investigate further. Of the total Rs 497 crore frozen in the virtual accounts of payment gateways, PayU had highest at Rs 130 crore of the alleged 'proceeds of crime' related to the HPZ Token scam, followed by Rs 33.4 crore with Easebuzz, Rs 18 crore with Razorpay, Rs 10.6 crore with CashFree and Rs 2.8 crore with Paytm, a senior official said. The other payment gateways where ED has frozen the alleged scam money, include WunderBaked, AgreePay and SpeedPay.The accused ran a pan-India operation with companies incorporated in at least 20 states, where people were given the option to invest in the mining of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoins, through mobile app HPZ Token. More than 50 companies were registered in Delhi having 84 bank accounts, 26 firms in Karnataka with 37 bank accounts, 19 in Haryana and 11 in UP, besides Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.In this case, a PMLA court in Nagaland on Jan 22 declared a Delhi resident, Bhupesh Arora, as a fugitive economic offender as he refused to appear before the agency despite a non-bailable warrant against him.

Donald Trump signs executive order to end U.S. birthright citizenship

(*Names changed to protect identities)

HYDERABAD: In the weeks leading up to President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan 20, several Indian students in the US engaged in odd jobs post college hours — to earn some extra bucks —have quit their work for fear of deportation. Speaking to TOI some of these students said that while such jobs are crucial to stay afloat in the US, they cannot risk their future especially given the hefty loans they have secured to land a seat at an American college.The US regulation allows international students on F-1 visas to work up to 20 hours a week on-campus. However, many students often turn to off-campus and undocumented work at restaurants, gas stations, or retail stores to cover rent, groceries, and other living costs. Now, with the new administration hinting at tightening the noose around immigration policies and enforcing stricter rules students are giving them up, unwilling to jeopardise their future.Also read: Rush for preterm babies to beat birthright citizenship deadline ""I used to work in a small café after my college hours to cover my monthly expenses.

I can't take any chances, especially after borrowing $50,000 (Rs 42.5 lakh approx.) to study here,"" he added.Neha*, a master's student in New York, aired similar concerns. ""We've heard talk about random checks at workplaces. So, my friends and I have decided to stop working for now. It's hard, but we don't want to risk deportation or losing our student visa status. My parents have already sacrificed too much to send me here.""Also read: First lawsuit filed in US district court contesting end to citizenship by birth The young student from Hyderabad was also working at a eatery for $8 a hour.Students said that they will reassess the situation after a few months and then decide whether to resume work or not.In the meantime, they are relying on their savings or borrowing from friends and families back home in India to make ends meet. ""But it is not a sustainable solution,"" said Rohan Srikanth* studying computer science in Texas. ""I have already used up most of my savings and have started borrowing small amounts from my roommate. I don't know how long I can go on like this.""Rohan said that he is uncomfortable turning to his parents for help because they are already stretched thin. ""I feel guilty asking them for money. But maybe I have to do that soon, as I see no other option right now,"" he said.The uncertainty has also sparked mental health concerns, with some students feeling overwhelmed by the financial and emotional strain.","Several Indian students in the US engaged in odd jobs post college hours — to earn some extra bucks —have quit their work for fear of deportation.

Donald Trump signs executive order to end U.S. birthright citizenship

A federal judge in Seattle has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship , labelling the move as ""blatantly unconstitutional.""US District Judge John Coughenour made the ruling during a hearing on Thursday, saying that the order was a clear violation of the Constitution. His comments came as part of an ongoing legal challenge brought by several states, including Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington, who argue the executive action is unlawful.The case represents the first legal challenge to the controversial order, which Trump signed on Inauguration Day, and was slated to take effect on February 19. The lawsuit, which involves 22 states and immigrant rights groups, includes testimony from several US citizens, some born under the 14th Amendment ’s guarantee of birthright citizenship.Reacting to the court ruling, Trump said that we will 'obviously' appeal the decision.Also read: What is birthright citizenship? During the hearing, Judge Coughenour, appointed by Ronald Reagan, questioned the Justice Department’s lawyer, Brett Shumate, about the legal grounds for the order. When Shumate requested more time to argue his case, Coughenour asserted that the hearing was the appropriate venue to make his arguments.The lawsuit challenging the executive order contends that it undermines the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which has guaranteed citizenship for anyone born on US soil for over a century. This principle, known as jus soli, is a cornerstone of American immigration policy. In his ruling, Coughenour emphasized that the order contradicted the established legal framework and said he could not recall another case where the action in question was so evidently unconstitutional.Trump's order seeks to limit birthright citizenship to children born in the US to parents who are citizens or lawful permanent residents, excluding those born to undocumented immigrants or individuals on temporary visas. The executive action could impact hundreds of thousands of children born in the US each year to non-citizen parents, with estimates suggesting that over 250,000 children could be affected annually.The Justice Department argued that no harm had yet been caused by the order, and that it only applied to births after the scheduled implementation date. However, Coughenour’s ruling places a temporary hold on the order, reflecting concerns that it violates constitutional protections.","A federal judge in Seattle has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship.

Kazuo Ueda, set to speak to reporters later in the day, repeatedly indicated the move was coming. Recent price data show inflation hovering at about the central bank's 2% target.Government data released hours before the decision showed consumer prices, excluding volatile food prices, rose last year at an average rate of 2.5%, marking the third straight year of increase. The consumer price index, excluding food, for the month of December alone showed a 3% rise.Another long-term concern was wage growth. Recent data show Japanese workers are gaining better wages and are generally set to receive solid pay raises in their upcoming annual union negotiations.The labor ministry adjusted its wage data for November to a rise of 0.5%, instead of a decline, helping to support the Bank of Japan's decision.The central bank has signaled that more interest rate raises may be coming, while stressing it plans to be extremely cautious to ensure the economy holds steady.Share prices fell after the announcement, as the value of the Japanese yen gained against the US dollar. A rate rise in July last year sent stock prices tumbling. The bank is also watching for market reactions to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.The Bank of Japan increased the rate for the first time in 17 years in March last year, ending its negative interest rate policy, which amounts to negative borrowing rates.Japan's longtime ultra-lax monetary policy was meant to wrest the economy out of deflationary tendencies and boost growth. Deflation stagnates growth, as companies invest less, cut back on wages and people hold back on spending.Japan's stance is at odds with the loosening trends adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have been cutting rates after raising them to clamp down on inflation.

I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,” Trump told journalists in the Oval Office.“If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 — we’ll up it for all the inflation — I think I’d probably go.”During his first term, Trump broke tradition by making Saudi Arabia, rather than the UK, his first international destination in 2017.The visit also highlighted close relations with the supreme leaders of oil rich Gulf states and presence of his real estate empire across the regions.The public run Saudi Press Agency, stated that the investment was discussed during a telephonic conversation between Trump and the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom.“The crown prince affirmed the kingdom’s intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,” the report stated.However, it did not specify the details of the investment.In recent years, the US has drawn away from reliance on Saudi’s oil exports which had been the foundation of their close ties for decades.At present, Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well.The White House did not comment on the call.The crown prince also spoke with US secretary of state Marco Rubio.Trump maintained close ties with Saudi Arabia, even after the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, which was linked to the crown prince.",Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday announced that he is looking forward to investing a staggering $600 billion in the United States in the upcoming four years.

After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines. The recent launch of a spectacularly successful meme coin helped SOL reach its all-time high yet again. Speculators predict further growth, but several challengers are rising fast.For one, a new TON-based token has the potential to rival this success. Thanks to its significant utility and systemic importance, this token could be a top performer this cycle.After a major rally at the start of the bull market, Solana (SOL) is once again in the headlines. The “Ethereum killer” has attained new highs thanks to a major memecoin launch. Namely, just days before his inauguration, President Donald Trump launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) token. The token quickly attained a staggering valuation of $10 billion, making Trump one of the richest men alive.The token’s launch on Solana has created a market frenzy, pushing Solana to its new ATH at $290. Despite the subsequent volatility, Solana is still up 42% over the past seven days, trading at $254. Now, experts predict that the token can go even higher.The launch of Trump and Melania tokens on the network will likely boost its credibility. At the same time, Trump’s favourable stance toward crypto may prove to be even more consequential. If Solana cements its position as the meme coin hub, it has further potential to expand.Despite Solana’s significant growth, it is not without its challenges. Among them is TON , another high-performance blockchain with several aces up its sleeve. For one, TON has a deep connection with the Telegram messaging app.Telegram provides TON with access to its 950 million users. At the same time, it also enables real-world applications for the network. For one, TON-based apps are becoming more popular on Telegram. For example, popular clicker apps like Notcoin drew significant engagement.TON is also expanding into several new areas. Just in time for the next meme coin rally, TON has revealed a major partnership. Ethereum-based GraFun memecoin launchpad has recently joined the TON platform. This platform will enable the easy creation of meme coins on TON, just as Pump.fun did for Solana.Thanks to these developments, TON emerges as a potential Solana challenger. Moreover, the recent launch of Elluminex (ELX) could further boost its potential. The project aims to be the main trading hub for TON, injecting much-needed liquidity into the chain.Elluminex works as a DEX with cross-chain bridges to 40 major blockchains. This way, it helps bring together liquidity across major chains. This is crucial, as the introduction of major DEXs has had a significant impact on token prices.For instance, since the launch of Raydium, Solana grew from $1.5 to more than $200 in a single year. Ethereum saw similar effects after the launch of Uniswap, as did BNB with PancakeSwap. These examples showcase the importance of liquidity for the chains.Elluminex will also enable low-slippage trading with self-custody, appealing both to large traders and retail players. Thanks to the fact that the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to more than rival Solana’s performance.","After a significant rally, Solana is once again making headlines.

With a startling $190 trillion worth, the global payments sector is about to undergo a significant change as one viral altcoin is causing waves. The promising project Remittix ( RTX ), which combines blockchain technology with local payment networks, is addressing ongoing cross-border problems like sluggish processing times and excessive costs.But should Cardano (ADA) exhibit indications of a possible recovery, could this fresh rival challenge other top crypto coins and flip ADA's position? Remittix might be the crypto initiative that changes our perspective on cross-border transactions this year. Read on to find out why RTX has the potential to surpass ADA.Rising momentum makes Cardano (ADA) among the top altcoins to keep an eye on this year. Though there were occasional swings, the Cardano price increased more than 16% during the past week, showing a bullish momentum. At first, the Cardano price chart showed a bullish trend with higher highs and higher lows. But a brief bearish breakout saw the altcoin drop to $0.98 before rebounding with great positive momentum, moving it to the $1.09 resistance zone.The Cardano price has been steadily rising over the previous month, rising by more than 16% and keeping a good view among the crypto community. Though it still stands over 65% behind its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10, hope regarding a possible ATH retest in 2025 keeps rising. Reflecting a good blend of stability and growth, Cardano (ADA) noted green days in 53% of the last 30 days.Cardano (ADA) is still among the promising altcoins to watch given its strong fundamentals and bullish investor sentiment. Reiterating the positive sentiment shown on the Cardano price chart, indicators including the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages flash buy signals However, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) currently shows sale signals, indicating a possible pullback. Looking forward, analysts are bullish on Cardano (ADA) in 2025. A recent 2025 Cardano price prediction forecasts that the altcoin could trade in a price channel between $1 and $5 on average this year.Remittix is emerging as a promising project at a time when cross-border transactions are sometimes hampered by hefty fees and delayed processing periods. Moreover, Remittix provides a more affordable, efficient means for individuals and companies to transmit money all around the world by merging local payment systems with blockchain technology, therefore bridging cryptocurrencies and traditional banks.The desire for creative ideas like Remittix has never been stronger since the worldwide remittance market exceeds $750 billion yearly. Among the best crypto investment prospects, Remittix is likely to take a sizable chunk of this fast-growing industry. Meanwhile, Remittix distinguishes itself from conventional financial systems by offering low fees and being transparent.Furthermore, Remittix guarantees users know exactly what they will pay upfront, unlike traditional banking systems loaded with hidden costs, excessive fees, and long delays. Remittix has addressed one of the most enduring issues in global payments by supporting more than forty cryptocurrencies and giving users the option to convert them to fiat and forward them to any bank account anywhere in the world.Remittix is well suited to profit from the rising need for quick, safe, competitively cost cross-border payment solutions. Investors are quite interested in the platform since its presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 252 million RTX tokens in a few weeks. Early buyers have a unique chance to join the presale at a shockingly low price of just $0.0256 per RTX token before the expected launch on tier-1 exchanges in the coming weeks.Remittix (RTX) is fast establishing itself as a game-changer in cross-border payments as the competition for dominance in the crypto arena gets more intense. Moreover, Remittix promises faster, less expensive, and more transparent solutions than conventional banking systems.Additionally, Remittix is a project worth investing in given an increasing presale success and a great chance to take a sizable portion of the $750 billion remittance market. Even though Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting indications of recovery, it is evident that the massive investor demand for the limited RTX token supply is poised to result in exponential gains shortly.Join the Remittix (RTX) presale and community:","Remittix (RTX) is transforming cross-border transactions.

He expressed his support for legal immigration, stating that the country would need more workers to support manufacturing growth due to his tariff policies.""I'm fine with legal immigration. I like it. We need people, and I'm absolutely fine with it.

Time to speak openly and plainly

Global Shapers

and decisions about the future

Looking for solutions and social accountability

The protest is small but loud. As limousines drive past, a few hundred young people have gathered on the Postplatz square in Davos, Switzerland.The high-altitude resort in the Alps that usually belongs to skiers looks different this week. Bakeries, cafes, and boutiques have been converted to host banks, companies, or whole countries for the next few days.A pub is now called ""Belgium House."" The old furniture has been cleared out and chic designer furniture and large advertising posters have been put in their place.The demonstrators outside shout ""Eat the rich"" and ""Tax the rich."" Some of them block the street. Their protest is directed at the participants of the World Economic Forum (WEF). They see the meeting, which runs from January 20-24, as a complete waste of money and time.""We are protesting against the lobby meeting of the rich and powerful in Davos. It is clear that they are the ones responsible for the current crises,"" says Mirjam Hostetmann from the youth organization Young Socialists Switzerland, which is connected to the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. The group is helping organize the demonstration under the motto ""Strike WEF.""Ines Yabar has a slightly different view of the event.The young Peruvian was invited as a guest to the World Economic Forum this year. In Lima, she works with others to protect the environment, addresses social problems, and is active as a Global Shaper. This global network of young, committed people between the ages of 20 and 30 is supported by the WEF but organizes itself independently.In Davos, Yabar wants to discuss things with those in power and build bridges, but she also plans to speak plainly. At the same time, she can understand why there are demonstrations outside.""I feel that this shows that young people care and wherever we can we will be protesting because it is important to raise our voice about issues we are passionate about,"" says Yabar. ""But we will also be in rooms where we can talk with people deliberately and intentionally that are making decisions that affect our future.""This year, 50 Global Shapers from around the world will take part in the discussions in Davos.They will discuss social justice , climate change, artificial intelligence (AI) and many other important topics.Being present in Davos is an opportunity for many, especially since many young people are dissatisfied. The current situation cannot continue, says Olajumoke Adekeye.The Nigerian member of the Global Shapers Community is appalled because only 2.8% of the world's parliamentarians are under the age of 30, she says. In sub-Saharan Africa, a large proportion of the population is under 25, but when it comes to decisions that affect their future, they are not heard. And that's why she is here.Indeed, for the next few days her schedule is full. She will need all her energy to meet her mandate of ""seeding ideas about how young people can be empowered to take on greater responsibility.""""Together both the youth within these walls and outside send a strong message that there is really change that can be made,"" says Adekeye, when asked about being a part of a youth delegation inside the WEF while young people protested outside.Akshay Saxena from India also believes in the power of the young and is looking for change.""Too many decisions for the majority are made by a very small group of people,"" he says.He supports young talent through the organization Avanti Fellows where he is co-CEO. They focus on children from poor families who have little access to the education system.""There are so many bright kids, exceptional people, their talent is often wasted,"" he muses. For his work, Saxena is being honored as the Social Entrepreneur of the Year at this year's WEF meeting.""If capitalism is going to work, it is critical that people who own a lot, share some of their wealth. That is their social responsibility,"" he says.Around 70,000 young Indians have taken part in Avanti Fellows' online courses on mathematics, technology, and various science subjects. Others receive targeted support in schools through the organization's programs.Saxena proudly reports on participants who graduated from the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US after receiving funding. ""My approach is solution-based,"" he says, pulling a blanket closer to keep himself warm.His gaze wanders over the Swiss mountains. ""Problems should be solved by people who are most affected,"" says Saxena, reflecting on the issues at hand. ""There is certainly a truth in this.""","Young people are protesting outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They see the meeting as a complete waste of money and time.

Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses due to heightened rivalry from Amazon and Temu.Wesfarmers , which acquired the online retailer for $230million in 2019, issued a closure announcement on Tuesday.According to a Daily Mail report, the company expects an operational deficit reaching $40million in the initial half of 2024-25.“While Catch's financial performance has been challenging, we have gained valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the group's digital transformation and supported the development of the OnePass membership program,” Daily Mail quoted Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott as saying.The company cited intense rivalry from international online retailers such as Temu, Shein, and Amazon.“The recent increase in competitive intensity in the Australian e-commerce sector has affected Catch's financial performance and growth prospects,” according to the announcement.Whilst 100 positions will be preserved and transferred to other Wesfarmers subsidiaries like Kmart, 190 positions will be eliminated.The logistics centres will transition to Kmart's control during the final quarter of 2024-25.Kmart Group Managing Director Ian Bailey indicated the arrangement would enhance customer service through access to Catch's Moorebank warehouse in Sydney's south-west.“Kmart Group can better utilise Catch's fulfilment centres, which are currently less than 50 per cent utilised. The transition will result in faster deliveries to customers at a lower unit cost, while relieving pressure on our busy stores,” he explained.Established by Gabby and Hezi Leibovich as Catch of the Day in 2006, the business gained popularity amongst value-conscious Australian shoppers but ultimately struggled against competitors who faced fewer operational costs and taxes.","Australian e-commerce platform Catch is looking to shut down, resulting in approximately 200 job losses.

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%. Oxfam says colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117388573,imgsize-410043,width-400,resizemode-4/117388573.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

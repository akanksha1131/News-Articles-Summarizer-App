India-US Trade Deal Vs India-EU FTA: Which Agreement Delivers Bigger Exports Jobs And Growth

India's trade surplus with the United States could exceed $90 billion annually, according to a new report by SBI. This growth has been driven by rising exports and higher import potential.Indian exporters could boost their top 15 items' exports to the US by $97 billion yearly, with total exports potentially crossing $100 billion annually after recent tariff reductions.""India's Trade surplus with the US may thus cross USD 90 bn annually.......As per our preliminary estimates, Indian exporters may increase their exports of the top 15 items to the US by approx. USD 97 billion in a year,"" the report stated, as cited by ANI. The falling tariffs open up new opportunities for Indian exporters to grab a bigger slice of the US market.The trade surplus is already showing strong signs of growth. It reached $40.9 billion in FY25 and $26 billion in FY26 (April-December). The extra export push could help push the surplus beyond $90 billion yearly, potentially adding 1.1 per cent to India's GDP.Currently, the US makes up about 20 per cent of India's exports but only 7 per cent of its imports.In services imports, the US share is just 15 per cent. This gap suggests India remains an untapped market for US goods and services.On the import side, India has committed to buying $500 billion worth of US goods over the next five years. The US could potentially export more than $50 billion worth of goods to India yearly, not counting services. Import values could rise by $55 billion as India agrees to cut or remove tariffs on US industrial goods and agricultural products.Some US products already have a strong presence in Indian imports, with shares between 20-40 per cent. For instance, the US supplies 90 per cent of India's almond imports. The tariff cuts could help India save $100-150 million in foreign exchange on these items alone. Total foreign exchange savings from reduced or zero import duties could reach $3 billion, with potential for even more through import substitution.",India's trade surplus with the United States could exceed $90 billion annually.

Tech shares continued to trade in red on Friday, extending losses as fears of disruption from artificial intelligence and fading hopes of an early interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve continued to weigh down investor sentiment.At 9:50 am, the Nifty IT index slumped 4.59%, or 1,520 points, to trade at 31,639, reflecting broad-based weakness across technology counters. Infosys fell 85 points, or 6.13%, to 1,299 on the NSE, while TCS declined 4.77% to 2,619. HCLTech and Wipro dropped 4.48% and 3.64%, respectively, and Tech Mahindra was lower by 2.66%. In the mid-tier space, Coforge tumbled 1,345 points, or 5.32%, Persistent lost 3.16% to 5,279, and LTIMindtree slipped 3.62% to 5,023.This comes just a day after the 10 stock pack Nifty IT index emerged as the worst performing segment on Thursday, plunging close to its lowest level in almost 10 months and continuing to be the weakest sector for this year, so far.In US, American Depository Receipts of Infosys and Wipro retreated sharply, extending losses for a second straight session. Infosys ended down as much as 10% at $14.21 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Wipro shed 5% to finish at $2.28.The weakness follows a brutal outing in the previous trade when the Nifty IT index dived up to 5.5% and several heavyweights cracked as much as 6%, according to ET.Traders expect the pressure to radiate across the wider technology universe, keeping stocks such as Coforge, Persistent Systems, LTIMindtree and HCLTech firmly in focus.The immediate trigger for the latest bout of anxiety has been a new offering from Anthropic, the firm known for the Claude chatbot. Investors see the move as another reminder that AI adoption could intensify rivalry, squeeze profitability and chip away at the competitive strengths traditionally enjoyed by IT services companies, according to ET. Sentiment towards software exporters had already been fragile, and the announcement deepened the caution.According to VK Vijayakumar from Geojit Investments, ""Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon."" According to some market watchers, as much as 40% of revenue could be at risk if automated systems take over work once handled by human employees.Brokerage house Motilal Oswal also flagged risks, arguing that AI may render traditional software development and testing assignments less critical. However, it recommended keeping an eye on potential tie-ups in the coming three to six months that could pave the way for fresh AI-led deals by mid-2026.","The Nifty IT index slumped 4.59%, or 1,520 points, to trade at 31,639.

Gold and silver price prediction:

Gold and silver prices have bounced back from recent lows, and appear to be on path for a long-term rise, believes Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

The commodity expert shares his outlook for gold and silver in the coming sessions:

MCX Gold Price Outlook

MCX Gold Trading Strategy

CMP: 158,500

Target: 175,000

Stop Loss: 148,400

MCX Silver Price Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

On the weekly chart, MCX Gold continues to maintain a bullish bias after rebounding successfully from the trendline support. A decisive break above last week’s high of 160755, which is currently acting as immediate resistance, would further confirm and strengthen the bullish outlook. The recent pickup in momentum highlights the strength and sustainability of the move, and the broader trend remains positive as long as prices stay above the weekly low.For the week ahead, the level of 148,400 should be a key support zone, coinciding with the 30-day exponential moving average and reinforcing its technical significance. Any corrective dip toward this region is likely to attract renewed buying interest, thereby protecting near-term downside pressure. Holding above this limit maintains the broader bullish outline and underlines the existing upward momentum.Gold appears to continue its advance toward the 175,000 level in the upcoming sessions. A firm close ahead of this mark would serve as confirmation of continued bullish strength in the periods ahead. This projected move is consistent with the larger uptrend and reflects solid underlying momentum. Additionally, the consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart reinforces the constructive outlook and signals the potential for a sustained rally.In summary, gold maintains a positive outlook, with the technical framework favouring further upside. Provided prices remain firmly above the critical 148,400 support zone, the bullish structure stays intact. Supported by strong momentum signals and an encouraging sentiment background, the precious metal looks positioned to extend its advance in the sessions ahead.MCX Silver has rebounded from its recent lows, with prices currently testing a key retracement zone and indicating a potential continuation of the broader uptrend. Since the underlying trend remains positive, interim declines may present buying opportunities, provided the previous weekly low continues to hold. Traders are advised to align with the prevalent trend while keeping stop-loss levels placed near the recent weekly lows to manage risk effectively.The strong start to the week reinforces the return of bullish momentum and supports expectations of further gains. The positive outlook remains intact as long as prices trade above the established weekly support levels. Immediate support is positioned near the 226,000 mark; a decisive close below this area could temper the bullish view. Until such a breakdown occurs, corrective dips are likely to invite renewed buying interest, helping to sustain the upward trajectory.On the higher side, silver seems poised to challenge the 315,000 resistance level in the near to medium term. Such a move would reinforce the continuation of the ongoing bullish cycle, supported by solid momentum and constructive technical signals. Overall, as long as prices hold decisively above the 226,000 support zone, the uptrend is likely to remain intact, leaving room for further gains amid strengthening positive sentiment.","Gold and silver prices have bounced back from recent lows, believes Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

NEW DELHI: India’s IT services sector must pivot decisively to stay ahead in the AI era, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday, amid concerns in the sector related to generative AI tools such as Anthropic’s Claude, which recently triggered stock dips in firms like TCS, Infosys and other IT firms.“If we are looking at becoming a major AI player, a major player in the future of tech... we have to reimagine ourselves. There’s no way we can live in the past. We have to quickly reorient, accept the future, adopt it,” Goyal said, adding, “India’s IT industry will continue to thrive despite disruption.”Goyal also said AI should be seen as an enabler rather than a threat. “AI will support us in our world. I’m not worried about job losses. We train, retrain, we reskill. I’m confident we’ll add jobs in this. But if we don’t stay alert and active, then we could start losing,” he said, adding that alongside AI adoption, companies must strengthen cybersecurity and data governance.Goyal urged industry to seize opportunities in cloud, data centres and applied AI rather than worry about long-term large language model development. He called for attracting global investments into India instead of sending talent overseas. “Bring investments to India, create jobs here, skill our people and keep that talent here… we’ll create some IP here.”","India’s IT services sector must pivot decisively to stay ahead in the AI era, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday.

‘New series may make inflation less volatile’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-series-may-make-inflation-less-volatile/articleshow/128287209.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Lower weightage of food and beverages in new consumer price inflation (CPI) series may make overall inflation less volatile, leading to monetary policy response to be more focused on aggregate demand pressure, rather than dealing with supply-induced inflation, chief economic advisor (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran said Thursday. This will help calibrating monetary and fiscal policy better as updated data reflects current consumption patterns and economic conditions, he added.Highlighting the policy implications of new inflation series, the CEA indicated that lower volatility may lead to better predictability of govt’s Budget and also help assess inflation expectations in households and businesses.“New CPI series now provides policy makers with a more up-to-date basis for assessing real incomes, consumption trends and purchasing power,” said Nageswaran.The weightage of volatile food and beverages items in the new series has been reduced to about 37% from 46% earlier, which according to Nageswaran reflects a progressive diversification of expenditure towards health, education, mobility and connectivity.“The revised basket also highlights increasing role of services in consumption. This brings consumption measurement closer to the evolving structure of output and employment, where services account for a rising share of economic activity and the new series also recognises the growing role of digital channels in price formation.”The CEA also said the new CPI series captures housing costs more accurately, leading to better measurement of the rural cost of living, reducing urban bias in inflation estimation. “So, poverty estimates become more accurate since real consumption and real income calculations depend directly on CPI. Improved cost of living measurement enhances targeting efficiency of welfare schemes, ensuring benefits, subsidies are better aligned with actual regional price realities. ”",Lower weightage of food and beverages in new consumer price inflation (CPI) series may make overall inflation less volatile.

CLSA has an outperform rating on M&M with the target price raised to Rs 4,702. Analysts said the company remains a revenue market leader in utility vehicles. With a strong launch pipeline, its superior execution capability and improving profitability, expect M&M to deliver 20% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over FY26-FY28.

The company is likely to emerge as a major beneficiary of a pickup in CV demand. Over the years, the company has effectively reduced its business cyclicality by focusing on non-truck segments. Analysts also said that the company's continued emphasis on margin expansion and its prudent control of capex are likely to help improve returns in the long run.

MUMBAI: A mix of low food inflation and GST cuts have put more money into the hands of people, aiding demand for consumer goods, FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever (HUL) said on Thursday. It projected FY27 growth to be better than FY26 even as the firm cautioned that input costs remain volatile due to a depreciating rupee and divergent commodity trends.Helped by favourable macro trends and improved consumer sentiment following months of sluggish growth, HUL’s strategy will be to shore up sales volumes.“We are obsessed with volume-led revenue growth,” CEO & MD Priya Nair said in a post-earnings briefing here, adding that rural consumption continues to grow ahead of urban. The per capita consumption in rural areas is much lower, leaving room for higher growth, Nair said. “But we see both urban and rural growth to be stable and firm,” she added.HUL’s revenue from operations increased to Rs 15,805 crore on a standalone basis in the Dec quarter, translating into a year-onyear growth of 4.3%. Net profits jumped to Rs 7,075 crore in Q3FY26 from Rs 3,001 crore in the year-ago period on the back of a oneoff gain arising from the demerger of its ice cream business.Profit after tax befo-re exceptional items from continuing operations for the quarter however, grew by a mere 1% to Rs 2,570 crore due to impact of the labour codes.In Q3, HUL incurred a one-time gratuity impact due to labour codes amounting to Rs 110 crore, said new CFO Niranjan Gupta. The company delivered a 5% underlying sales growth and a 4% underlying volume growth in the quarter. HUL results, however, failed to cheer the street with the stock price ending at Rs 2,410 apiece on the BSE, down 2.1%.“Our broad-based growth in the current quarter reflects gradual momentum across our portfolio. Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain conducive for a sustained recovery in consumption,” said Gupta in his first earnings call after assuming office in November.Consumption gains from GST cuts on a host of essentials which kicked in last Sept will play out in the long term, alongside boosting premiumisation instead of showing up by way of a short-term spike in demand, Gupta said. Under Nair, HUL is doubling down on quick commerce which now accounts for 3% of the firm’s sales, and scaling D2C businesses, betting on emerging growth areas such as health and wellbeing as rise of instant shopping and new age brands change the way India consumes.","HUL’s revenue from operations increased to Rs 15,805 crore on a standalone basis in the Dec quarter, translating into a year-onyear growth of 4.3%.

China EXPLODES At Israel's Invasion Bid After Trump & 8 Muslim Nations | 'Not Your TERRITORY'

China has intensified efforts to cement its dominance over rare earth metals as the United States moves to build a broad international coalition to secure critical mineral supply chains, official and media reports said.Chinese Premier Li Qiang this week visited Ganzhou in Jiangxi province — one of the world’s largest heavy rare earth production bases — underscoring Beijing’s strategic focus on the sector that underpins advanced manufacturing and technology. Li inspected key producers, research institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Ganjiang Innovation Academy, and held talks with local business leaders and scientists, according to Chinese state media Xinhua.South China Morning Post quoted Li as saying, “The value of rare earths in boosting advanced manufacturing and green, low‑carbon transformation is increasingly prominent,” highlighting the role of these metals in high-tech and clean-energy industriesChina currently accounts for around 70 % of global rare earth mining and nearly 90 % of processing capacity, giving it substantial leverage in disputes with the United States and other major economies.Beijing’s tightened export controls last year led to disruptions in supply to the US, the EU, India, and other nations, prompting Washington to accelerate efforts to diversify sources of the minerals, which are essential for electronics, automobiles, wind turbines, and defence equipment.According to news agency PTI, China’s restrictions on rare earth supplies previously forced US President Donald Trump to agree to resume shipments to Washington in exchange for tariff concessions and lifting a semiconductor export ban.In response, the Trump administration this month launched a major initiative to form a metallic alliance with more than 50 nations, including India, aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains and reducing reliance on China. As part of this strategy, the US has unveiled a USD 12 billion stockpile plan dubbed “Project Vault” to finance domestic and allied mining and processing.Li also chaired a State Council meeting to push AI-driven innovation, emphasising the integration of data, computing, electricity, network resources, and hardware-software synergy to strengthen China’s technological edge, South China Morning Post reported.",China has intensified efforts to cement its dominance over rare earth metals.

WTO DG Okonjo-Iweala Lauds India’s Trade Strategy, Calls For Multilateral Leadership

The World Trade Organization (WTO) needs urgent structural reform as the global trading system undergoes rapid economic and technological shifts, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said, warning that maintaining the current framework is no longer viable, AFP reported.Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, Okonjo-Iweala said the global trade body and the broader multilateral system are at a decisive moment. “We are meeting today at an inflection point, not just for the WTO, but... for the multilateral system,” she said, adding that failure to preserve the global trading framework could trigger instability.“I don't think the status quo is an option,” she said.Reform is expected to be a central agenda item at the WTO ministerial meeting scheduled in Cameroon next month.The WTO, which governs large parts of global trade flows, has been facing operational challenges due to its consensus-based decision-making structure and a dispute settlement mechanism that has been weakened amid tensions with the United States. The organisation has also faced growing geopolitical pressures, which intensified after US President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year and trade tensions escalated.Okonjo-Iweala stressed that global institutions must evolve alongside rapid technological and economic transformation. “The world is moving so fast... If you look at the speed at which technology is moving, and AI is moving and quantum technologies are moving,” she said.“If your organisation doesn't adapt, then you'll be left behind,” she added.Highlighting the WTO’s role in providing trade certainty, she said the system continues to remain foundational despite growing challenges. “This organisation provides stability and predictability,” she said, adding that “in spite of all the knocks, it is still the bedrock for so much of world trade”.She cautioned that a breakdown of the multilateral trading framework would create widespread uncertainty for businesses and global commerce.“If we don't have this system, what does it mean? I'll be very honest with you: there'll be chaos,” she said.“It means a business will send goods somewhere without the knowledge of how those goods will be valued when it arrives at customs... you wouldn't know how your goods will be valued before you're tariffed. You wouldn't know whether you're going to make money or not.”“You'll be confronted when your goods arrive with rules that you were never aware of,” she added.",WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala says the global trading system is at an 'inflection point' She warns that a breakdown of the multilateral trading framework would create widespread uncertainty for businesses.

Rate-cut bets strengthen, bond yields fall

Mixed earnings keep stocks in check

Wall Street stocks traded near record levels on Tuesday as investors digested weak US retail sales data and a mixed set of corporate earnings, boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later this year.The S&P 500 was marginally higher, briefly sitting just above its all-time high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose around 0.4 per cent to hover near record territory. The Nasdaq Composite also edged up slightly.According to news agency AFP, markets were largely indecisive early in the session as traders balanced concerns about slowing consumer spending with optimism over possible monetary easing.US retail sales data showed no growth in December, missing economists’ expectations and raising concerns about the momentum of the world’s largest economy.Shoppers spent roughly the same in December as in November, signalling potential weakness in household demand, which is the main engine of US economic growth, as per AP.The softer retail data pushed Treasury yields lower, with the benchmark 10-year yield falling to around 4.13 per cent from 4.22 per cent a day earlier, reported news agency AP.Traders also increased bets that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates three times or more this year, according to CME Group data, though most still expect two cuts.The retail sales report comes ahead of key US data releases later this week, including unemployment figures on Wednesday and inflation numbers on Friday. These updates are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the Fed’s interest rate outlook.While stubborn inflation could keep rates higher for longer, signs of labour market weakness may prompt quicker easing.CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall said the data could strengthen the case for additional rate cuts but warned investors must balance this against “the possibility of an economic slowdown”.Corporate earnings offered a mixed picture. Coca-Cola shares slipped after the company reported quarterly revenue growth that fell short of expectations and issued a cautious outlook.S&P Global tumbled after giving a weaker-than-expected profit forecast, amid concerns about competition from AI-driven rivals.In contrast, Hasbro jumped after beating profit and revenue estimates and announcing plans to return up to $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks.DuPont also gained after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results and issuing an upbeat profit outlook for 2026.Outside the US, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged more than 2 per cent to a fresh record, driven by expectations that a newly elected parliament will support tax cuts and pro-growth measures.Other Asian markets saw modest gains, while European indices traded mixed.Overall, markets remained supported by hopes of lower interest rates, even as investors weighed signs of a cooling US economy against resilient corporate performance.","The S&P 500 was marginally higher, briefly sitting just above its all-time high.

Bangladesh commerce secretary Mahbubur Rahman and assistant US trade representative Brendan Lynch were also present.Speaking on the agreement, Greer said, “Under President Trump's leadership, the United States is pursuing a trade policy that delivers real results for American workers and businesses, strengthening our economic and security partnerships abroad.” He further added, “today's signing of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade with Bangladesh is the first in South Asia and marks a meaningful step forward in opening markets, addressing trade barriers, and creating new opportunities for American exporters. ”Bangladesh's chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said that the agreement indicates a “historically new level” in relations between the two nations.The latest deal also reduces the reciprocal tariff from the initial figure of 37% and the 20% that had been in place since August last year.As part of the deal, Washington has also committed to establish a pathway for certain textile and apparel shipments from Bangladesh made with US cotton and man-made fibre to enter the United States at a zero reciprocal tariff.“The reduction of reciprocal tariff will grant further advantage to our exporters, while zero reciprocal tariff on specific textile and apparel exports from Bangladesh using US inputs will give substantial added impetus to our garments sector”, said NSA Rahman, Bangladesh’s chief negotiator.Dhaka said that the agreement was approved by the council of advisers approved and the pact will come into force once both governments issue formal notifications.","Under the arrangement, Bangladesh’s exports to the American market will face a 19% tariff, slightly below the earlier rate of 20%.

US President Donald Trump sees the US stock market doubling from here by the end of his term. Praising the first year of his second term, Trump expressed confidence that the stock market could double within the next two years after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 50,000 mark for the first time on Friday.Posting on Truth Social during the Super Bowl on Sunday night, Trump attributed the Dow Jones’ milestone to what he believes are strong tariffs and national security policies. He said he expected the Dow to reach 100,000 by the time his term concludes, adding that he hoped the United States Supreme Court was observing developments. This comment is widely being interpreted as a message urging the court not to interfere with his tariff agenda.""Record Stock Market, and National Security, driven by our Great TARIFFS. I am predicting 100,000 on the DOW by the end of my Term.REMEMBER, TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!

He also pointed to an estimated 5.4% expansion in gross domestic product in the previous quarter, despite what he described as a record-long government shutdown driven by Democrats.According to his remarks, the shutdown was carried out under the banner of healthcare reform that ultimately did not materialise, with conservatives claiming it was intended as a political move against him. He further stated that Senate Democrats triggered another shutdown toward the end of last month and could potentially cause another if funding for the Department of Homeland Security is not approved before the February 13 deadline later this week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 50,000 level for the first time on Friday. This marked a historic milestone for the blue-chip index as investors increasingly shifted toward non-technology stocks this year.The index climbed 1,206.95 points, or 2.47%, to settle at 50,115.67 at the close of trading. The strong gain reflects continued momentum in the Dow, which has outperformed other major Wall Street benchmarks so far this year.Market participants have increasingly turned to stocks outside the technology sector, supporting the index’s advance and helping drive its year-to-date rise.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

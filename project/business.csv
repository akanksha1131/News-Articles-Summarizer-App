Will the flow of Russian crude completely stop?

US President Donald Trump’s sanctions on two of Russia’s biggest oil majors - Rosneft and Lukoil - come into effect today - November 21, 2025 which was set as the wind-down deadline by the US Treasury Department. Will the move finally get Trump what he wants - that India stops buying oil from Russia?The Trump administration announced sanctions on Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft) and Lukoil OAO (Lukoil), alleging that their financial contributions support Moscow's military operations in Ukraine. The European Union has also implemented restrictions prohibiting the purchase of petroleum products that are derived from Russian crude oil, which begin from January 2026.Trump has imposed a 25% penal tariff on Indian exports in lieu of its crude oil imports from Russia and this has been an impediment in the ongoing discussions for a trade deal with India. While the tariffs have not deterred India from buying Russia’s crude, the sanctions on Russian oil majors may have the desired effect.Russian crude loadings headed for India have dropped sharply - at ~982 kbd in November till 20th November, according to data from Kpler, a global real-time data and analytics provider. This is the lowest level since October 2022.“While volumes may still shift, as some in-transit vessels could revise their final destinations, the trend is clear: India-bound flows are softening. Loadings have already slowed since 21 October, though it is still early for definitive conclusions given Russia’s agility in deploying intermediaries, shadow fleets, and workaround financing,” says Kpler.According to a Bloomberg report, approximately 48 million barrels of Russian oil could become stranded at sea. This could cause several vessels to urgently seek new delivery locations. This development would mark another significant disruption in international oil trade.Experts are of the view that Trump’s sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil will serve to be an effective measure to get India to diversify away from Russian crude oil imports. As per data, Russia has supplied approximately 34% of India's crude oil this year, of which Rosneft and Lukoil have contributed approximately 60% in volume. With these two Russian oil majors being sanctioned, Indian refiners have little option but to stop procuring from them, at least for export purposes.Kpler predicts that with the November 21 deadline, Indian refiners (except Nayara), will stop direct procurement of crude oil from the sanctioned Russian entities.This is expected to cause a significant reduction in Russian oil deliveries to India, particularly during December and January, it says.According to Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst, Refining and Modelling at Kpler, the recent US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil represent a meaningful escalation and are set to temporarily reshape India’s crude import flows—even if they do not alter New Delhi’s long-term strategy of maintaining diversified, cost-advantaged supply.While shipments have decreased since October 21, it is still premature to draw any conclusions on Russian imports being completely halted since Russia has in the past shown its ability to utilise intermediaries, shadow fleets, and workaround financing.Kpler is of the view that refineries will adopt a more conservative approach, utilising non-sanctioned traders, mixed oil sources, and sophisticated logistics to reduce their exposure to Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulations. “Russian supply will not disappear but will increasingly move through opaque channels,” says Sumit Ritolia of Kpler.At present, the shipping patterns indicate significant changes in Russian oil trading practices, characterised by unexpected route changes between India and China, alongside unusual Ship-to-Ship transfers near Mumbai's coastline, away from conventional transfer points near the Singapore Strait. These developments reflect evolving logistical tactics by Russian exporters navigating tightening Western sanctions, says Kpler.Reliance Industries Ltd, which is the main purchaser of Russian crude oil, has said that it will stop importing from Russia at its export-focused refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat. RIL’s move aligns with the US and EU sanctions.""We have stopped importing Russian crude oil into our SEZ refinery with effect from November 20,"" RIL said on Thursday.RIL’s Jamnagar facility has two distinct units - there is an SEZ refinery that is dedicated to exports for the US, European Union, and other international markets - alongside a conventional unit that refines to serve domestic needs.From December 1, all product exports from the SEZ refinery will be obtained from non-Russian crude oil…The transition has been completed ahead of schedule to ensure full compliance with product-import restrictions coming into force in January 2026,” said RIL.India’s imports of Russian crude went up substantially after the latter offered oil at huge discounts following the start of its war with Ukraine. Before the Russia-Ukraine war, the share of Russian crude in India’s oil import basket was negligible. Since then it has gone up to almost 40%.In the run up to the November 21 wind-down deadline set by the Trump administration, India’s crude imports from Russia are expected to remain very strong — around 1.8–1.9 Mbd — as refiners continue to prioritise the most economical barrels ahead of the sanctions cutoff, says Kpler.After that imports are expected to decrease significantly in the immediate term, as shipments from Rosneft or Lukoil post-November 21 would face higher sanctions exposure and scrutiny.“Based on current understanding, no Indian refiner other than Nayara’s already-sanctioned Vadinar facility is likely to take the risk of dealing with OFAC-designated entities, and buyers will need time to reconfigure contracts, routing, ownership structures, and payment channels,” says Kpler.So what will India do now that Russian oil majors have been sanctioned? Kpler says that India has several options available to meet its needs.Given their sophisticated processing capabilities, Indian refiners can technically manage the replacement of Russian volumes, though this would impact profit margins for some facilities, it says.According to Kpler, Indian refiners are diversifying their crude oil sources to offset the impact of reduced Russian supplies. They are likely to source crude from:Freight costs on long-haul routes will cap substitution potential, but the overall import basket is likely to widen, says Sumit Ritolia.There is also the important point that India can continue to import Russian crude oil from non-sanctioned entities.The current sanctions specifically target Rosneft and Lukoil and their majority-owned subsidiaries, rather than all Russian oil producers.This means that crude supplied by non-designated Russian entities — for example Surgutneftegaz, Gazprom Neft, or independent traders using non-sanctioned intermediaries — can still be legally purchased by Indian refiners, as long as no sanctioned entity, vessel, bank, or service provider is involved, says Kpler.However, there are two significant challenges to that:1. Operational risks increase for all suppliers, including non-sanctioned ones, as OFAC might expand designations, whilst traders, banks, and insurers could reduce their involvement to avoid secondary sanctions.2. Supply volumes may not completely replace Rosneft/Lukoil quantities immediately, given their dominant position in Russia's export infrastructure and blend composition.Whilst non-sanctioned Russian producers can maintain supply chains, they face operational constraints and heightened risks, particularly if Western sanctions intensify or expand beyond currently designated entities.According to Kpler, there's been a noticeable uptick in undisclosed cargoes leaving Russian ports. “Many of these tankers had previously been discharged in India, indicating a potential continuation of flows via less transparent channels,” says Kpler.“However, diversions to other Asian buyers cannot be ruled out. For now, November buying remains fluid, but the drop in declared India-bound volumes aligns with expectations as refiners move cautiously ahead of the 21 November OFAC wind-down deadline,” it says.While the Trump administration and EU’s sanctions are expected to be a temporary jolt for Russian crude trade, its oil is unlikely to completely disappear from the world markets. Russia is an important supplier of oil in the world and its abrupt withdrawal from the market may cause price disruptions.“Despite near-term declines, a complete halt to Russian imports is unlikely. Discounted Russian barrels remain attractive for margins, and India’s energy policy continues to prioritise affordability and security over geopolitical pressure,” notes Kpler’s Sumit Ritolia.“Unless secondary sanctions directly target Indian buyers or New Delhi imposes formal restrictions—both low-probability scenarios—Russian crude will keep flowing to India, though via increasingly diversified and less transparent channels,” he adds.The long-term outlook depends entirely on how strictly the West enforces secondary sanctions and the potential introduction of any additional measures, such as sanctions on all Russian oil or even penalties for refineries that are processing Russian crude. Stricter enforcement would reduce volumes of Russian crude imports further, whilst a lenient implementation may allow for some recovery through intermediary channels.“Russian crude flows are entering a phase of heightened uncertainty and volatility as the supply chain adapts. New trading intermediaries, alternative shipowners, evolving payment mechanisms, STS transfers, and a shift toward “clean” (non-designated) sellers will all shape post-November trade,” says Kpler.“Until refiners gain clarity on compliant pathways — including secure non-sanctioned counterparties, shipping and insurance availability, and workable banking solutions — India’s imports from Russia will remain in choppy waters, marked by short-term disruptions (i.e., lower arrivals) and frequent shifts in sourcing patterns,” concludes Sumit Ritolia.",US President Donald Trump's sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil majors - Rosneft and Lukoil - come into effect today.

Public Provident Fund or PPF is one of the most popular investment options available - and one that can make you a crorepati with disciplined investing. In fact if you were to start a PPF account by the age of 21, you can easily become a crorepati by the age of 46 - way ahead of the conventional retirement age.PPF is a government-backed investment which currently offers an interest rate of 7.1% making it a suitable option for not only risk-averse investors, but also those who are looking at fixed income instruments.Who can open a PPF account and what is the maximum investment limit? Are there any tax benefits of PPF and how long is the lock-in period? Importantly, is PPF the right investment option for you to become a crorepati? How do other investment alternatives compare? Here is a detailed explainer:Any resident Indian can open one PPF account in their own name. Additionally, an individual can open one PPF account on behalf of a minor child or a person with mental illness or intellectual disability, provided they serve as the guardian.However, PPF does not allow for joint accounts. Each minor or dependent is allowed only one account and that too through a guardian.PPF accounts can be opened at post offices, designated banks, and e-banking services.Deposits can be made in one lump sum or in multiple installments.The overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh includes contributions made to your own account as well as any accounts you operate for minors.PPF is a EEE product - making it a preferred option for tax saving investments. EEE products or Exempt, Exempt, Exempt are those instruments where the principal investment, interest, and maturity amount are all tax-free.All PPF contributions qualify for tax deduction under Section 80C. This means that individuals opting for the old income tax regime can avail a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for their PPF investment. While Section 80C benefits are not available under the new income tax regime, the interest earned and the final maturity amount continue to be tax-free.Interest rate on PPF is reviewed quarterly by the Ministry of Finance. For your PPF account, the interest calculation is done monthly on the lowest balance between the 5th and the last day of the month. This interest is credited annually, typically at the end of the financial year.This means that to accrue the maximum benefit of the full Rs 1.5 lakh investment limit for a year, investors should look at a lump sum deposit between April 1-5 of a financial year.You can opt for premature withdrawal after five years from the end of the year in which the account was opened. Account holders may withdraw up to 50% of the balance—calculated based on either the fourth year preceding the withdrawal year or the previous year, whichever is lower.Any outstanding loan must be fully repaid before a withdrawal can be made, and discontinued accounts are not eligible for this facility. You can take a loan against your PPF balance between the 3rd and 6th financial year, up to 25% of the balance from two years prior. The loan must be repaid within 36 months, after which only 1% interest per year is charged — but delays push this to 6%. Only one loan can be taken in a year, and no new loan is allowed until the previous one is fully repaid.Premature closure of a PPF account is permitted only under specific circumstances: life-threatening illness of the account holder or immediate family, higher education needs of the account holder or dependent children, or a change in residency status to NRI.In such cases, the account earns interest at a rate 1% lower than originally credited over time. In the event of the account holder’s death, the PPF account must be closed; the nominee or legal heir cannot continue it, although interest is payable until the end of the month preceding the final payout.A PPF account matures 15 years after the end of the financial year in which it was opened. At maturity, you have three options:You may withdraw the entire balance and close the account.You may choose to let the account remain active without additional deposits. The balance continues to earn interest, and you may make one withdrawal per year. However, once you opt for continuation without deposits, you cannot revert to deposit-based continuation later.You may continue the account with deposits for additional 5-year blocks, provided the request is submitted within one year of maturity. It is this provision that allows you to become a crorepati - as explained in the section belowThe provision to extend your PPF account beyond the lock-in period of 15 years allows you to earn the benefits of compounding. The biggest advantage of a PPF investment is compounding. Your money grows - not just on the amount you invest each year - but also on the interest that you accumulate over time, creating a powerful snowball effect.Since PPF has a long 15-year lock-in, the interest added annually continues to earn more interest in the following years, leading to exponential growth—especially in the later years of the account.Even though the yearly contribution limit is capped, compounding ensures that disciplined, consistent deposits can grow into a significantly larger corpus by maturity. This makes PPF one of the most effective long-term wealth-building tools for risk-free, tax-free returns.Let’s understand this better over different investment time-frames. In a scenario where you invest the full Rs 1.5 lakh investment limit every year, you will accumulate a corpus of over Rs 40 lakh in 15 years, of which you would have invested Rs 22.5 lakh. But, if you continue to contribute to your PPF account in blocks of 5 years - then with 25 years of investment your accumulated corpus would be over Rs 1 crore, with an investment of only Rs 37.5 lakh! The interest accrued as a result of compounding would be over Rs 65 lakh!The answer depends entirely on your investment time-frame, risk taking ability and investment purpose. Experts say that PPF is ideal for conservative investors - backed by the government of India - and offering 7.1% returns with the benefits of compounding, it works well for risk averse individuals, long-term wealth builders and those who are looking to save tax.Apart from the above-mentioned category of investors, Mohit Gang - Co-Founder & CEO Moneyfront says PPF is ideal for investors looking for stable debt allocation, and those without EPF/NPS.According to Prableen Bajpai, Founder, Finfix Research & Analytics, in India, fixed income continues to dominate investor portfolios. “These asset classes provide a sense of security and comfort, but while they are popular, they often fail to reward investors over the long term. For example, bank fixed deposits do not offer true compounding, are rarely able to beat inflation, and are not tax-efficient—especially for high-income individuals,” she tells TOI.However, Prableen is of the view that government-backed schemes such as the PPF stand out due to their specific benefits. “Within the fixed-income category, PPF remains one of the best vehicles for building a long-term portfolio, particularly when the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is not available as an investment option,” she says.Mohit Gang says that PPF’s nominal return (historically ~7–9%) beats inflation, but only by a small margin. To put it simply, the long-term average rate of return for PPF is around 8%, while the average inflation is around 6%, which makes the real return around 2%, he says.•⁠ ⁠You want equity exposure + tax efficiency•⁠ ⁠You want 80CCD(1B) extra ₹50,000 tax benefit•⁠ ⁠Investment horizon is very long (till age 60)•⁠ ⁠Partial withdrawal restrictions•⁠ ⁠Taxable annuity at retirement•⁠ ⁠No guaranteed return•⁠ ⁠EPF rate (usually ~8.1–8.25%) > PPF•⁠ ⁠Mandatory contributions form the base; voluntary VPF can top-up•⁠ ⁠Salary-based compounding is larger for high earners•⁠ ⁠Only available for salaried employees•⁠ ⁠Interest rate is revised annually and can reduce•⁠ ⁠Withdrawals are restricted unless conditions met•⁠ ⁠Liquidity•⁠ ⁠Potentially higher returns depending on category•⁠ ⁠No lock-in•⁠ ⁠Gains are fully taxable at slab rate (no indexation) after April 2023 amendments•⁠ ⁠No guarantee of returns•⁠ ⁠Credit & duration risk possible•⁠ ⁠For >30% tax slab investors, post-tax returns become unattractive•⁠ ⁠Highest guaranteed small-savings rate (8.2% currently)•⁠ ⁠Similar EEE tax advantages•⁠ ⁠Use-case limited•⁠ ⁠Long lock-inPrableen believes that any long-term portfolio should ideally include a mix of debt and equity, and PPF can serve as an effective fixed-income component. “But if a higher-interest, employer-linked EPF is available, then PPF can be replaced with other higher return–generating fixed-income alternatives,” she adds.",PPF is a government-backed investment which currently offers an interest rate of 7.1%.

Vande Bharat sleeper train launch: Indian Railways is looking to launch the first Vande Bharat sleeper train soon, with the first prototype rake undergoing changes after trial runs. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that the aim is to launch the new Vande Bharat sleeper variant in December.The train has faced delays and after extensive trials of the first rake, changes have been suggested in the train to enhance passenger comfort. Vande Bharat Express has emerged as the new face of premium travel on Indian Railways. The AC chair car version, which is currently in service, caters to day travel needs. The new Vande Bharat sleeper train will look to offer superior comfort to Rajdhani Express trains on long-distance overnight routes.Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that the train will be launched in December. ‘Minor’ retrofitting work is in progress on the first Vande Bharat sleeper train to enhance passenger comfort, with the modified train set to debut next month, according to Vaishnaw.PTI quoted Vaishnaw as saying that after the trials of the first train, recommended modifications to the bogie and seats are currently being done. Vaishnaw confirmed that issues identified during the first rake's testing are being resolved in both the first and second trains.He explained that whilst the modifications are relatively small, they are being treated with significant importance to ensure optimal passenger comfort levels.“Changes are minor in nature, but we are treating them as major because we want to match the high standards of passenger comfort,” he said.Highlighting the focus on passenger welfare and safety, he emphasised their commitment to avoiding shortcuts to develop a quality product for future generations.According to the PTI report, BEML officials have confirmed receiving back the first prototype of Vande Bharat sleeper trains for modifications, following comprehensive testing and trials overseen by RDSO and the Commissioner of Railway Safety. The company is tasked with manufacturing 10 such trains.""Since it is a prototype, it is very natural to test the train on all safety and comfort parameters. The first rake is back with us after intensive testing along with the suggested modifications,"" a BEML official said.The Railway Ministry officially approved the introduction of 16-car Vande Bharat Sleeper trains on October 28, whilst recommending specific alterations for enhanced performance in the future.The safety requirements include installing Arc Fault Detection Device for fire prevention, AC duct repositioning, CCTV fire-survival cable implementation and independent assessment of European fire safety (EN 45545) and crash resistance (EN 15227) standards, amongst other measures.""Emergency alarm button and its indication sign board is found to be hidden behind the upper berth connector console and appear inaccessible to passengers for operation in emergency situations. This needs to be suitably relocated at an appropriate accessible location in the future production,"" said the October 28 letter.The ministry sent an additional letter on October 28 to RDSO and all zonal railways highlighting concerns regarding the train's interior finishing and construction quality.","The new Vande Bharat sleeper train will look to offer superior comfort to Rajdhani Express trains on long-distance overnight routes. The train has 16 coaches for passengers, including 11 AC 3 tier, 4 AC 2 tier, and one AC First class compartment. It will be a semi-high speed, self-propelled train set, capable of 160 kmph speed, and a testing speed of 180 kmph.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125479195,imgsize-105308,width-400,resizemode-4/vande-bharat-sleeper.jpg"

CLSA has an outperform rating on M&M with the target price at Rs 4,417. Analysts said that the company remains confident in maintaining its market leadership position for SUVs, tractors and LCVs. With new launches and focus on void spaces, M&M expects there is scope for further market share gains in some of the segments. The company is looking for an organic revenue compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15-40% in various segments during the FY26-FY30 period versus a 25% CAGR over the last five years on an overall basis. M&M plans to focus on export markets across all three areas of tractors with the Oja brand, LCVs with global pickup launches and UVs with new launches. The company has also upgraded its tractor volume growth guidance for FY25-FY30 from a 7% CAGR to a 9% CAGR. The company plans to grow its revenue for the LCV business by 1.6x during FY25-FY30. Analysts said M&M has aggressive plans to grow its growth gems.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Maruti Suzuki India with the target at Rs 18,489. Analysts said that the post-festive demand and booking trends are holding well.They said operating leverage and net pricing will be the key drivers of margins in the coming quarters, while discounts peaked in the July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26). The company continues to see a healthy growth rate in exports.Nuvama has a buy on Vedanta with the target price at Rs 686. Analysts said that Vedanta’s focus on demerger, delivery and deleveraging (3Ds) is on course to pay off, supported by tailwinds of commodity prices. They feel a likely favourable outcome by NCLT in Dec-25 (demerger likely by Q4FY26-end), removal of overhang (not buying JP Associates) and further Rs 20 dividend per share by Jan 26 are additional triggers. Analysts expect the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and taxes (EBITDA) to increase at a CAGR of 16% over FY25–FY28 on the back of lower aluminium cost of production, aluminium and zinc volume growth and higher commodity prices.JP Morgan has an overweight rating on TCS with the target price at Rs 4,050. Analysts said that TCS announced a partnership with PE firm TPG with a commitment to invest $1 billion for a 27-49% stake in its newly formed Data centre business, HyperVault. TCS and TPG jointly pledged to invest up to Rs 18,000 crore in HyperVault in equity over several tranches. TCS previously had announced a 1 GW AI ready data centre with an outlay of $6.5 billion with a mix of debt and equity and likely equity partners. Analysts believe the event enables TCS to embark on its capex plans while limiting TCS’s direct equity outlay to $1 billion over the next 5-6 years as it recently highlighted.Citigroup has a buy rating on L&T with the target price at Rs 4,500. Analysts said that the company sees clear opportunities in the Middle East across areas, sees potential in Europe as well and has recently announced a partnership for renewable projects integration. Domestically, an improvement in private sector projects, now 30% of the domestic backlog, is aiding growth.","CLSA has an outperform rating on M&M with the target price at Rs 4,417.

Adani looks to acquire pilot training co FSTC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-looks-to-acquire-pilot-training-co-fstc/articleshow/125527760.cms,"Representative image

Mumbai: Adani Group 's defence and aerospace unit is considering an acquisition of Flight Simulation Technique Centre (FSTC), India's leading non-captive pilot training firm, people familiar with the matter said. If the deal goes through, it will mark the group's entry into the aviation training business and ramp up its M&A portfolio.Established in 2012, FSTC has four simulator facilities in Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Mumbai, as well as four flying schools in Haryana, Surat, and Solapur, as listed on its website.The proposed FSTC transaction is expected to be routed through Horizon Aero Solutions, a 50:50 joint venture between Adani Defence Systems and Technologies (ADST) and Prime Aero. ADST is a wholly-owned subsidiary of group flagship Adani Enterprises, while Prime Aero is owned by Prajay Patel, son of Nationalist Congress Party leader Praful Patel.ADST has been building its business both organically and through acquisitions. In Dec 2024, it acquired controlling interest in Air Works, which enabled its foray into aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) business. It then furthered its presence with a 50% share purchase in Indamer Technics (the remaining 50% is held by Prime Aero).Defence and aerospace is a strategically important sector for the Adani Group, with plans to triple its investment in the near future. Currently, the group has invested Rs 5,000 crore in the sector.The potential FSTC deal will allow ADST to capitalise on the growing demand for cockpit crew, who are mandated to undergo a minimum number of flight simulation hours for training. Demand for military pilots is increasing due to rising geopolitical tensions, higher defence spends, and need for advanced skills.ADST has been supplying drones, loitering munitions, and other warfare systems to India's defence ministry, which were used during Operation Sindoor, a four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May of this year.FSTC's clientele includes Indian defence forces and commercial airlines. ""You are giving me shocking news. I'm boarding a flight. I'm going on a holiday,"" said FSTC co-founder and MD Dilawer Singh Basraon, when reached on his cell phone. An Adani Group spokesperson declined to comment on TOI's email query.In FY24, FSTC reported an operating profit of Rs 124.2 crore on a revenue of Rs 214.5 crore. A Nov 2024 note by India Ratings and Research highlighted that FSTC's revenue growth has been fueled by ongoing investments in expanding its fleet of simulators and training aircraft, funded through a mix of resources including loans. In FY23, its operating profit and revenue were Rs 96.4 crore and Rs 165.1 crore, respectively.Apart from FSTC, CAE Simulation Training, a 50:50 joint venture between Canada's CAE and InterGlobe Enterprises, also provides pilot training. Its main customers are Indigo (owned by InterGlobe) and Akasa. Additionally, there is the IPO-bound Flywings Simulator Training Centre. In Aug 2025, CAE, while announcing a new pilot training centre in Mumbai, predicted a demand for 20,000 new professional pilots in India over the next 10 years, with the Asia Pacific region requiring 98,000 pilots during the same period.","Defence and aerospace is a strategically important sector for the Adani Group.

Market watch: Asian stocks climb as rate-cut hopes steady markets; crude prices ease on Russia-Ukraine peace signals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-stocks-climb-as-rate-cut-hopes-steady-markets-crude-prices-ease-on-russia-ukraine-peace-signals/articleshow/125530910.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)

Asian equities began the week on a firmer footing as expectations for a US interest rate cut lifted sentiment across the region, even as oil prices slipped on progress in Russia-Ukraine peace efforts.Market confidence improved after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams indicated there was still “room for a further adjustment” at the Fed’s 9–10 December meeting, reported AFP.His remarks pushed the probability of a rate cut to around 70%, up sharply from earlier levels.As per CNBC, Williams suggested labour-market weakness poses a bigger economic threat than higher inflation.The shift in expectations helped Asian stocks rebound from last week’s sell-off, when fears of a tech-sector bubble—particularly in AI-linked shares—triggered a broad retreat.As per AFP, Hong Kong and Seoul jumped more than 1% on Monday, with Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Taipei also rising.South Korea’s Kospi was 1.13% higher, according to CNBC, while Samsung climbed over 4% in early trade.Japan’s markets were shut for a holiday.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 25,568.08, while China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1%.US futures also advanced after a solid Friday session on Wall Street.In Australia, CNBC reported that Qube shares surged nearly 20% after receiving an A$11.6 billion takeover offer from Macquarie Asset Management, while BHP added 0.4% after ruling out a merger with Anglo American.Alongside the equity rebound, cryptocurrencies remained under pressure. Bitcoin hovered near $87,000, up from last week’s trough but still far below its $126,200 record.Crude prices, meanwhile, edged lower. Brent was down 0.22% at $62.42 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate slipped 0.26% to $57.91, as per Reuters.The drop extended last week’s losses, driven by concerns that a breakthrough in Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations could see sanctions rolled back and previously restricted Russian crude return to the market.US President Donald Trump has set a Thursday deadline for progress, though European leaders are seeking revisions.According to Reuters, IG analyst Tony Sycamore said the sell-off was mainly fuelled by Trump’s strong push for a peace deal, which markets viewed as a “fast track” to unlocking substantial Russian supply.He added that talks overshadowed the immediate impact of fresh US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, which have stranded nearly 48 million barrels of Russian oil at sea.A strengthening US dollar has added further pressure, with the dollar index hitting its highest level since May, Reuters noted, making crude more expensive for non-US buyers.Asia-Pacific traders now await US producer price data later this week—one of the few remaining indicators before the Fed meets—after the delay of other releases due to the US government shutdown.A stronger-than-expected reading could complicate the Fed’s decisions despite recent labour-market weakness.","Hong Kong and Seoul jumped more than 1% on Monday, with Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Taipei also rising.

Economists expect RBI to cut rates as inflation eases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/economists-expect-rbi-to-cut-rates-as-inflation-eases/articleshow/125527746.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Several global banks and economists expect a 25 basis points (100 bps = 1 percentage point) repo cut in Dec 2025, possibly ending the current easing cycle. Near-zero CPI inflation in Oct has strengthened confidence that RBI's monetary policy committee can ease rates even if July-Sept growth exceeds the central bank's forecast of 7%.A cut helps borrowers but strains bank margins as lenders struggle to match deposits with credit demand. Savers may also shift to markets as nominal returns fall.""We expect RBI to deliver a 25bps repo rate cut in the Dec policy. Based on our forecast of FY27 growth, inflation and real rates, a simple Taylor Rule formula indicates that the terminal repo rate should fall to 5.25%, from 5.5% currently,"" said Kaushik Das of Deutsche Bank. Broadly, the Taylor rule guides interest rates by comparing actual inflation and output with targets. Rates rise when both run hot and fall when they undershoot.""In FY27, if CPI inflation averages 4.2-4.3% (from a likely 2% average in FY26), then real rates will remain positive by about 100bps, assuming a terminal repo rate of 5.25%, which is sufficient to maintain macro financial stability, in our view,"" added Das.The latest inflation numbers in India show a sharp decline, with consumer price index inflation dropping to a record low of 0.25% year-on-year in Oct 2025, provisional data from govt showed. This is the lowest inflation in the current CPI series since 2013. Wholesale prices are also in deflation thanks to the one-time GST cut impact.The repo rate, which influences more than half of all loans, is 5.5% after 100bps of cuts since Feb 2025: 25bps in Feb, 25bps in April, 50bps in June. Before the Covid trough of 4%, the non-Covid low was 5.15% in Oct 2019. A Dec cut to 5.25% would put policy close to that floor.Domestic growth remains firm, but external risks including trade tension and US restrictions could keep the MPC cautious even if it eases in Dec. Analysts frame the decision as calibrating the pace of easing rather than choosing between easing and tightening, part of a three-pronged cycle of adjustments in rates, liquidity and regulation. ""RBI's rate move in Dec will be a close call, as Q2 GDP data in late Nov will show growth at a firm 7%+ while Oct inflation slipped to a series low. To make a case for rate reductions despite strong growth numbers, RBI MPC will likely highlight risks to the forward-looking growth trajectory, with prevailing low inflation providing them with the necessary room to reduce rates,"" said Radhika Rao of DBS.Crisil also expects a cut, arguing that benign inflation should allow support for growth amid US tariff risks. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs share that view. Globally, several major central banks have begun or continued easing because inflation is subdued and growth is cooling, giving the RBI a supportive backdrop.",Several global banks and economists expect a 25 basis points (100 bps = 1 percentage point) repo cut in Dec 2025. Near-zero CPI inflation in Oct has strengthened confidence that RBI's monetary policy committee can ease rates.

BENGALURU: Wealth-management startup Wealthy has raised Rs 130 crore ($14.5 million) in a Series B round led by Bertelsmann India Investments, as per a statement. Existing investor Alphawave Global, new investor Shepherd's Hill and a group of technology entrepreneurs also participated.The company provides an AI enabled platform for mutual fund distributors and independent wealth professionals. Wealthy said the funding will be used to invest in technology, expand into smaller cities, onboard 50,000 distributors and work towards reaching Rs 1 lakh crore in assets under management.The company offers AI powered advisory workflows, analytics, onboarding tools that it claims enable KYC in under two minutes and enterprise grade digital tools for distributors. The company has 20 offices across major cities and a team of more than 250 people.Founded by Aditya Agarwal and Prashant Gupta, the firm handles over Rs 300 crore in monthly transactions and works with over 6,000 mutual fund distributors who serve more than 1 lakh clients across more than 1,000 towns. Client assets worth Rs 5,000 crore are currently managed on the platform. Wealthy said it onboards more than 350 distributors every month.The Bengaluru-based startup said it is targeting the growing pool of independent mutual fund distributors. It added that while these distributors have doubled to nearly 2 lakh in five years, most still lack the digital infrastructure needed to compete with large institutions. According to the firm, distributors spend close to 70% of their time on manual processes such as KYC and compliance.Co-founder Gupta said Wealthy aims to support a new segment of independent wealth professionals, including former bankers and relationship managers who are leaving institutional roles to build their own practices. The platform provides technology, research support and access to products across mutual funds, equities, bonds, PMS, AIFs and insurance, he added.Rohit Sood, partner at Bertelsmann India Investments, said less than 15% of Indian households have exposure to equities and that this number could rise meaningfully as the country moves towards developed market income levels.","Bengaluru-based startup Wealthy has raised $14.5 million in a Series B round.

How optimistic are you about the future of India against the backdrop of global uncertainty and geopolitical tensions?

Arvind Panagariya, chairman of the 16th Finance Commission, spoke to TOI after submitting the panel's report. He speaks on a range of issues from growth prospects for the economy to reforms that need to be pushed. Excerpts:Growth prospects in the short to medium term remain excellent. For reasons difficult to understand, forecasts for India consistently underestimate growth.Govt has shown impressive progress in infrastructure build-up, ended the exemption raj in personal income taxation, instituted a two-rate GST, and now implemented the mother of all reforms - the four labour codes. Given these recent developments and the 7.8% growth already achieved in the first quarter, we will easily beat current forecasts and cross the 7% growth mark in 2025-26. In the coming years, we will not only sustain this growth but, with states joining in advancing the reforms, accelerate it.India's central challenge remains creating high-productivity, well-paid jobs for the masses.The mass of India's workforce is currently employed in low-productivity jobs, with a majority self-employed. According to the latest 2023-24 Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS), 46% of workers are in agriculture, and half of India's agricultural holdings are smaller than half a hectare. Another 40% of the workers are either self-employed or in establishments with fewer than 10 workers, with access to minimum capital. Only about 10% of the workers are in enterprises with 20 or more workers. Despite three decades since the launch of economic reforms, we have not been able to break out of the Nehru-era industrial edifice, with capital and skilled labour remaining concentrated in a handful of highly capital-intensive sectors, while micro and small establishments populate labour-intensive sectors.This is a choice ours to make. Underlying this choice is also the choice between long-run growth of 6-7% and 9-10%. The latter is what the Asian majors achieved during their high-growth phases (Asian tigers during 1960-90 and China during 1980-2015). With the exports-to-GDP ratio rising from 7% in 1990-91 to 25% at peak in the mid-2010s and imports rising from 10% to above 30% over the same period, trade has been an extremely important contributor to India's accelerated growth in the post-reform era. Yet it remains true that we have not fully exploited this instrument, which means our growth, though very substantial, has been slower than it could have been.Within our hugely diverse democracy, change is slow. Even though we have made significant progress since 1991, much remains to be done. No doubt, the just implemented four labour codes give the reforms a major shot in the arm.States must take the labour-market reforms further. Urban land markets are highly distorted, with land prices relative to per capita urban incomes among the highest in the world. Custom duties need to be rationalised and reduced. Privatisation of public-sector enterprises in non-strategic sectors needs to be revived. Trade agreements with the US and the EU need to be concluded. I understand the delay in the signing of the former, but what is holding us back on the latter?We also need a major shift in mindset when designing regulations, especially at the RBI and other financial institutions. The regulations should be aimed at the 95% who wish to transact within the law rather than the 5% who want to operate outside it. Overly strict regulation deters not the 5% who intend to violate it under all circumstances, but rather economic activity by those who are committed to following it. Violators are supposed to be deterred through strict enforcement and prosecution.My recommendation would be to use this time of global uncertainty to implement the numerous pending domestic economic reforms. In the end, there is no substitute for building a 10 trillion-dollar economy. Heft in the international power game ultimately flows from a nation's relative economic weight.Arvind Panagariya, chairman of the 16th Finance Commission, spoke to TOI after submitting the panel's report.

Yet it remains true that we have not fully exploited this instrument, which means our growth, though very substantial, has been slower than it could have been.Within our hugely diverse democracy, change is slow. Even though we have made significant progress since 1991, much remains to be done. No doubt, the just implemented four labour codes give the reforms a major shot in the arm.States must take the labour-market reforms further. Urban land markets are highly distorted, with land prices relative to per capita urban incomes among the highest in the world. Custom duties need to be rationalised and reduced. Privatisation of public-sector enterprises in non-strategic sectors needs to be revived. Trade agreements with the US and the EU need to be concluded. I understand the delay in the signing of the former, but what is holding us back on the latter?We also need a major shift in mindset when designing regulations, especially at the RBI and other financial institutions. The regulations should be aimed at the 95% who wish to transact within the law rather than the 5% who want to operate outside it. Overly strict regulation deters not the 5% who intend to violate it under all circumstances, but rather economic activity by those who are committed to following it. Violators are supposed to be deterred through strict enforcement and prosecution.My recommendation would be to use this time of global uncertainty to implement the numerous pending domestic economic reforms. In the end, there is no substitute for building a 10 trillion-dollar economy. Heft in the international power game ultimately flows from a nation's relative economic weight.","Arvind Panagariya, chairman of the 16th Finance Commission, spoke to TOI after submitting the panel's report.

Toxic smog chokes Delhi: Air quality turns 'severe' as AQI soars to 427 despite GRAP-III measures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/toxic-smog-chokes-delhi-air-quality-turns-severe-as-aqi-soars-to-427-despite-grap-iii-measures/articleshow/125375137.cms,"Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as 'very poor' — despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog continued to blanket Delhi on Monday, showing little improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 385.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Iconic areas like India Gate and Kartavya Path were shrouded in toxic smog, with AQI readings of 341 (‘very poor’). Other hotspots included Chandni Chowk (383), RK Puram (366), ITO (394), Punjabi Bagh (384), Patparganj (369), Pusa (365), and Dwarka Sector-8 (356).Meanwhile, Anand Vihar remained engulfed in a layer of toxic smog, with the CPCB reporting an AQI of 383, classified as ‘very poor’.The thick smog, along with deteriorating air quality, mercury continued to hover around the 9 Degree Celsius mark, with some areas recording even lower temperatures.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.Following the deteriorating air quality in the national capital, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III was implemented on November 11 across Delhi by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The measures aim to control emissions through stricter restrictions on construction, vehicular movement and industrial operations.Under GRAP-III, restrictions include a ban on most non-essential construction, limits on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of in-person classes for students up to Class 5 with a shift to online or hybrid learning, curbs on industries using non-clean fuels, and a ban on non-emergency diesel generators.Earlier, the Supreme Court directed the governments of Punjab and Haryana to file a status report on the measures taken to curb stubble burning, which contributes to the air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region.A bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered, ""We direct the state of Punjab and Haryana to file a report on what steps are being taken to curb stubble burning.""Since Diwali, air quality in Delhi and the NCR has remained in the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories in several areas, despite Stage III of the GRAP being in effect.","The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am.

Inside FurtherAI’s Bid to Rethink Insurance Workflows

You

in

that

resented

On a recent afternoon in San Francisco, Aman's grandmother called from Bhopal to tell him she had started using AI.She is 85, the kind of north Indian grandmother who still rises at four every morning for puja. So Aman Gour, co-founder and CEO of FurtherAI, did what any AI founder would do when his octogenarian nani announces a tech pivot.“What AI are you using?” he asked. “ChatGPT?”“No, beta,” she said. “Whenever I have questions, I call you.are my AI. Aman's Intelligence.”It’s a joke with a sharp little truth inside it. Long before large language models began absorbing the world’s PDFs, there were grandchildren on patchy phone lines answering questions about the internet and more importantly, WhatsApp settings. Intelligence, artificial or otherwise, has always been relational.FurtherAI, the company Aman now runs out of a new office that “looks like a regal insurance building,” is very muchthe business of building that relationship between machine and human into something practical: a kind of AI workspace for the people who keep the modern economy insured.If you’ve never thought about how insurance actually gets done, the industry is one of those invisible infrastructures (like sewers or DNS) that only makes headlines when something goes wrong.But for underwriters, brokers, and claims adjusters, the day-to-day reality is screens full of PDFs, spreadsheets, and emails.“We met these folks who are basically managing trillions in risk,” Aman told me. “And they’re spending their days copying numbers from one place to another.”To understand why somebody would devote their life to automating the unglamorous middle of commercial insurance, it helps to picture a boy in a kirana shop in Bhopal, sitting between two men who disagreed about time.One was his father, a shopkeeper who would later build a small empire of gas stations. For him, time was scarce. “You have 24 hours,” he told his son. “Get the best out of it.” Sundays were for work; that’s simply what adults did.The other was his grandfather, a teacher. Life is long, he would say. There is time.As a child, Aman sat on a low stool between the counter and sacks of grain, literally looking left and right at these two philosophies. On the wall, decades later, his grandfather would tape up a Times of India clipping of Ajay Banga and ask, “Aman, when are you going to come here?”Aman didn’t know, but the question lodged somewhere. It became, over time, the sentence he now carries around in his head: “Live micro, plan macro.” Work hard on the day in front of you; keep a larger pattern loosely in mind.The “micro” started with the well-worn Indian script: Bhopal to Kota for IIT coaching (“the infamous Bansal classes”), waking at 3:30 AM to stay ahead of an ocean of teenage ambition; from Kota to IIT Bombay for computer science; from there to a coveted job at Microsoft. He describes himself as more hard-working than brilliant, forever a little uneasy among the effortless prodigies who could do absurd mental math after three beers, but he kept finding ways to climb.Then, as tends to happen in stories like this, boredom and curiosity conspired. At Microsoft, he entered an internal hackathon, built something that did well, and realized he wanted to build entire products. He quit to start his first company, TurboHire, which used AI to automate recruitment workflows and eventually scaled to more than a million dollars in ARR.It was an innovative SaaS business that grew to over a million dollars in revenue and taught Aman how to build companies from scratch — and eventually, he exited and moved to the Bay Area to start the next chapter.When Aman and his eventual co-founder, Sashank Gondala, applied to Y Combinator, they did it with a different idea, though: AI for software testing. The idea made perfect sense to them; it, in fact, got them into the program. But sitting in the compressed, slightly feverish atmosphere of YC, listening to partners who had seen hundreds of start-ups either catch fire or quietly fade out, they were forced into a distinction.“Tom Blomfield told us there are zero-million-dollar companies and zero-billion-dollar companies,” Aman recalled, referring to the Monzo founder who is now a YC group partner. “In the beginning they both have zero in revenue. But one is built to go public, and one isn’t.”Their testing idea, they realized, was a zero-million. A nice business. Just notbusiness.There are easy ways to respond to feedback like that. You can decide the partner is wrong, double down on your vision, and keep going. More dangerously, you can pinball from idea to idea in what founders call “pivot hell,” never staying long enough with any of them to know if they actually work.The harder thing is to hold the steering wheel steady while you change the road beneath you.Blomfield’s advice was oddly specific: go look at vertical AI. Pick one industry with dense unstructured data, shrinking margins, and lousy tools. Commit to it for three months. Then decide.“We resisted at first,” Aman said. “We didn’t know anything. We didn’t know what lawyers do, what insurers do, what people in logistics actually do all day.”But he and Sashank also knew their own pattern. For nearly a decade, both had been working on workflow automation, getting machines to handle the boring parts of knowledge work.The insurance industry is built on documents: broker submissions, property schedules, loss runs, policy forms, endorsements. These documents arrive in every format imaginable (scanned PDFs, semi-structured Excel, email attachments), and then have to be reconciled, checked, and entered into systems that mostly don’t talk to one another. Meanwhile, the workforce is aging; one widely cited estimate suggests the American insurance industry could lose more than 400K workers by 2026, even as more than 3M professionals still spend most of their time on manual data entry and document review.Previously, there were two reasons this stayed stubbornly human: machines were bad at reading messy documents, and the rule trees required to model insurance logic were too brittle to maintain. Knowing when a “cat” was a catastrophe rather than an animal was not something you could embed in a template.The arrival of LLMs changed that calculus. If you could combine an LLM’s ability to read with a serious, industry-specific understanding of insurance, maybe you could build something more interesting than yet another dashboard. Think: An AI colleague of sorts who could do the grinding work and leave the humans to decide what to bind or decline.That, at least, was the hypothesis. To test it, they bought donuts.There is something faintly absurd about the co-founder of a Bay Area AI company driving around the Bay Area with a box of donuts, knocking on the doors of insurance agencies like a pharma rep in a previous era. But this is exactly what Aman did.“We literally went door to door,” he said, laughing. “Box of donuts, no appointments. ‘Hey, I know we’re disturbing your day, but can we talk to you about what you do?’”Part of the exercise was ethnographic. They needed to see, with their own eyes, how underwriters and brokers actually spent their days: where the spreadsheets lived, which PDFs they ignored until the last minute, which “systems of record” were silently bypassed by forwarding emails.Part of it was cultural. Insurance is still, in many lines, ‘a specific kind of individual’s relationship’ industry. As two South Asian founders from IIT Bombay with little formal background in insurance, Aman and Sashank needed to know if they could earn trust here, or if they would be better off chasing a different vertical.They found, somewhat to their surprise, that the relationship orientation worked in their favor. Agents and underwriters made time. People answered questions. The donuts probably helped. The discomfort of door-knocking gave way to a delighted discovery: these were pragmatic people who cared about their customers,their software, and had a clear sense of which tasks they would gladly offload.Those early days are still etched in the way Aman talks about the company. Insurance is not “slow to adopt technology,” he insists. The tech simply hasn’t been good enough, tailored enough, to justify the pain of change.“If we can build good tech that actually understands their world,” he said, “it should solve a lot of their problems.”Strip away the jargon, and FurtherAI’s core product is that it reads documents, moves data, and follows rules on behalf of insurance teams. The company calls it an “AI workspace for insurance”, a kind of operating layer that sits between a carrier’s email inboxes, rating engines, broker portals, and policy admin systems.Here’s one way to picture it.Imagine you’re an underwriter at a mid-sized specialty carrier. On Monday morning, you open your inbox to a dozen new submissions from brokers: each one a package of applications, engineering reports, loss histories, spreadsheets, and the occasional scanned PDF someone faxed in 2007. Your job is to decide which risks to quote, which to decline, and which to refer for more information.In the traditional workflow, you’d start manually extracting key data points: addresses, limits, deductibles, and prior losses into your underwriting workbench. You’d cross-check the numbers against your own guidelines: appetite by class and geography, aggregation limits, underwriting authority thresholds. For renewals, you’d dig up last year’s policy and compare terms clause by clause. All of this is mentally taxing.In the FurtherAI version of that day, the submissions are fed through an AI “teammate” that has been trained specifically on insurance documents. It knows that “cat” in a property schedule probably means catastrophe, not a pet. It can tell the difference between “named windstorm coverage excluded” and “windstorm deductible applies.” It parses the submissions, fills in the required fields in your internal systems, flags missing data, compares policies, and presents you with a clean summary plus exceptions.One of FurtherAI’s differentiators, and the reason they insist on calling themselves “insurance-native,” is that each customer uploads their own underwriting guidelines, rating factors, and routing rules. The AI learns those and applies them consistently, rather than imposing a standard model on everyone.Carriers and brokers using FurtherAI now process premiums each year through the platform, automating tasks from submission intake and policy comparisons to compliance checks and, increasingly, parts of claims handling.FurtherAI has gained enough traction that’s helped the company raise a $25M Series A in October, led by a16z, which brought its total funding to about $30M, one of the larger early-stage AI bets in the insurance space.Aman is fond of a simple metaphor when he talks about AI strategy. The smartest move, he argues, is to build what’s core, and buy what scales.Training the largest AI models now costs hundreds of millions of dollars and carries all the operational risk that implies. For most insurers, building a proprietary model end-to-end makes little sense. But buying a generic model and expecting it to understand the nuances of an engineering report, or a layered property program, is equally naïve.FurtherAI’s answer is to sit in between. The company uses a mix of large language models under the hood(a “multi-LLM stack” in the current jargon), but wraps them in insurance-specific data structures, workflows, and human-in-the-loop designs.For each client, a “forward-deployed” AI engineer works alongside underwriters or operations staff to map their current processes, tune the workflows, and agree on what the AI is allowed to do autonomously versus what should always be reviewed.Although the longer-term plan is still to be realized, the direction of travel is clear. McKinsey and others have started talking about “agentic AI”: systems that can string together multiple tasks to execute a workflow, and insurance, with its stable logic and paper-heavy processes, is a natural candidate.The question, then, is whether AI will show up as a blunt cost-cutting instrument, or as something closer to Aman's grandmother’s definition: a trusted second brain that lets humans do more of the work that actually matters to them.If Aman is the storyteller of FurtherAI, his co-founder, Sashank Gondala, is the engineer in the background making sure the story holds together.They met as undergraduates at IIT Bombay: Aman the hardworking generalist who threw himself into student politics and leadership roles, Sashank the one who simply “looked really smart.” Aman still calls him “the smartest person I’ve ever met,” and does so with incredible admiration.After IIT, Sashank went on to do a master’s in computer science with a focus on ML at GeorgiaTech, and then joined Apple as a language modeling scientist, working on the core models that power Siri. Every time Siri mangled Aman's name, he would send Sashank a teasing message. Gradually, the pair began to talk less about pronunciation and more about what else this kind of tech could do.The division of labor at FurtherAI is typical of many founder pairs: Aman sells; Sashank builds. But in industries like insurance, the fact that the person building the models has spent years sweating the edge cases of human language is part of the pitch.If you are not an underwriter in Cleveland or a broker in Dallas, you might reasonably wonder why you should care about the automation of insurance workflows.Part of the answer is pedestrian: cost. In most lines of insurance, somewhere between 25 and 40 cents of every premium dollar goes to operating expense: processing, administration, distribution. If AI-based automation can safely cut that expense ratio, the savings can show up as cheaper premiums or better coverage.Part of it is about resilience. Insurance is where many of society’s slow-burn crises show up first. Healthcare cost inflation becomes a set of choices about which drugs and procedures plans will cover. Each of these decisions is mediated through documents and workflows. Making those workflows faster and more transparent can make it easier for humans to see what they’re deciding.And part of it is about work itself. In almost every white-collar industry, there is a running argument about AI: will it replace us or help us? The unsatisfying but likely accurate answer is “both, depending.”What makes the FurtherAI story interesting, beyond the funding round and the logos on the slide, is that it takes seriously the idea that some work should disappear. Not the judgment calls, not the relationship building, but the cut-and-paste toil that, if you’re honest, no one will miss.There is still risk here. Automation can become an excuse for headcount reduction rather than a chance to invest in better service. AI systems are only as good as the data they’re trained on and the guardrails around them. Privacy and regulatory compliance in insurance are table stakes.Aman likes to joke that in one evening at a friend’s wedding, he found both his life partner and his work partner.He had gone reluctantly, pulled there by a phone call and “a lot of melodrama” from the groom, and ran into an old IIT classmate who was doing her MBA at Wharton. She tried to set him up with a friend. But he was interested in her. There were numbers exchanged, some via back-channels, and then, gradually, a relationship that would require a more consequential decision.At the time, Aman was running his first company in India. She would be in the Bay Area. So how would they make it work? “That’s the last thing I want to worry about,” he told her. “I’ll figure it out.”Moving countries for love meant leaving a company he had built, dealing with visas, and starting again in a place where his network was thinner. The old voices in the kirana shop (hurry up, life is long), were suddenly in tension again. He decided, as he tends to, by taking the next step and trusting the pattern.“When that happens in one evening,” he likes to say now, “imagine what can happen in a year.”There is a similar mixture of impatience and patience in how he talks about the future of FurtherAI. The near-term goal is audacious but conventional: build a billion-dollar company, take it public, justify the confidence of investors like Andreessen Horowitz and the early carriers who bet on them.The longer-term ambition is more modest and, in its way, more demanding: build something that his father and grandfather would recognize as worthwhile when they read about it in the paper. A company that makes the daily lives of people inside it kinder. And less frantic.On Saturdays, he doesn’t work. He and his wife have chai, take swing lessons at the golf range, sometimes go for a hike. He meditates more than he used to. The boy who grew up believing that Sundays were for the shop has chosen, consciously, to step away one day a week. The micro has shifted.In Bhopal, his grandmother still wakes up at 4 to pray, still calls her grandson with questions when she has them. She is amused by the idea that her off-hand description (“Aman’s Intelligence”) might be the kernel of his philosophy about AI. But it fits.If the future of work in insurance, or in any industry, is going to be mediated by machines that read, write, and act on our behalf, then the question isn’t just how powerful those machines are. It’s who they feel like when they pick up the phone.Aman’s bet, with FurtherAI, is that they should feel less like a black box and more like a trusted grandchild: someone who clears the busywork, remembers your rules, and gives you back the one resource his father and grandfather never stopped arguing about.Time.","Aman Gour is the co-founder and CEO of FurtherAI, a company that uses AI to improve insurance workflows.

US-Venezuela tensions: Airlines cancel flights from Caracas; FAA warns of unsafe airspace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-venezuela-tensions-airlines-cancel-flights-from-caracas-faa-warns-of-unsafe-airspace/articleshow/125516494.cms,"(AP)

Venezuela CUT OFF, U.S. Forces Surround Maduro; Global Airlines Halt Flights Ahead Of U.S. Attack

Multiple international airlines suspended their departures from Venezuela on Saturday, following a US aviation alert warning of unsafe conditions in the country’s airspace. The cancellations come amid heightened tensions as the United States prepares a new phase of operations targeting Venezuela, raising concerns about the stability of the region.Gol of Brazil, Avianca of Colombia and TAP Air Portugal pulled their scheduled flights from Caracas, according to Flightradar24 and updates from Simon Bolivar Maiquetia International Airport. Colombia’s aviation authority said there were “potential risks” for aircraft operating near Maiquetia because of worsening security and increased military presence in the area.TAP Air Portugal said its Saturday and upcoming Tuesday services would not operate. “This decision follows information issued by the United States aviation authorities, which indicates that safety conditions in Venezuelan airspace are not guaranteed,” the airline told Reuters.Spain’s Iberia also decided to pause flights to Caracas starting Monday, although the company’s Saturday service to Madrid took off.“The company will assess the situation to decide when to resume flights to that country,” its spokesperson said.Other airlines, including Copa Airlines and Wingo, continued their scheduled operations from the airport. Latam Airlines also canceled its Bogotá flight planned for Sunday, according to Flightradar24.The FAA notice cited the “worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela,” cautioning that the environment posed risks to civil aircraft at all flight levels. The advisory comes as the Trump administration increases its military presence in the Caribbean, including deploying a major aircraft carrier, multiple warships, and F-35 fighter jets.In addition to these maneuvers, four US officials told Reuters that Washington is preparing a new phase of operations against Venezuela, which could include covert actions aimed at weakening or potentially removing President Nicolás Maduro from power. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the plans.Maduro, who has led Venezuela since 2013, has repeatedly accused the US of trying to unseat him and insists that Venezuelan citizens and the military are prepared to resist any foreign intervention.","Gol of Brazil, Avianca of Colombia and TAP Air Portugal pulled their scheduled flights from Caracas.

Bitcoin fell sharply on Friday, closing at $80,553, while ether also hit a four-month low, as cryptocurrencies led a sell-off in riskier assets. Analysts warned that dropping below $80,000 could bring even bigger losses for the world’s largest digital currency.The decline comes amid investor concerns about expensive tech stocks and uncertainty over near-term US interest rate decisions. Cryptocurrencies, often seen as a measure of market risk appetite, have reflected weak sentiment in the markets, with AI-focused stocks falling and volatility rising.Bitcoin has lost 12% in the past week, wiping out its gains for the year, and ether is down nearly 19% so far in 2025. The drop comes after a strong rally earlier this year that pushed bitcoin above $120,000 in October, helped by favorable global regulations for crypto. Analysts said the market remains sensitive after last month’s record single-day liquidation of more than $19 billion in positions.""If it's telling a story about risk sentiment as a whole, then things could start to get really, really ugly, and that's the concern now,"" said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, as quoted by Reuters.The fall also puts pressure on crypto treasury companies, which hold large amounts of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets.Standard Chartered said a drop below $90,000 could leave around half of these holdings “underwater,” meaning the assets are worth less than what was paid. Some firms may need to raise funds or sell part of their holdings, which could push prices lower.Listed companies hold about 4% of all bitcoin and 3.1% of ether, according to Standard Chartered.Citi analyst Alex Saunders noted that $80,000 is an important level, around the average price that bitcoin is held at in exchange-traded funds. Market tracker CoinGecko said the total value of all cryptocurrencies has fallen by roughly $1.2 trillion in the last six weeks.Shares of crypto treasury companies have also dropped. Strategy (MSTR.O), the largest firm in this group, has seen its stock fall 61% since July, leaving it down nearly 40% for the year. JP Morgan said Strategy could be removed from some MSCI equity indexes, which could force further selling by funds that track the company. Japanese company Metaplanet (3350.T) has dropped about 80% from its June peak, according to Reuters.Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra Markets, said past bitcoin sell-offs in 2018 and 2022 saw prices fall 75% to 80%. If that happens again, bitcoin could drop as low as $25,000. ""I am not saying we are in crypto winter. Just offering a reminder that 75%/80% drawdowns have been part of the game in bitcoin,"" he said.","Bitcoin closes at $80,553, while ether hits four-month low.

US President Donald Trump once again defended his aggressive tariff strategy, claiming it is generating “TRILLIONS of Dollars” for America and has functioned as a powerful tool to prevent international conflicts.In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump wrote, “We are taking in TRILLIONS of Dollars in Tariffs and Investment Dollars from foreign lands because of Tariffs. I have stopped 5 of the eight WARS directly because of the threat of Tariffs if they don’t stop fighting or, better yet, if they start.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that he has solved 8 wars across the globe, including brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan during the May standoff by threatening them with 350 per cent tariffs.Trump further argued that tariffs are vital to the US economy and security. “There is almost no Inflation, and the worst in USA History under Sleepy Joe Biden,” he said, adding, “The Stock Market just hit an ALL-TIME HIGH for the 48th time in 9 months.”Turning to his critics, Trump targeted Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo, the Koch network, and foreign governments for “ripping off"" the US through the use of their own tariffs.Trump’s criticism of Leo follows a public fallout earlier this year. In May, he attacked his once ally after the US Court of International Trade struck down his tariffs, calling him a “sleazebag” who “probably hates America.”The latest remarks add to Trump’s ongoing defence of his tariff-driven agenda, which he continues to frame as central to US strength both at home and abroad.","US President Donald Trump once again defended his aggressive tariff strategy.

Manufacturing slowdown: US factory activity slows as tariffs push up prices; services sector cushions overall growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/manufacturing-slowdown-us-factory-activity-slows-as-tariffs-push-up-prices-services-sector-cushions-overall-growth/articleshow/125506522.cms,"AI image

Manufacturing hit by rising prices and weak demand



Tariffs squeeze households, sentiment weakens



Services sector keeps overall activity steady



US manufacturing slipped to a four-month low in November as tariffs pushed up prices and dampened demand.According to news agency Reuters, the slowdown caused a build-up of unsold goods, raising concerns that it may drag down wider economic growth.S&P Global said the flash US manufacturing PMI eased to 51.9 from 52.5 in October, with new orders dropping to 51.3 and inventories rising to the highest level recorded in the survey.Chris Williamson of S&P Global Market Intelligence said manufacturers faced “a worrying combination of slower new orders growth and a record rise in finished goods stock,” cautioning that output may weaken further unless demand revives.Reuters reported that consumers are increasingly reluctant to buy long-lasting manufactured goods. The University of Michigan’s latest survey showed a sharp fall in purchasing conditions, adding that “consumers remain frustrated about the persistence of high prices and weakening incomes.”US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have pushed up import costs, placing additional pressure on lower- and middle-income families.A recent stock-market sell-off has also dented confidence among wealthier Americans, who had earlier supported spending.Economist Sung Won Sohn was quoted by Reuters as saying that those at the lower-income end “will probably not spend very much,” adding that uncertainty in markets “is going to hurt even the spending of wealthier people, especially retirees.”Despite the factory-sector slowdown, broader business activity remained solid.The US Composite PMI Output Index rose to 54.8, supported by a stronger services sector. Reuters reported that services PMI climbed to 55.0, driven by better new business orders and improved confidence linked to expectations of further rate cuts, the end of the 43-day government shutdown and easing political concerns.Consumer sentiment inched up to 51 in the University of Michigan survey, though it stayed below October’s level. Joanne Hsu, who heads the survey, said sentiment among households with large stock holdings dropped due to late-month market declines.Inflation pressures remained elevated, with businesses reporting higher input costs and increased prices for goods and services.Consumers also expect stronger inflation in the next year, Reuters said, even as five-year expectations eased slightly to 3.4%.Though the PMI suggested no sharp deterioration in the labour market, hiring softened marginally, with private-sector employment slipping to 51.0 amid tariff-related cost concerns.","US manufacturing slipped to a four-month low in November as tariffs pushed up prices and dampened demand.

IPO market cools after shutdown: US listings slow as SEC backlog delays approvals; tech slump adds pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ipo-market-cools-after-shutdown-us-listings-slow-as-sec-backlog-delays-approvals-tech-slump-adds-pressure/articleshow/125506227.cms,"Several recent IPOs have lost momentum after strong debuts

Broader markets weigh on sentiment

Investor appetite remains strong despite volatility

Key IPO candidates for 2026 include Databricks, Canva, and Plaid, AP reported.

The strong run in US initial public offerings has lost momentum due to the government shutdown and increased investor caution, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) works through a backlog of regulatory filings, according to market participants.Many IPOs expected in late 2025 are likely to be pushed to 2026 as the SEC clears “hundreds of registration statements,” AP reported. Listings that did debut recently have seen limited gains amid concerns that stocks have become expensive following another year of double-digit market returns.“A backlogged SEC, the approaching holiday slowdown, and pressure on AI and other tech stocks are all weighing on hopes for a near-term rebound,” Bill Smith, CEO of Renaissance Capital, said in a note to investors.Despite delays, several IPOs already advanced through the regulatory pipeline are expected to list in November and December.Central Bancompany, which went public after the shutdown, raised $373 million through its IPO on Thursday. November remains on track to be among the slowest IPO months of 2025, Renaissance Capital said.Upcoming large listings could include medical supplies company Medline, potentially raising up to $5 billion in December, while cryptocurrency technology firm BitGo also remains a candidate for a listing next month.Shares of Figma, which tripled on debut after pricing at $33 per share in July, are now trading slightly above their IPO price. Swedish buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, priced at $40 in September, is now trading near $29.Cloud services company CoreWeave, listed at $40 in March, jumped initially but has retreated to around $72. Software firm Navan, listed at $25 during the shutdown, is now trading near $15.The S&P 500 has fallen 3.5% in November, driven by a slide in technology shares following concerns about valuations tied to artificial-intelligence-linked stocks. However, the index is still up more than 12% this year, while the Nasdaq has gained over 15%.Renaissance Capital’s IPO Index is down about 0.8% this year and has lagged the S&P 500 since mid-October.“What that shows is that investors very quickly monetized, they didn't want to take the long-term risk,” said Samuel Kerr, head of global equity capital markets at Mergermarket.Analysts say high valuations in public markets may continue to push investors toward IPOs as alternative entry points.“Increasingly, as a money manager, you have to find other places to make money and typically, IPOs are that place,” said David Kaufman, partner and co-chair of the corporate & securities practice at Thompson Coburn LLP, AP quoted. “You continue to have all these large mutual funds and money managers with excess cash and no place to put this cash.”The slowdown masks a surge in behind-the-scenes activity, Kaufman added: “It’s a busy time for lawyers and bankers trying to tee things up for the first and second quarter of next year.”",Many IPOs expected in late 2025 are likely to be pushed to 2026.

Are we all living inside an AI bubble? Inside circular deals and the quiet financial loop they created,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/are-living-in-an-ai-bubble-inside-chatgpt-openai-microsoft-anthropic-nvidia-circular-deals-and-thier-financial-loop/articleshow/125504773.cms,"What does it mean?

and are we in an

AI bubble

?

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Inside the loop: What are circular Deals





The loop is tight, lucrative, and increasingly enormous.

But why do they exist?

So are we in a bubble?





first need to look at the scale of the investments:

A market bigger than pharma

OpenAI’s revenue and the pricing question





Would raising prices fix OpenAI’s financial pressure?

How Oracle became an unlikely winner





Oracle invests in the infrastructure OpenAI needs.

OpenAI commits to spending billions on Oracle Cloud to run its models.

Oracle gains a marquee client and a narrative shift that boosts investor confidence.

Echoes of the dot-com bubble - and what burst it





It wasn’t one factor it was a cluster of external shocks:

Antitrust action against Microsoft: The US government’s lawsuit rattled confidence in the entire tech sector. The perception of regulatory overreach pushed investors to reassess risk. Corporate accounting scandals: MicroStrategy famously restated its financial results, triggering panic around revenue inflation across the industry. The broader macro unwind: The housing market began showing cracks; interest rates shifted; capital costs rose. Companies dependent on cheap financing suddenly found credit scarce. Telecom overbuild and bad debt: Cisco, Lucent and others extended supplier financing to customers who were effectively insolvent. When those loans went bad, the write-downs cascaded.

Has AI faced a similar shock yet?





Regulatory scrutiny has been loud but not existential.

OpenAI’s internal governance turmoil did not derail the company.

Supply chain shortages have slowed but not stopped GPU availability.

High interest rates have not dried up capital for AI megaprojects.

So, this is sustainable?





Investors are split.

The bullish case

AI is transformative Compute demand is compounding Early investment will pay off across decades Circular deals are simply a modern way to bootstrap hyper-scale infrastructure

The bearish case

The sector’s valuations rely on uninterrupted optimism Cash flows are disguised by internal loops Capital expenditure requirements are too high for current revenue One external shock could trigger cascading losses

A revolution built on a loop





Three years ago, generative AI was barely on anyone’s radar. Three months ago, circular deals were whispered about only in private meetings at big banks. Weeks and days ago, these loops were still a niche topic. Today, they are all anyone on Wall Street can talk about.As investments swell: from $100 billion chip deals to multi-gigawatt data-centre projects, questions are mounting.The first question is:A growing number of AI firms and their partners are engaging in “circular” financing, a loop in which the same companies that pour money into AI start-ups are also the ones selling them the infrastructure they need to survive.It has created what can be described as an ouroboros ecosystem, a self-feeding financial creature devouring its own tail. And as the numbers balloon from $100 billion chip deals to multi-gigawatt data-centre projects questions are rising about how sustainable this loop really is.Circular deals are straightforward in theory but unusually powerful in practice. An AI company receives immense investment from a tech giant and then commits to spending that money back with the same investor on cloud compute, chips, and infrastructure.Take one of the clearest examples: Microsoft and Nvidia’s multi-billion-dollar commitments to Anthropic. The start-up received around $15 billion from the two giants, but simultaneously committed to spend $30 billion on Microsoft’s Azure cloud and Nvidia GPUs. On paper, it looks like a huge show of confidence in Anthropic. In reality, a large portion of that investment will flow straight back into the pockets of Microsoft and Nvidia via long-term infrastructure contracts. OpenAI , the sector’s flagship, takes this circularity even further. Nvidia has reportedly pledged up to $100 billion in investment; OpenAI, in turn, is one of the largest buyers of Nvidia GPUs on the planet. AMD struck similar agreements, providing next-generation chips while granting OpenAI warrants that allow it to buy a stake in AMD for a symbolic price meaning OpenAI pays AMD for hardware while simultaneously holding equity that benefits if AMD succeeds.Meanwhile, Oracle is deeply embedded as OpenAI’s cloud backend. The two companies are building new AI super-data-centres under a partnership nominally worth over $300 billion. OpenAI receives compute capacity now but is committed to paying Oracle roughly the same amount over the next five years.SoftBank’s arrangements with OpenAI operate in the same space: it injects capital into the company and simultaneously builds infrastructure for OpenAI’s Stargate project, which OpenAI then commits to paying for across the next decade.The AI boom’s most limited resource is not talent or data, it's computers. Training frontier AI models requires hundreds of thousands of GPUs and vast amounts of power.This is why many deals are measured not in dollars but in gigawatts (GW).A single gigawatt is a staggering unit:1 GW ≈ the electricity consumption of 750,000 homes.Next-generation AI data centres increasingly require sites of 1–4 GW each. OpenAI’s planned megasite in Texas is expected to consume power on the scale of a small country. These sites need dedicated substations, transmission lines, cooling farms and, in some cases, on-site power generation.Because the capital expenditure is so immense, AI companies need partners that can supply cash and infrastructure. Cloud providers and chipmakers fit the bill but they recoup their investment by locking start-ups into massive, long-term spending commitments.The economics are daunting: McKinsey estimates that meeting global AI compute demand will require $7 trillion in capital expenditure by 2030. Bain has issued similar warnings, noting that the gap between current AI revenue and required future revenue to sustain that expenditure is in the hundreds of billions annually.A simple way to answer whether there is an AI bubble is to start with the generative models themselves. For example, when ChatGPT is asked, “Are we in an AI bubble?” it responds: “Yes, (in the short term).”“Short-term: Yes, there’s over-exuberance. Some of the money is flowing into speculative plays, and not every AI startup will survive,” ChatGPT opined.“Medium to Long-term: Even if there’s a “pop” or correction, I don’t think AI goes away. The infrastructure (data centers, chips, cloud) and real use-cases are likely to persist and mature,” it said in its long term prediction.Elon Musk's Grok agreed that we are in an AI bubble but offered an optimistic view, saying it’s not “the kind that will inevitably end in total catastrophe like the dot-com crash or 2008.”“Yes, I think we're in an AI bubble—though not the kind that will inevitably end in total catastrophe like the dot-com crash or 2008. It's more like a frothy, speculative swell built on genuine technological promise, where valuations have raced ahead of near-term realities, and a correction feels overdue,” Musk’s chatbot said.Gemini described the current moment as a small bubble of investor excitement sitting on top of a much larger, long-term technological shift. In its view, only weaker players and short-term bets are at risk, because the underlying technology remains solid.But to really understand if there is a bubble, weNothing illustrates the speculative scale better than Nvidia. The company’s market capitalisation is now larger than the entire global pharmaceutical industry combined. The comparison is striking:Pharma is a century-old sector with regulated demand, stable revenue and essential products.Nvidia is riding a single theme - AI compute whose long-term commercial returns are still unproven.Investors have embraced the idea that AI will reshape the global economy. But the sheer size of these valuations has led some analysts to warn that even small disappointments in AI adoption could trigger disproportionately large corrections.This is one reason high-profile investors like Michael Burry famous for “The Big Short” have reportedly shorted companies tied closely to the AI boom, including OpenAI-related plays and Palantir. His bearish stance signals that not everyone is convinced the sector can sustain its current velocity.OpenAI reportedly generated around $12 billion in annual revenue. That figure represents enormous traction for an eight-year-old company but its operating costs still exceed its income. Training frontier models like GPT-5 costs billions, and inference expenses (the cost of running the models) rise with user demand.This raises an uncomfortable question:Possibly but at a cost.OpenAI’s mainstream foothold depends heavily on consumer adoption and developer usage. Its subscription tiers, API pricing and enterprise contracts are designed to drive volume, not maximise margin. A significant price hike could slow the growth that its entire valuation depends on.Moreover, the company faces fierce competition: Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, and a rapidly rising open-source ecosystem. In a market shaped by hype and experimentation, raising prices too aggressively risks sending developers elsewhere.Thus OpenAI is caught in the classic innovator’s dilemma:Charge more and risk losing scale, or maintain low prices and burn cash.Oracle might appear an unusual beneficiary of the AI boom but its entanglement with OpenAI is one of the most strategic plays in the industry.Oracle’s cloud business historically lagged behind AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Enter AI: the OpenAI partnership has repositioned Oracle as a critical provider of GPU capacity, filling its data centres with high-margin compute workloads.The $300 billion-plus partnership is effectively a circular loop:The arrangement is lucrative but also risky. If AI growth slows, Oracle could be left with overbuilt infrastructure, echoing the telecom overcapacity of the dot-com era.The parallels with the late-1990s tech boom are more than rhetorical. The mechanism is similar: companies inflated each other’s valuations through investment loops and customer financing schemes.But the more important lesson comes from why the dot-com bubble burst.What killed the dot-com boom was not the failure of the technology, it was the collapse of the financial scaffolding.AI is now building an even bigger, more interconnected one.So far, the AI sector has weathered every potential disruption:In other words: the external shock hasn’t arrived yet.But history suggests that when investment loops are this tightly interwoven, it only takes one disruption, a regulatory hit, a liquidity crunch, an accounting scandal, or a sudden slowdown in AI adoption for the system to reprice violently.In this sense, the AI boom stands at a crossroads similar to 1999–2000: dazzling technological promise intertwined with fragile financial engineering.Circular AI financing is brilliant, aggressive and deeply risky. It has enabled the fastest infrastructure build-out in tech history, compressed into just a few years. But it has also created a tightly coupled financial ecosystem where companies invest in each other, buy from each other and depend heavily on mutual success.If AI delivers the productivity surge its champions predict, the investment loops will look visionary. If it falters, the ouroboros may finally bite too hard and unravel the most expensive technology cycle in a generation.Time, and perhaps an external shock, will reveal which way the loop bends.","A growing number of AI firms and their partners are engaging in ‘circular’ financing, a loop in which the same companies that pour money into AI start-ups are also selling them the infrastructure they need to survive.

US Shutdown ‘Ends’ After 40 Days; Senate Passes Bill After Dems ‘COMPROMISE’ With House GOP | WATCH

The US government will not release official inflation or jobs figures for October after the record-long shutdown prevented statisticians from gathering essential data, leaving the Federal Reserve without two major indicators ahead of its December policy meeting.The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed on Friday that the October consumer price index (CPI) has been cancelled because staff were unable to collect the survey information in time, as per Reuters.“BLS is unable to retroactively collect these data,” the agency said, adding that only a few indexes based on nonsurvey data could be reconstructed. Where possible, October values will be issued alongside November’s CPI report on 18 December.The shutdown—which lasted 43 days from early October to mid-November—also forced the cancellation of the October employment report.While October nonfarm payroll figures will be combined with November data on 16 December, the unemployment rate for that month “will never be known”, reported Reuters.A similar message was delivered in Washington on Friday, with the BLS reiterating that survey-based data simply “was not gathered” during the stoppage, reported news agency AFP.The agency noted that CPI collection typically relies on in-person visits to retailers, including supermarkets, and telephone interviews. Household survey data for the jobs report is gathered in the same way.The cancellations have intensified uncertainty for the Federal Reserve, which meets on 9–10 December.Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently compared navigating the economy without standard datasets to “driving in the fog”, reported The Guardian.“What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” he said last month.Fed officials were already under pressure, with inflation still above typical levels and policymakers weighing whether to deliver another rate cut.A speech by New York Fed President John Williams on Friday added to expectations of a possible adjustment, saying he saw “room for a further adjustment in the near term”, according to The Guardian.The September jobs report, released with delays because of the shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added but the unemployment rate rising to its highest level since 2021.The full October labour market report will never be published, although the job creation figure for that month will appear alongside November’s release a week after the Fed’s meeting.The shutdown has already pushed back a series of economic indicators, including retail sales and trade data, as per AFP.It comes as President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to complicate inflation pressures, with some Fed officials considering holding rates steady for longer.",US government will not release official inflation or jobs figures for October after record-long shutdown.

BENGALURU: The Delaware Bankruptcy Court has entered a default judgment of more than $1.07 billion against Byju Raveendran, after finding that the edtech founder repeatedly failed to comply with court-ordered discovery in the Byju’s Alpha adversary proceeding.A default judgment is a ruling issued when a party does not participate in the litigation or ignores court orders, allowing the court to decide the case without a trial.The ruling, issued on November 20 and reviewed by TOI, awards $533 million in damages for what the court described as fraudulent transfer of Byju’s Alpha’s funds in 2022, and another $540.6 million tied to the transfer of the debtor’s interest in Camshaft Capital Fund, a US hedge fund.The court also ordered Raveendran to provide a “full and accurate accounting” of the Alpha Funds and any proceeds that flowed from subsequent transactions.Judge Brendan Shannon wrote that the relief granted was “extraordinary” but justified, citing what he called an “extensive and repeated pattern of delay and obfuscation.”The order recounts multiple missed deadlines, incomplete filings, non-appearances, and non-payment of earlier sanctions, including a $10,000-per-day fine imposed in July for civil contempt.The adversary case was brought by Byju’s Alpha Inc., the US unit currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, along with GLAS Trust, the loan agent that now controls the debtor.They allege that more than half a billion dollars was “spirited away” from the company and routed through various entities beyond the reach of creditors. Raveendran has denied wrongdoing in earlier filings and has argued that discovery requests were improper or unnecessary; the court rejected those objections.The judgment comes alongside a separate filing earlier this week in which the bankruptcy estate submitted a sworn declaration from UK businessman Oliver Chapman, describing how the disputed funds allegedly moved through his firm, OCI Limited, before being routed to a Singapore entity the debtor claims was linked to Raveendran.That motion seeks court approval for a settlement with Chapman and marks the most detailed account yet submitted to the court on the alleged movement of the Alpha Funds.The defense further claimed that “the monies from the Alpha loans were not used by Byju Raveendran or any founder for their personal gain but were used for the benefit of Think & Learn Private Limited (TLPL).”It alleged that GLAS Trust “has been aware” of this, and accuses the lender-appointed agent of “misleading” the Delaware court.Raveendran’s lawyers added that he and other founders are preparing US federal claims alleging “racketeering and obstruction of justice,” seeking not less than $2.5 billion in damages and said these actions will be filed “before the end of 2025.”",Delaware Bankruptcy Court has entered a default judgment of more than $1.07 billion against Byju Raveendran.

Available employment data from October will instead be released alongside November’s numbers after the meeting, according to AFP.Analysts say the absence of fresh data complicates the central bank’s balancing act between inflation risks and a slowing labour market. A prolonged downturn in hiring could strengthen the case for further rate cuts, while tariff-driven price pressures may argue for a pause.President Donald Trump ’s tariff measures have made bringing inflation down more challenging, prompting some Fed policymakers to signal caution about cutting rates too quickly, AFP noted.","US government will not publish consumer inflation data for October after a 43-day federal shutdown disrupted data collection.

Corporate crypto holdings under pressure

Bitcoin and ether tumbled to multi-month lows on Friday as investors pulled back from riskier assets amid concerns over stretched tech valuations and fading expectations of near-term US rate cuts, Reuters reported.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency , dropped 5.5% to a seven-month low of $81,668, while ether slid more than 6% to $2,661.37, hitting a four-month low.Both tokens have fallen roughly 12% this week, erasing Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains and pulling ether nearly 19% lower for the year.The sell-off comes as volatility spikes across equity markets, particularly high-flying artificial intelligence stocks. Analysts said the retreat signals a broader shift away from speculative assets. “If it’s telling a story about risk sentiment as a whole, then things could start to get really, really ugly, and that’s the concern now,” said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, according to Reuters.The market value of all cryptocurrencies has dropped by about $1.2 trillion in six weeks, CoinGecko data showed. Shares of Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin ETFs from China AMC, Harvest and Bosera fell close to 7% on Friday.Bitcoin’s fall follows a rally earlier this year that pushed it above $120,000 in October, driven by favourable regulatory developments. However, analysts say last month’s record one-day crash — which triggered $19 billion in liquidations — has left sentiment fragile. “The market feels a little bit dislocated, a bit fractured, a bit broken,” Sycamore said, quoted Reuters.Citi analyst Alex Saunders noted that $80,000 is a key level because it is close to the average purchase price of ETF-held bitcoin.The downturn has dragged crypto-linked stocks lower.

(With inputs from agencies)

Japan currently finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the geopolitical front, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s hawkish stance linking Taiwan’s security to Japan’s own has ruffled feathers in Beijing. China has already fired back with economic warnings—from freezing film approvals to squeezing seafood imports—signaling that Tokyo is in a delicate diplomatic bind.But the real storm is brewing at home. In a bid to soothe a public weary of inflation, the government is unleashing a massive stimulus package worth ¥21.3 trillion (roughly $135 billion). While the cash injection might help voters, it’s rattling a bond market that was already on edge. With the Bank of Japan (BoJ) stepping back and interest rates creeping up, bond yields are hitting levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.This marks the end of the ultra-loose monetary policy that defined Japan for decades. Now, analysts are asking the uncomfortable question: Can the world’s most indebted nation manage its towering debt without breaking something in the global financial system?Here is an explainer on why Japan’s bond market has suddenly become the world's biggest worry.Simply put, Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields are breaking out. The 10-year yield recently flirted with 1.8%—a high water mark not seen since 2008—while the 30-year yield pushed past 3.3%. For a country where ""zero interest"" was the status quo for a generation, this is a seismic shift.Why it matters: Japan isn't just any economy; it is the world’s largest creditor nation. Japanese investors have trillions of dollars parked in global assets, from US Treasuries to Australian real estate. If domestic bonds suddenly offer a decent return, that money might pack its bags and head back to Tokyo. This repatriation of capital could drain liquidity from markets like the US and India, causing ripple effects everywhere.Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio has sat around 230% for years without causing a crisis. The difference today is the timing.The government is launching a massive ¥21.3 trillion spending spree to fight inflation exactly when the central bank is trying to stop buying so many bonds. Usually, central banks buy bonds to keep yields low; with the BoJ stepping back, the market has to absorb this new debt, pushing yields up.As Mizuho’s Saori Tsuiki noted, the sheer size of the stimulus sends a risky message. If the market believes the government has lost its fiscal discipline, investors might discount the economic benefits entirely, leaving Japan with just the debt and none of the growth.For decades, shorting Japanese bonds (betting that yields would rise) was nicknamed the ""widow-maker"" trade. Traders who tried it got wiped out because the Bank of Japan had an unlimited checkbook to keep yields at zero.But the widow-maker has finally woken up. Over the last year, the BoJ has:As Bloomberg put it, we are watching a market that was artificially engineered by a central bank trying to learn how to be a ""normal"" market again. The safety net is gone.The carry trade was the financial world’s favorite free lunch. Investors borrowed yen cheaply (because Japanese rates were zero), converted it to dollars, and bought higher-yielding assets like US stocks or Indian bonds.However, as Japanese yields rise, two things happen:This destroys the profit margin of the trade. Investors are now forced to sell their foreign assets to pay back their yen loans—a process called ""unwinding."" This is why a small rate hike in Tokyo can trigger a massive sell-off in the S&P 500.The ""bond vigilantes"" are spotting cracks in the foundation. Recent auctions for long-term bonds (20 to 40 years) have seen weak demand, a clear sign that investors are hesitant to lend to the government long-term.Investors know that defense spending and social security costs are only going up. S&P Global Ratings analyst Rain Yin pointed out that Japan faces undeniable spending pressure on these fronts. If the government has to issue record amounts of debt to pay for it, and there are fewer buyers, yields have nowhere to go but up.If yields keep rising, it creates a nasty feedback loop:Yes, and that is exactly why economists are raising eyebrows.The government claims it is trying to thread a needle—supporting the economy without fueling inflation. But pouring cash into an economy struggling with high prices usually just fans the flames. Yuichi Kodama of Meiji Yasuda suggests this might be political theater: the spending is likely a way for the Takaichi administration to show they care about the public’s struggle, even if it risks spooking the markets.India is in the blast radius. If Japanese yields become attractive, Japanese funds might pull capital out of Indian bonds and equities. Furthermore, as the ""carry trade"" unwinds, global investors tend to go ""risk-off,"" pulling money out of emerging markets to cover their losses elsewhere. This often leads to volatility in the rupee and Indian stock indices.Is this the big crash, or just a return to normalcy? There are three main views:Most analysts expect a mix of all three. But one thing is certain: the days of ignoring Japan’s bond market are over. It has gone from a predictable sleeper to a source of potential global volatility.","Japanese bond yields are hitting levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. The 10-year yield recently flirted with 1.8%, while the 30-year yields pushed past 3.3%. This marks the end of the ultra-loose monetary policy that defined Japan for decades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125489670,imgsize-1350142,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Nvidia chip smuggling: Four charged in US over illegal exports to China; lawmakers urge stricter rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-chip-smuggling-four-charged-in-us-over-illegal-exports-to-china-lawmakers-urge-stricter-rules/articleshow/125488914.cms,"Representative image

Defendants, charges and alleged methods



Legislative response and strategic concerns



The US justice department has charged four individuals in a scheme to illegally export Nvidia AI chips to China, highlighting challenges in enforcing US high-tech export restrictions.The indictment, unsealed Thursday in US district court in Tampa, Florida, accuses two US citizens and two Chinese nationals of conspiring to ship Nvidia GPUs without required licenses, using fake contracts and false documentation to disguise shipments through Malaysia and Thailand.According to court documents, 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs were successfully exported to China between October 2024 and January 2025, while attempts to export 10 Hewlett-Packard supercomputers with H100 GPUs and 50 H200 GPUs were stopped by law enforcement, reported CNBC.The scheme allegedly used a Tampa company, Janford Realtor, as a front for the transactions, funded with nearly $4 million in wire transfers from China.One defendant, Brian Curtis Raymond, 46, from Huntsville, Alabama, is identified as the former CTO of an AI cloud company in Virginia, which confirmed he is no longer employed there, reported CNBC.Raymond, along with co-defendant Mathew Ho (Hon Ning Ho), 34, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, allegedly coordinated the shipments, knowing the chips would ultimately be sent to China.Two other defendants, Jing (Harry) Chen, 45, and Tony Li, 38, both Chinese nationals, are also charged.Charges include conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA), smuggling, and multiple counts of money laundering related to the $3.4–$4 million in wire transfers.Raymond faces seven money laundering counts and additional ECRA violations; Ho faces nine money laundering counts, four ECRA violations, and three smuggling counts.Chen and Li face conspiracy, ECRA violations, and smuggling charges. All four could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.The case has renewed calls from US lawmakers for stricter chip-tracking legislation.John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on China, stressed the need for the bipartisan Chip Security Act, which would mandate chip location verification and reporting of potential diversions.“China recognises the superiority of American AI innovation and will do whatever it must to catch up. That’s why the bipartisan Chip Security Act is urgently needed,” he said, as per Reuters.The indictment underlines the strategic importance of AI and supercomputing chips, which US export curbs aim to prevent from aiding China’s military and technological advancements.The justice department noted that China is actively developing exascale supercomputing capabilities and plans to become a global AI leader by 2030.","The indictment, unsealed Thursday in US district court in Tampa, Florida, accuses two US citizens and two Chinese nationals of conspiring to ship Nvidia GPUs without required licenses.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

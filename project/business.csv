"‘Not a good indicator, what counts is…’: India overtaking Japan to be 4th largest economy no reason to be smug; WEF ex-MD serves reality check",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/not-a-good-indicator-what-counts-is-india-overtaking-japan-to-be-4th-largest-economy-no-reason-to-be-smug-wef-ex-md-serves-reality-check/articleshow/121706941.cms,"For India to achieve its goal of becoming a $ 7-trillion economy by 2030, the country needs to strengthen its industrial sector, according to Smadja. (AI image)

India overtaking Japan to become the fourth largest economy soon is not something to be complacent about, World Economic Forum’s (WEF) former MD Claude Smadja has said. Giving a reality check, Claude Smadja has pointed to India’s abysmal per capita GDP numbers, comparing them to how poorly they fare to Japan’s per capita income.India’s GDP ($4,187 billion) is set to surpass that of Japan ($4,186 billion) by the end of this year (FY26), according to the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report. However, the IMF statistics from April 2025 also reveal that India's GDP per capita stands at $2,878.4, which is roughly 8.5% of Japan's $33,955.7. This means that people in Japan earn approximately 11.8 times more than their Indian counterparts!""Yes, it (economy size) is a good indicator because it gives a notion of the economic weight of the country on the global balance. No, it is not a good indicator because what counts is the per capita GDP. In terms of per capita GDP, India is far below Japan. So whether India has achieved this fourth position in the global economic balance... is a good indicator of progress being made, but it is not in any way any reason for complacency,"" Smadja said in his conversation with PTI.In fact, Smadja emphasised that India's enhanced economic position should drive faster reforms, ensuring improved living conditions across all societal segments, beyond just the expanding middle class in both urban and rural regions.The youthful demographic of India remains a significant advantage, but Smadja highlighted the critical requirement to enhance skill development and retraining across the workforce.For India to achieve its goal of becoming a $ 7-trillion economy by 2030, the country needs to strengthen its industrial sector, according to Smadja.He pointed out that manufacturing's contribution to India's GDP is approximately half of China's level. He considers this proportion inadequate considering India's geographical size, population, and economic capabilities.Without substantial growth in manufacturing activities, India's aspirations to reach the $7-trillion economic milestone remain challenging, according to Smadja.Smadja, who heads Smadja and Smadja Strategic Advisory, spoke of India's crucial position in the global technology landscape. He noted the country's exceptional advantage in big data management, which he believes should be safeguarded and utilised effectively to elevate India's status in worldwide technology and innovation.Also Read | Extreme poverty in India sees sharp decline! Number dips from 344.47 million to 75.24 million; poverty rate down to 5.3%, says World Bank He emphasised that India ranks amongst the primary data producers globally, alongside China, Europe, and the US.According to him, India's unique circumstances stem from its widespread internet connectivity, extensive mobile phone usage, and the national ""Aadhaar"" identification system, resulting in substantial data generation that encompasses all aspects of everyday living.In India, safeguarding this vital strategic resource is crucial as it serves as the foundation for advancing technological innovation, fostering breakthroughs in disruptive technologies, and establishing itself amongst the world's leading big data powerhouses.Besides China, India stands alone in possessing such a substantial big data resource, according to Smadja.","India overtaking Japan to become the fourth largest economy soon is not something to be complacent about, World Economic Forum’s (WEF) former MD Claude Smadja has said.

""Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Oil prices recorded their first weekly increase in three weeks following the announcement.

Mis-selling: RBI looks at tighter rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mis-selling-rbi-looks-at-tighter-rules/articleshow/121740587.cms,"RBI Deputy Governor M. Rajeshwar Rao

MUMBAI: RBI may introduce tighter regulations to curb mis-selling of financial products, especially in cases where customer suitability and appropriateness are overlooked.""It is concerning that such mis-selling without regard to suitability and appropriateness would beget distrust in schemes aimed at providing a safety net,"" said RBI deputy governor Rajeshwar Rao, cautioning that such practices could weaken trust in the formal financial system.To address this, the central bank is considering enhanced disclosure norms, stricter product suitability frameworks, and mandatory audits of sales processes followed by regulated entities. Rao said regulated entities need to ""analyse the gaps and strengthen their processes to reverse the trend"".Speaking at a financial inclusion forum recently, Rao said access to finance should not be treated as charity but as a strategic necessity. ""Financial inclusion should not be viewed as an act of philanthropy, but rather as a strategic investment in the nation's economic and social development,"" he said.""Even lenders having access to low-cost funds have been charging margins higher than the rest of the industry and which in several instances appear to be excessive,"" said RaoRBI is also examining the possibility of mandating product suitability assessments, especially when dealing with vulnerable or first-time users.""It is important that products meant for vulnerable sections are not sold with a 'one-size-fits-all' approach,"" Rao said. He added that financial inclusion should not compromise appropriateness.The surge in consumer complaints, which rose 33% year-on-year, has prompted RBI to consider strengthening grievance redress mechanisms. Rao pointed to the increase in complaints received by the ombudsman and said this called for ""better complaint handling mechanisms, possibly with time-bound resolution and automated complaint tracking."" He indicated that penalties may be introduced for non-compliance with revised grievance norms.On the tech front, RBI may update its guidelines to regulate the use of AI, ML, and blockchain in financial services. Rao said responsible innovation must be guided by principles of fairness, transparency, and data protection. The proposed Unified Lending Interface is expected to move closer to implementation.","RBI may introduce tighter regulations to curb mis-selling of financial products.

Govt weighs more NCLT benches to clear insolvency backlog,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-plans-to-increase-nclt-benches-to-clear-insolvency-case-backlog/articleshow/121740063.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt and the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India have discussed a proposal for a sharp increase in the number of benches of the National Company Law Tribunal from 63 to 80-85. They are also considering adding 150-200 ""special benches"" for four to five years to deal with the backlog in insolvency cases.The law provides for deciding cases within 180 days, which can be extended by another 90 days. In contrast, more than three-fourths of the cases are now taking longer than 270 days, with another 9% taking between 180 and 270 days. At the end of March, only 13% of the 1,194 cases were decided within six months, according to IBBI data. The data also showed that the average time taken has been on an upward trajectory for the last few years.The last financial year saw 259 cases decided, following 263 approvals in the previous year. At this rate, it will take around seven years to clear the pending over 1,900 cases. Last year also saw 723 cases being admitted, which means the number of pending cases will only increase.""We saw that a large part of the year had all the members in NCLT to decide on cases, and approvals are now stabilising around 260-270 annually.But we need to speed up decisions so that the asset quality is preserved for resolution and creditors can also realise more value,"" a source told TOI. One of the reasons for fewer cases coming under the IBC fold last year was healthier bank balance sheets.The proposed ""special benches"" can see members only for a specified period of around five years, and once the case backlog is reduced, the window can be closed, added sources. In any case, the appointment of NCLT members, who also deal with other Companies Act cases, is for a fixed tenure, and the proposal will involve govt adding several more members.Finding such a large number of members in one go can, however, be a challenge, as will be creating infrastructure.","The law provides for deciding cases within 180 days, which can be extended by another 90 days.

'I may move it around a little bit': Donald Trump refuses to sell the red Tesla; calls Musk's Starlink a 'great service',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/i-may-move-it-around-a-little-bit-trump-refuses-to-sell-the-red-tesla-praises-starlink-as-great-service/articleshow/121740986.cms,"All you need to know about the Tesla Model S



US President Donald Trump has dismissed rumours that he plans to sell or give away his red Tesla Model S, saying he might simply “move it around” to a different location instead.Speaking at a White House press briefing on Monday (local time), Trump was asked if he intended to part with the high-profile electric vehicle he purchased on March 11. “Are you going to get rid of your Tesla?” a reporter asked.“No, I may move it around a little bit,” Trump responded.When pressed on where the car might be relocated, Trump responded cryptically, “I have a lot of locations.”Trump also clarified he has no plans to discontinue Musk’s satellite internet venture, Starlink, calling it a “great service.”When asked if he plans to speak with Elon Musk soon, Trump said, “If I were him, I would want to speak to me. Maybe he’s already called. You’d have to ask him.”Relations between the two men have soured in recent weeks after Musk sharply criticised Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” calling it an “abomination” over concerns it would explode the federal deficit.In response, Trump threatened to revoke Musk’s government contracts, prompting Musk to warn that SpaceX could pull its Dragon program in retaliation.Despite the tensions, Trump’s Tesla, originally intended as a symbolic stand against left-wing attacks on Musk’s ventures, remains a visible gesture of support in the White House driveway.The car, which the US President bought on March 11 during a public show was in support for Elon Musk.The high-end Model S, estimated to cost over $100,000, is currently parked in the White House lot for staff use, as the president himself is not allowed to drive under security regulations.The Tesla Model S, launched in 2012, was the company’s first mass-market electric car and remains one of its most advanced vehicles.The Model S stands out with its sleek design, large touchscreen display, and cutting-edge features. It offers both Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability, allowing the car to automatically change lanes, navigate highways from on-ramp to off-ramp, and even park itself.Inside, the car features an optional yoke-style steering wheel, similar to those used in Formula 1, and a rear-seat display for passengers to watch movies or play games.The second-row seating has been redesigned to comfortably seat three adults, offering more legroom, headroom, and a fold-down armrest.One of its key safety features is Sentry Mode, which uses cameras and sensors to monitor the car’s surroundings when parked. If it detects suspicious activity or potential damage, it sends real-time alerts to the owner.With its blend of luxury, technology, and safety, the Model S continues to be one of Tesla’s flagship electric vehicles.","US President Donald Trump has dismissed rumours that he plans to sell or give away his red Tesla Model S.

Government disputes Vijay Mallya claims on loan repayment and outstanding dues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-disputes-vijay-mallya-claims-on-loan-repayment-and-outstanding-dues/articleshow/121734717.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt and banks have called out Vijay Mallya ’s claims of being harassed by lenders despite having cleared their outstanding debts, arguing that the bankrupt businessman still owes a large amount of money to creditors.When the case was filed in the debt recovery tribunal in June 2013, the consolidated non-performing (NPA) outstanding of Kingfisher Airlines was pegged at Rs 6,848 crore, which included non-cumulative redeemable preference shares. Including the accrued interest and other charges of Rs 10,933 crore, according to the DRT decree, the total liability due to the creditors added up to Rs 17,781 crore as of April 10. Against this, banks have recovered Rs 10,815 crore, leaving them with a gap of Rs 6,997 crore, which is yet to be recovered, govt sources said. Mallya claimed that he paid Rs 14,000 crore to banks against loans of Rs 6,200 crore.Any loan comes with interest until the amount is fully paid. In the case of loan defaulters, such as Mallya, there is also a penal interest. The flamboyant businessman, known to live life king-size, seems to have based his claims on clearing the principal, and not the outstanding. The fugitive, who is seeking to block his return to India to face legal action, made similar claims in the past.With Mallya fleeing the country, banks stepped up efforts to recover their dues and were permitted by PMLA courts to sell the property that was attached by enforcement agencies on execution of a bond with the condition that in case of acquittal of the borrowers, the lenders would return the assets. Banks have sold a majority of the properties, including the famous Kingfisher Villa in Goa, and recovered Rs 10,815 crore. Sources said that the recovery process is in line with the board-approved policies of banks.""The norms are uniform irrespective of who the borrower is or from which part of the country or community he or she comes from. So, any allegation or claim made by Vijay Mallya regarding recoveries under any undue influence or under media pressure or due to an inherent bias against him is misconstrued and completely baseless,"" said a source.The loans to Kingfisher, which were restructured by some of the lenders, are also under the scanner with senior executives such as former IDBI Bank chief Yogesh Agarwal also arrested by CBI for alleged irregularities.","Vijay Mallya claimed that he paid Rs 14,000 crore to banks against loans of Rs 6,200 crore.

However, chancellor Rachel Reeves and business secretary Jonathan Reynolds held separate meetings with key figures from both sides.“We are a nation that champions free trade and have always been clear that a trade war is in nobody’s interests, so we welcome these talks,” a spokesperson for the UK government said.","Top US and Chinese officials met in London on Monday in fresh efforts to stabilise the fragile pause in their trade fight.

India-EFTA trade agreement: Deal set to kick in by September; $100 billion investment incoming in 15 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-efta-trade-agreement-deal-set-to-kick-in-by-september-100-billion-investment-incoming-in-15-years/articleshow/121733506.cms,"The much-awaited free trade agreement between India and the four-nation European bloc EFTA is expected to come into force by September this year, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal announced on Monday.The trade and economic partnership agreement (TEPA), signed on 10 March 2024, marks a significant milestone in India’s trade diplomacy. Under the deal, India has secured a commitment of $100 billion in investments over the next 15 years from the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which comprises Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.Speaking to reporters during his official visit to Switzerland, Goyal confirmed, “By September, TEPA will be operationalised. It will enter into force by September.”The agreement has already been cleared by the Parliaments of all four EFTA countries, with an objection window in Switzerland open until 10 July, the minister said, cited by PTI.The agreement is expected to slash or eliminate import duties on a range of European goods, including Swiss watches, chocolates, and cut and polished diamonds, benefiting Indian consumers and industries alike.During his visit, Goyal engaged with leaders and business representatives, holding one-on-one discussions with over a dozen Swiss firms. He said most companies expressed strong interest in investing in India. Swizz companies, especially, have shown interest in sectors like pharmaceuticals, cybersecurity, and machinery manufacturing.“Lots of excitement here for India,” Goyal said.During his bilateral meetings, he also encouraged companies to hold their board meetings in India, allowing them to witness the country's investment potential firsthand.He noted that 100 per cent foreign direct investment is permitted in machinery manufacturing in India, which could help reduce the country’s reliance on machine imports from China.The minister also offered an update on other trade negotiations, stating that India is in active discussions with New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Oman, and the European Union. A deal with the EU could be concluded “faster than expected,” he hinted, alongside a possible finalisation of a bilateral investment treaty.Reflecting on the 11-year tenure of the NDA government, Goyal said FTAs have played a crucial role in positioning India as a top destination for global investment.“The world today recognises that the best place to do business is India,” he said. “India is also a preferred destination for services.”He highlighted the growing presence of global capability centres (GCCs) in India, with nearly 2,000 already established. On manufacturing, he pointed to the success of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which has boosted local content in air conditioner manufacturing from 20 per cent to 65 per cent.All of this has been made possible because of the “good governance” of the last 11 years, he said.","The trade and economic partnership agreement (TEPA), signed on 10 March 2024, marks a significant milestone in India’s trade diplomacy.

Inflexion will retain a minority share, while L’Oreal has secured the option to eventually buy out all remaining shareholders, Reuters reported.“We are delighted to welcome Medik8 to the L’Oréal family. As a premium skincare range, with high levels of proven efficacy at an accessible price point, Medik8 perfectly complements our existing skincare portfolio,” Cyril Chaupuy, president of L’oreal Luxe said.“This acquisition further strengthens L’Oreal’s luxe portfolio, adding a premium science-backed skincare brand with a proven track record of success, with strong potential for global growth,” the company said in a statement.L’Oreal will begin consolidating Medik8’s sales once the transaction officially closes. The acquisition is expected to be finalised in the coming months, pending regulatory approvals and standard closing conditions.Simon Coble, CEO of Medik8 also expressed excitement on the brand’s behalf.“I am delighted to be joining forces with a company which shares our vision for the brand’s future growth and whose core values align with our deep commitment to science, innovation and above all, results without compromise. I look forward to the next stage in Medik8’s journey, as we work together to bring our innovative products to a wider audience.”Founded in the UK, Medik8 has built a loyal customer base with its vitamin A-focused anti-ageing creams and serums.

Amazon's Pennsylvania investment: 2 data centres worth $20 billion; One taps directly into nuclear power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazons-pennsylvania-investment-2-data-centres-worth-20-billion-one-taps-directly-into-nuclear-power/articleshow/121732372.cms,"Why the scrutiny over the Susquehanna plant?

Amazon on Monday announced a $20 billion investment to develop two data centre complexes in Pennsylvania, adding to the billions of dollars that Big Tech’s have already poured into the state’s booming data centre industry.The e-commerce giant is planning to construct one data centre next to Susquehanna nuclear power plant, but the plan is now under federal investigation due to concerns over the company drawing power directly from the facility.The other is planned just north of Philadelphia, Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon Web Services told AP on Monday.The Pennsylvania investment follows a string of similar commitments by Amazon this year, with $10 billion each pledged for data centre projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina, marking an aggressive expansion as tech giants vie for dominance in the AI era.As cloud computing and AI continue to grow rapidly, the demand for data centers is also surging as the technologies require significant power to operate servers, storage systems, networking gear, and cooling infrastructure.The data centre near the Susquehanna plant stands out not just for its scale but for the way it plans to tap into power.In a deal struck last year, Talen Energy, majority owner of the nuclear facility, sold its adjacent data centre to Amazon for $650 million.The agreement would allow Amazon to access up to 960 megawatts of electricity, approximately 40% of the plant’s output, sufficient to power over 500,000 homes.However, the unique “behind the meter” arrangement, which enables Amazon to plug directly into the plant without routing through the broader power grid, has triggered the attention of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This is the first case of its kind to come before the agency.Regulators are now examining whether such setups unfairly allow large tech firms to bypass grid fees and if prioritising high-paying corporate users could jeopardise energy availability for others.","The e-commerce giant is planning to construct one data centre next to Susquehanna nuclear power plant, but the plan is now under federal investigation.

While those tariffs are currently paused, hopes for a breakthrough have helped fuel a powerful rally on Wall Street in recent weeks.One of the key drivers behind the S&P 500’s rebound, now within just 2.5% of its all-time high, is speculation that the US President Donald Trump may ease tariffs if fresh trade deals are secured.

These talks come after a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week.Zichun Huang of Capital Economics anticipated exports growth to revive in June, thanks to a 90-day suspension on most of the tariffs the two countries have imposed on each other.China’s imports also fell in May, down 3.4% year-on-year, leaving the country with a trade surplus of $103.2 billion. Exports to the US totalled $28.8 billion, a steep decline from $44 billion a year ago. Imports from the US also slid 7.4%, to $10.8 billion.The drop in US-bound shipments was offset to some extent by strong export growth to Southeast Asia and the European Union. Shipments to those regions rose 14.8% and 12% respectively, with notable gains in trade with Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Germany.“The acceleration of exports to other economies has helped China's exports to remain relatively buoyant in the face of the trade war,” said Lynne Song, an economist at ING, quoted by AFP.Analysts say many businesses had front-loaded orders earlier in the year to avoid tariffs, temporarily boosting numbers. But as those import duties began to take effect, exports slowed.Meanwhile, tensions between Washington and Beijing have extended beyond tariffs. Disagreements over high-tech semiconductors, critical rare earth minerals, and even student visas continue to drive a wedge between the two powers.President Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Friday that Xi had agreed to resume rare earth mineral exports to the US, an assertion yet to be confirmed by Chinese authorities. Customs data show the value of rare earth exports dropped nearly 21% in the first five months of the year, though volumes ticked up slightly by 2.3%.Domestically, Chinese markets are also suffering. Consumer prices fell 0.1% in May, while producer prices dropped 3.3%, the sharpest decline in nearly two years.As both sides prepare to sit down in London, hopes for a breakthrough remain cautious. While the tariff truce has bought time, the path to a durable resolution appears fraught with challenges far beyond customs duties.","China's export growth lost momentum in May, rising 4.8% year-on-year, a sharp slowdown from the 8.1% surge recorded in April.

What JPMorgan’s letter says to new recruits

Jamie Dimon’s past warnings

Led by CEO Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan has issued a very stern warning to ‘unethical’ junior bankers who start looking at alternate job offers within 18 months of joining. A new letter, leaked on Litquidity's Instagram platform, warns the new recruits against job hopping.According to the letter, junior bankers securing alternative employment opportunities during their initial 18-month tenure risk immediate termination from JPMorgan amidst increasing competition for skilled professionals in Wall Street.The confidential correspondence to newly recruited JPMorgan analysts explicitly states that securing employment elsewhere would result in immediate dismissal from the bank, according to a New York Post report.""If you accept a position with another company before joining us or within your first 18 months, you will be provided notice and your employment with the firm will end,"" states the correspondence dated June 4, bearing signatures of JPMorgan's global banking co-heads Filippo Gori and John Simmons, the report said.The communication from both senior leaders emphasised that complete dedication and engagement are vital for achieving success in the investment banking analyst programme.Also Read | Donald Trump vs Elon Musk: Who has more to lose - US President or world’s richest man?

Microsoft and Nvidia, both valued above $3 trillion, maintained weights of 6.9% and 6.8% in the S&P 500 as of Thursday.Despite a slight recovery on Friday, Thursday's sharp fall weighed heavily on major US indexes, with Tesla alone accounting for nearly half the day’s declines.The company's decline made up nearly half of the day's losses for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, which fell 0.5% and 0.8% respectively.The S&P 500 is widely seen as the key benchmark for the US stock market, while the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 underpins the popular Invesco QQQ ETF.""It's a widely held stock,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth told Reuters.""When this big-name company that represents a sizable portion of the index sells off, it has an overall effect on the index, but it also has a psychological effect on investors,"" Pavlk added.The situation highlights long-standing concerns about index concentration in a small number of large-capitalisation stocks.The ""Magnificent Seven"", including Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, collectively represented nearly one-third of the S&P 500's total weight as of Thursday's close.Though Tesla is the smallest among these tech and growth giants, it played a major role in driving index gains in 2023 and 2024.While 2025 started off uncertain, recent trends suggest signs of recovery.Tesla shares have dropped around 37% since mid-December, while the S&P 500 has fallen just 1% in the same period—reducing Tesla’s overall influence on the index.Tesla is included in about 10% of the roughly 4,200 ETFs, giving it wide market exposure, according to Todd Sohn, ETF and technical strategist at Strategas. Some major funds affected include the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, which fell 2.5% on Thursday, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which declined 2.6%.""It's very important to know holistically what is in all your ETFs, because a lot of them are overlapping,"" the analyst noted.","Tesla shares fell 14% on Thursday after Donald Trump threatened to cut off government contracts to Elon Musk's companies.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

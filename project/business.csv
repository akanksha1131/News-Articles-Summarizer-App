'Largest' tax refunds? How much cash will actually hit Americans’ bank accounts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/largest-tax-refunds-how-much-cash-will-actually-hit-americans-bank-accounts/articleshow/125923537.cms,"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt

How much each Americans will get?



Americans, you can rejoice as your wallet just got good news, even before the world gets its hands on GTA 6.On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Americans can expect an extra amount in their bank accounts in the months ahead, all because of Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed into law in July.Leavitt told reporters, “Americans can expect another boost in their bank accounts in the months ahead.” She added that 2026 tax refunds are “projected to be the largest ever thanks to President [Donald] Trump’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”Citing analysis from investment bank Piper Sandler, Leavitt said refunds “could be about one-third larger than usual, or roughly an extra $1,000 per filer.”On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that working Americans would receive “very large refunds” next year, amounting to about $1,000 to $2,000 per household. He said the increased refunds were a direct result of the tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.The cost of living has been a central concern for many Americans in recent months. Democrats have criticised the Trump administration over affordability issues, while Republicans have backed the president’s tax legislation as delivering relief.In an X post on December 4, the White House said, Largest tax refund season in American history.Thanks to extended tax cuts and retroactive tax relief provided by the Working Family Tax Cuts.Representative Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvanian Democrat, said in a December 9 X post, Trump called the cost-of-living crisis a ‘con,’ but now he’s in Pennsylvania claiming he’s lowering costs. His empty promises are the real con — and Pennsylvanians aren’t buying it. This is the same guy raising prices with his tariff taxes and taking health care from Americans.House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a December 10 X post, This is a LIFE-CHANGING boost for America’s children. And remember: Nearly EVERY Democrat voted to block this from happening.Taxes are due on April 15-2026. Americans typically receive their tax refunds within weeks of filing.","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that 2026 tax refunds are “projected to be the largest ever thanks to President [Donald] Trump’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.” She said refunds “could be about one-third larger than usual, or roughly an extra $1,000 per filer”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125923620,imgsize-892020,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-22.jpg"

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold futures on MCX witnessed a sharp rally overnight, touching highs near ₹1,32,610 before encountering resistance and slipping lower in early trade. The momentum indicators now suggest overbought conditions, and prices are showing signs of exhaustion near the upper band. This keeps the intraday bias vulnerable to a corrective move if support levels fail to hold. A sell signal activates below ₹1,32,300, with defined risk and clear downside potential.The price has extended significantly above both short-term moving averages, indicating a stretched rally. EMA 8 is steep but beginning to flatten, a common early sign of momentum cooling. A break below ₹1,32,300 would shift prices back toward the EMA cluster, reinforcing bearish pressure.Gold is trading at the upper Bollinger band after a vertical rise. This suggests price overextension, and a move below the mid-band could accelerate selling toward the lower volatility zone.RSI is at 72.7, firmly in the overbought territory. This level often precedes corrective pullbacks, especially when combined with slowing price momentum.MACD remains positive, but histogram bars are shrinking, indicating weakening bullish strength. A downward crossover in the next few sessions is possible if price slips below key support.Failure to hold ₹1,32,300 will expose the lower pivot levels, increasing the probability of a corrective slide.Gold’s intraday technical structure points toward a possible pullback from overbought levels. Bears may regain control if the price slips below ₹1,32,300, opening room toward ₹1,31,700. Traders should maintain strict risk parameters with a stop-loss at ₹1,32,750.","Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship for individuals and corporations willing to make large financial contributions.Announcing the rollout on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""The United States Government’s Trump Gold Card is here today! A direct path to citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. So exciting! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""A website accepting applications went live soon after, as Trump unveiled the program in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, joined by business leaders.Trump said the funds raised through the initiative would ""go to the US government,"" adding that the program could generate ""billions"" for the Treasury Department ""where we can do positive things for the country.""""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government.... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even,"" he told reporters further talking about the initiative.The Trump Gold Card is a new US visa-residency programme that costs $1 million for individual applicants. The Trump Gold Card programme effectively provides a pathway to permanent legal residency, similar to a green card but, as Trump claims, ""with big advantages.""""It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States…"" Trump added.It is intended to replace the existing EB-5 investor visa programme, subject to vetting by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The card resembles a luxury credit card, featuring a gold background along with Donald Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with ""Trump Gold Card"" embossed on the left.The Trump Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor one or more foreign employees. Corporations must pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS fee per employee, and the programme requires a $2 million gift per sponsored employee after vetting is completed.Companies can apply for multiple employees simultaneously.A notable benefit of the corporate version is that companies may stop sponsoring one employee and use the same previously paid $2 million contribution to sponsor a new employee without paying another gift amount.""The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small, 1% annual maintenance fee and a 5% transfer fee, which includes the cost of a new DHS background check. Small additional fees to the US Department of State may also apply depending on each employee’s circumstances, the website noted.Individual applicants must make a one-time, non-refundable $1 million gift, whereas corporate sponsors pay $2 million per employee. Both require the same DHS processing fee of $15,000.Applicants must first pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS processing fee. Once the vetting process is complete, the required $1 million ""gift"" from an individual (or $2 million for a corporation per applicant) serves as proof that the applicant will ""substantially benefit the United States.""Additional small fees may be charged by the US Department of State depending on individual circumstances. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for petition approval and visa adjudication will take place on an expedited basis, assuming applicants submit any additional documents or fees in a timely manner.The $15,000 processing fee can be paid by credit card or ACH (US accounts only). The $1 million or $2 million contribution must be sent via ACH debit or SWIFT wire transfer after vetting.For Visa-related fees - The applicant will receive information directly from the US Department of State on how to submit the visa application fee and payments for the required medical examination.Like other American permanent residents and citizens, Trump Gold Card holders are required to pay US taxes, including on income earned outside the United States.Applicants must be eligible for lawful permanent resident status, admissible to the United States, and have a visa available under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories.Yes. Spouses and unmarried children under 21 can be included in the initial application. Each family member must pay an additional $15,000 DHS fee and a $1 million gift, with the same expedited processing benefits.""This will ensure that these family members receive all of the privileges conferred by the Gold Card Program, including expedited processing,"" the website said.Yes. Since the Trump Gold Card functions as a visa, it can be revoked on grounds of national security concerns or significant criminal activity.Here is the simplified step-by-step process, based on the details provided on the Gold Card website:The programme promises an expedited timeline, with processing expected to take a few weeks, provided applicants respond promptly to interview requests and document submissions, the website said.The upcoming Trump Platinum Card will allow individuals to live in the US for up to 270 days a year without paying US tax on non-US income, eliminating the need for additional travel visas.It is priced at $5 million, plus the $15,000 DHS fee, and has not yet been launched. A waitlist has opened, and applicants are being encouraged to secure their place early.The design for the Trump Platinum Card has not yet been revealed, but the website encourages users to join a waitlist, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.The website warns that the $5 million Platinum Card contribution ""may not remain"" at the current price, leading many to join the waitlist early.""Foreign nationals can sign up now and secure their places on the waiting list for the Trump Platinum Card. When launched, and upon receipt of a $15,000 DHS processing fee and $5 million contribution, they will have the ability to spend up to 270 days in the United States without being subject to US taxes on non-US income,"" the website added.The Platinum Card cannot be obtained by anyone who has previously been subject to US tax on foreign income, such as ""US citizens or resident aliens,"" they said.The Trump Gold Card comes with several limitations that raise questions about its accessibility and long-term impact. Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the new programme has no job-creation requirement for investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also made no mention of annual caps, leaving uncertainty around oversight, scalability and how the scheme fits into broader US immigration policy.For businesses, the card does not guarantee lower costs. Each corporate card applies to only one employee, meaning expenses rise with every additional hire. Companies needing to retain multiple foreign-born graduates may end up paying millions.This makes the programme more suitable for wealthy individuals or well-funded corporations, offering little relief to smaller firms facing talent shortages.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship.

Rupee hits new record low: Currency weakens to 90.46 versus US dollar; RBI likely intervened to stem fall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-hits-new-record-low-currency-weakens-to-90-46-versus-us-dollar-rbi-intervention-likely/articleshow/125907270.cms,"Rupee versus dollar (AI image)



RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

The Indian rupee tanked to a fresh record low on Thursday, going past the 90 mark versus the US dollar again. The rupee has been depreciating sharply this year, influenced by ongoing challenges on the India-US trade deal front and increased corporate dollar demands.The rupee declined to 90.4675 versus the US dollar, surpassing its previous historic low of 90.42 recorded on December 4.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reportedly stepped in on Thursday to prevent further depreciation of the rupee's value, five traders were quoted as saying by Reuters.The rupee has declined over 5% against the dollar in 2025, ranking as the third-poorest performer amongst 31 primary currencies, with only the Turkish lira and Argentina's peso showing greater losses. This downward trend is significant, coming at a time when the dollar's strength measure has reduced by more than 7%.Several elements contribute to the rupee's negative performance, including growing trade deficits, hefty 50% US tariffs on Indian goods, and outward foreign capital movement. The lack of successful negotiations with the Donald Trump administration has further weakened the currency's position.The currency continues to experience pressure after falling past the crucial 90 mark, which is 50% of its 2011 value.This situation creates additional difficulties for RBI governor Sajay Malhotra and central bank officials in their efforts to maintain balance between rupee flexibility and market steadiness, while steering clear of past financial issues.India's capital controls restrict the rupee's convertibility, requiring RBI's participation in both domestic and international markets for intervention. In global markets, rupee trading occurs primarily through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), which are derivatives contracts setting exchange rates with dollar settlements.The RBI implements interventions via the Bank for International Settlements, working alongside selected major banks as trading partners in continuous markets operating across Singapore, Dubai and London.","The Indian rupee tanked to a fresh record low on Thursday, going past the 90 mark versus the US dollar again.

Benchmark indices traded in a range with corrective bias and is currently placed around 25,900 levels as domestic markets tracked the global risk-off tone, pressured by persistent FII selling, a softer rupee, and ongoing uncertainty around US–India trade talks. In the short term, market direction will hinge on central bank commentary and clarity on trade-related developments.In the near term, market trajectory is likely to be dictated by currency stabilization dynamics, especially whether the rupee can find a durable floor. Moreover, clarity on evolving India–US trade negotiations could influence sector-specific outlooks, particularly in export-linked and tariff-sensitive industries.Nifty has key support placed at 25,700–25,800, which aligns with the bullish gap from November 12, the 50-day EMA, and a key retracement zone of the prior uptrend. Sustaining this band will be crucial for continuing the positive momentum of the last 3 months.We expect the Nifty to consolidate in the range of 25,700–26,200. A clear breakout or breakdown will determine the next directional move.A close below the key support area of 25,700 will signal extension of the corrective decline towards the 100 days EMA placed around 25400 levels.On the higher side, a move above the recent swing high of 26,200 will signal extension of the rally towards 26,500 levels in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty traded in a range, digesting its recent strong gains. The index consolidated in a 700-points range oscillating in a positive and negative territory.We expect the index to extend consolidation and form a base in the range of 58500-60100 in the coming sessions.A follow-through strength above recent high 60,100 will open further upside towards 61,000 levels in the coming weeks.The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels. Key support is placed at 58,300-58,600 levels being the confluence of the last two weeks lows and recent breakout area. Holding above the support area will keep the short-term bias positive.Eternal has been in a corrective phase over the past two to three months and is now consolidating around a major demand zone. This technical setup points to a favorable risk-reward profile, suggesting the potential for a bullish reversal and a rebound from its current oversold levels.The current corrective phase seems to be losing momentum, with price action hinting at a possible rebound toward the ₹323 area in the coming months. This zone aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire drop from ₹368 to ₹280 and also matches the November 2025 high, strengthening its significance as a major resistance level.The stock is at the cusp of generating a breakout above a falling channel signaling resumption of up move thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock has already taken 6 weeks to retrace just 50% of its preceding 5 weeks rally (5636-6904). A shallow retracement signals a higher base formation and an overall positive structure.We expect the stock to head towards 6850 levels being the trendline resistance joining the highs of July and November 2025.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stocks to buy for December 12, 2025 are Eternal, and Divi's Laboratories.

"Stablecoins unstable, pose major fin risks: RBI deputy governor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stablecoins-unstable-pose-major-fin-risks-rbi-deputy-governor/articleshow/125943707.cms,"RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

MUMBAI: RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar on Friday said that stablecoins are inherently unstable and pose major macro-financial risks, including currency substitution, dollarisation and weakened monetary-policy transmission.Sankar's comments come at a time when US govt's stance is broadly supportive of dollar-denominated payment stablecoins as part of the formal financial system, distinct from lightly supervised cryptocurrencies. While stablecoins are also cryptocurrencies, they are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the dollar, a commodity such as gold or a basket of assets.Speaking at the annual BFSI conclave on Friday, Sankar said that ""stablecoins fail to satisfy the two defining features of modern money, viz., one, money as fiat and two, singleness of money. It is possible that in a stablecoin system, there would be hundreds, or more, of currencies in an economy making any such system inherently unstable.""Sankar said that stablecoins ""lack the basic attributes of money"" and could weaken India's monetary and financial architecture if allowed to gain traction. Stablecoins, he said, are ultimately ""private money"", not fiat, and therefore do not carry the sovereign backing that underpins trust in modern currency.He questioned whether stablecoins even constitute the liability of their issuers, noting that ""neither of the two major cryptocurrencies in use today make such unconditional promise"" to redeem at par. Their much-touted advantages - faster cross-border transfers, broader financial inclusion and better links to the real economy - are, he said, largely unproven. Domestic systems like UPI already offer ""fast, low-cost and reliable payments"", while stablecoins remain mostly confined to facilitating ""trading and leverage within the crypto market itself"". Their dependence on smartphones, digital wallets and connectivity further undermines claims of expanding inclusion.The deputy governor warned that widespread stablecoin adoption could trigger currency substitution and dollarisation, reducing demand for the local unit. It would also weaken monetary-policy transmission, impair capital-flow management and divert deposits away from banks, thereby raising funding costs and forcing greater reliance on central-bank liquidity. These effects, he said, would compound systemic vulnerabilities, leaving traditional policy tools less effective.He said that stablecoins do not serve a purpose that cannot be fulfilled by fiat money. ""The bigger threat is a stablecoin that works well.""","RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar on Friday said that stablecoins are inherently unstable and pose major macro-financial risks.

'India is a key partner': US lawmakers urge to scrap 50% tariff; warn of economic fallout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-is-a-key-partner-us-lawmakers-urge-to-scrap-50-tariff-warn-of-economic-fallout/articleshow/125943168.cms,"Representative image (AI)

High-Stakes Modi-Trump Call Attempts To Repair Ties Strained By US Tariffs, Russia Energy Policies

In a significant acknowledgement of India’s growing economic importance to the United States, three members of the US House of Representatives have moved to roll back steep tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on Indian imports, arguing that the measures hurt American jobs, consumers, and the broader US-India partnership.The resolution, introduced by Congresswoman Deborah Ross and Congressmen Marc Veasey and Raja Krishnamoorthi, seeks to terminate Trump’s national emergency declaration that led to tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian goods. The move follows a bipartisan effort in the US Senate to curb the President’s use of emergency powers to impose punitive trade measures.According to the lawmakers, the resolution aims to withdraw the additional 25 per cent “secondary” tariffs imposed on India on August 27, 2025, which were stacked on earlier reciprocal duties, pushing levies on several Indian-origin products to 50 per cent under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).""North Carolina's economy is deeply connected to India through trade, investment, and a vibrant Indian American community,"" said Congresswoman RossIndian companies, she noted, have invested more than $1bn in the state, generating thousands of jobs in high-growth sectors such as life sciences and technology, while US manufacturers export hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of goods to India each year.""India is an important cultural, economic, and strategic partner, and these illegal tariffs are a tax on everyday North Texans who are already struggling with rising costs,"" Congressman Veasey added.Echoing these concerns, Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi stated that the duties imposed on Indian imports are ""counterproductive, disrupt supply chains, harm American workers, and drive up costs for consumers."" He emphasised that removing the tariffs would strengthen economic engagement and deepen US-India cooperation in both trade and security.""Instead of advancing American interests or security, these duties disrupt supply chains, harm American workers, and drive up costs for consumers. Ending these damaging tariffs will allow the United States to engage with India to advance our shared economic and security needs,"" Krishnamoorthi added.""Ending Trump's India tariffs is part of a broader effort by congressional Democrats to reclaim Congress's constitutional authority over trade and to stop the President from using emergency powers to unilaterally impose his misguided trade policies,"" the release stated.Earlier in October, Ross, Veasey and Krishnamoorthi, along with Congressman Ro Khanna and 19 other lawmakers, had urged the President to reverse the tariff measures and repair relations with India.The tariffs were imposed in August, when Trump announced a 25 per cent duty on Indian goods starting August 1, followed by another 25 per cent hike days later, citing India’s continued purchases of Russian oil, a move that drew criticism from lawmakers who argue the decision undermined US economic interests and a vital partnership with New Delhi.","Three members of the US House of Representatives have moved to roll back steep tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on Indian imports.

Auto dispatches hit top gear: November clocks double-digit sales growth — What's driving the surge?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/auto-dispatches-hit-top-gear-november-clocks-double-digit-sales-growth-whats-driving-the-surge/articleshow/125943335.cms,"Automakers saw a strong rise in factory dispatches to dealerships in November, indicating that consumer demand remained strong even after the festive season ended. Companies noted that cars, two-wheelers and three-wheelers recording strong double-digit growth as compared to the same period, a year earlier.Industry body SIAM said that the month turned out to be a record-breaking one for the sector. “Passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers marked the highest ever sales of November in 2025,” Rajesh Menon, director general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, told ET. According to him, the performance was aided by “support from the government's progressive GST 2.0 reforms.”Retail trends largely mirrored wholesale activity.Data compiled by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations showed that registrations of passenger vehicles and three-wheelers, considered a proxy for retail sales, stayed broadly aligned with dispatches from manufacturers.Two-wheelers, however, bucked the trend. Registrations in the segment slipped 3% year on year to 2,546,184 units in November, compared with 2,627,617 units a year ago, while month-on-month sales dropped 19%.Dealers said the strong rise in wholesales was partly driven by manufacturers ramping up inventory at showrooms in anticipation of demand during the marriage season. According to ET, FADA attributed the slowdown in two-wheeler registrations to heavy buying in October during the festive period, delays in crop payments and uneven supply of popular models.Despite the short-term weakness, FADA president CS Vigneshwar expects a revival in two-wheeler demand, citing a robust harvest and the onset of the wedding season as key triggers.Leading carmakers reported robust performances during the month. Maruti Suzuki said November was the best in its four-decade history. “Our sales last month is the highest ever we have seen for the month of November in the last 40 years (since starting operations),” said Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer, marketing and sales, at Maruti Suzuki. “Our retail sales rose by 31%. For eight of our models, we have no vehicles for dispatch in our factories,” ET cited the official.The company said sales of small cars, under four metres in length and taxed at 18%, rose 38% year on year, while sales of larger vehicles, which attract a 40% tax, increased 17%. Maruti Suzuki currently has pending bookings of around 150,000 units, with dealer inventory at about 120,000 units.Banerjee said production teams are working through holidays to reduce waiting periods and ensure timely deliveries, adding that the company expects the sales momentum to carry into December.Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra also reported strong growth, with both automakers posting a 22% increase in volumes to 57,436 units and 56,336 units respectively.Looking ahead, Menon said the industry remains upbeat about the months ahead. “Industry is optimistic that the continued supportive policy reforms and improved market sentiments would continue this growth trajectory well into 2026.”","Industry body SIAM said that the month turned out to be a record-breaking one for the sector.

J&J’s talc trouble continues: Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $40 million in baby powder cancer case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jjs-talc-trouble-continues-johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-40-million-in-baby-powder-cancer-case/articleshow/125943232.cms,"A California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $40 million to two women who claimed its talc-based baby powder caused their ovarian cancer. The women testified that decades of use led to major surgeries and chemotherapy. Johnson & Johnson plans to appeal, stating the verdict is aberrant and lacks evidence.





A California jury on Friday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $40 million to two women who said decades of using the company’s talc-based baby powder led to their ovarian cancer.Kent was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014, and Schultz was diagnosed in 2018. Both California residents said they used J&J’s baby powder after bathing for 40 years. Their treatments involved major surgeries and dozens of rounds of chemotherapy, they testified at the trial, Reuters reported.In closing arguments viewed on Courtroom View Network, Andy Birchfield, an attorney for the women, told the jury, “Absolutely they knew, they knew and they were doing everything they could to hide it, to bury the truth about the dangers.”Allison Brown, an attorney for Johnson & Johnson, said, “They don’t have the evidence in this case, and they hope you don’t mind.” She argued that no major US health authority backs the alleged connection and no study shows talc can migrate from the outside of the body to the reproductive organs.Erik Haas, Johnson & Johnson’s worldwide vice president of litigation, said in a statement the company plans to “immediately appeal this verdict and expect to prevail as we typically do with aberrant adverse verdicts.”Johnson & Johnson is facing lawsuits from more than 67,000 plaintiffs who say they were diagnosed with cancer after using its baby powder and other talc products, according to court filings. The company says its products are safe, do not contain asbestos and do not cause cancer. J&J stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the US in 2020, switching to a cornstarch product.J&J has sought to resolve the litigation through bankruptcy, a proposal rejected three times by federal courts, most recently in April. The bankruptcies had put most cases on hold. Brown and Kent’s cases are the first to go to trial since the latest Chapter 11 attempt was dismissed.Before the bankruptcy attempts, J&J had a mixed record in talc trials, with verdicts as high as $4.69 billion awarded to women who said baby powder caused their ovarian cancer. The company has won some trials outright and had other verdicts reduced on appeal.The majority of lawsuits involve ovarian cancer claims. Cases alleging talc caused a rare and deadly cancer called mesothelioma make up a smaller portion of the claims J&J is facing. The company previously settled some of those claims but has not struck a nationwide settlement, so many lawsuits over mesothelioma have proceeded to trial in state courts in recent months. In the past year, J&J has been hit with several substantial verdicts in mesothelioma cases, including one for more than $900 million in Los Angeles in October.","Johnson & Johnson plans to appeal, stating the verdict is aberrant and lacks evidence.

Brookfield bets $1 billion for GCC in Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brookfield-bets-1-billion-for-gcc-in-mumbai/articleshow/125943110.cms,"Brookfield

MUMBAI: New York-based alternative asset manager Brookfield is lining up investments worth over $1 billion (around Rs 9,000 crore) to set up a global capability centre (GCC) in Mumbai, raising its bets on India.The GCC, which will be Asia’s largest, is being developed through an agreement between Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and a venture led by Brookfield along with its partner (B S Sharma), the company said in a statement on Friday. The six-acre project, which will come up in Powai, is scheduled to be completed by 2029 and is estimated to create more than 30,000 jobs. The development will house the largest GCC for a marquee multinational bank spanning a 20-year term, Brookfield said.GCCs are essentially offshore units of multinational corporations (MNCs) — they are strategically set up in regions which have efficient cost structures and a vast talent pool allowing companies to build specialised capabilities around AI and R&D. India which houses over 1.9 million professionals with expertise in AI, engineering and product spaces is fast emerging as one of the world’s GCC hotspots, said analysts at Zinnov.Between early 2024 and late 2025, nearly 110 new GCCs came up in India. While US-based companies still lead the pack, firms from the UK, Germany, Japan and Denmark have also broadened their presence in India over the last couple of years, a trend driven more by India’s capabilities.MNCs ranging from Samsung, Microsoft, JP Morgan Chase and Bosch have poured several dollars to build GCCs in India. Expansion of GCCs has emerged as one of the key growth drivers for India’s commercial office real estate sector in recent years, ratings agency ICRA said.Brookfield is one of the largest office owners and operates in India with nearly 55 million square feet across seven cities in India. Earlier this year, Brookfield had signed a memorandum of understanding with MMRDA to bring in $12 billion of investments into the Mumbai metropolitan region. In June 2025, it acquired a 2.1 acre parcel in Mumbai’s BKC to create a high-quality mixed-use property. Brookfield owns over $4 billion of real estate projects in Mumbai.“The new GCC policy we announced earlier this year, builds on this momentum and is designed to attract large-scale, high-value operations that generate skilled employment and long-term economic growth,” Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said. India’s GCCs — about 92% are currently based in six cities including Mumbai, NCR, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.","Brookfield is lining up investments worth over $1 billion to set up a global capability centre (GCC) in Mumbai.

Mukesh Ambani: School and college

Gautam Adani: Learning by doing

Two ways to reach the top

Who has a better education background?

Lessons for young professionals

When we talk about business in India, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani come up in every conversation. Their companies touch everything from energy to ports, from telecom to infrastructure. People track their every move, their deals, their investments, and the headlines make it look like their success was inevitable. But there is one part of their story that doesn’t get much attention: how they learned to run businesses in the first place. Ambani went through formal schooling and college before stepping into the family business. Adani left school early and learned by doing, managing trade and operations from a young age. Looking at how they learned, what shaped their early decisions, and how their education, formal or practical, set the stage for their empires tells a lot about the different ways people can prepare for big challenges.Mukesh Ambani was born on April 19, 1957, in Aden, which is now part of Yemen. His family returned to India when he was still a baby. He did his primary schooling at Scindia School, Gwalior, and completed his senior secondary education at Hill Grange High School in Mumbai along with his brother Anil.After school, he went to St. Xavier’s College in Mumbai and then earned a Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology. He joined an MBA program at Stanford University, but left in 1980 to help his father with Reliance Industries . His education gave him a base in technical knowledge and exposed him to teachers and mentors who made him think about problems differently.Those lessons came in handy when he oversaw projects like the Jamnagar refinery and later, the expansion of Reliance into telecommunications and digital networks.Gautam Adani was born on June 24, 1962, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. He went to Sheth Chimanlal Nagindas Vidyalaya school, but left at 16. College was not part of his story. He moved to Mumbai as a teenager to work as a diamond sorter, and that’s where he got his first taste of business.By 1981, he returned to Ahmedabad to manage his elder brother’s plastics business. That experience taught him how imports, exports, and supply chains worked. It also became the starting point for the Adani Group , which he founded in 1988. Adani learned on the job. Every decision, every risk, and every deal was a lesson. There were no books or classrooms. The challenges themselves became the school, and the lessons stuck.Ambani and Adani took very different paths, but both led to the same destination: running massive businesses with influence across industries. Ambani’s education was structured, giving him knowledge, guidance, and a way to approach problems. Adani’s learning was direct and hands-on. He had to figure things out while they were happening.Formal education gives frameworks and networks. Experiential learning builds judgment and the ability to adapt quickly. Ambani combined both. Adani relied entirely on experience. Both worked, and both created businesses that dominate their sectors.It depends on how you look at it. Ambani’s education is impressive in a traditional sense—engineering from a top institute, exposure to an international MBA program, and structured learning. Adani’s is impressive in a different way—he learned fast, took responsibility, and built a business empire without formal training. Their stories show there is no single route to success.Ambani and Adani show two sides of the same coin. Ambani highlights the value of structured education and mentorship. Adani highlights the value of initiative and learning by doing. Both show that knowledge is important, but what matters more is how you use it. Students and young professionals can take one clear message from their journeys: learning never stops, and opportunities to learn come in many forms.","Mukesh Ambani went through formal schooling and college before stepping into the family business.

The agreement aims to assess the feasibility of digitising Pakistan’s assets — including government bonds, treasury bills, commodity reserves and other federally owned holdings — through blockchain platforms.According to the ministry, the proposed collaboration seeks to “enhance liquidity, transparency and international market accessibility,” with any move subject to Pakistani laws, policies and regulatory approvals. The MoU is non-binding, sets no exclusivity, and does not amount to a procurement commitment. Definitive agreements, if pursued, will be negotiated within six months.Officials said the arrangement could allow Binance and its affiliates to provide technical expertise, advisory support, training and capacity building to help Pakistan evaluate compliant blockchain infrastructure that can attract global investors while ensuring full sovereign control.Calling the MoU a major signal of the government’s reform direction, Aurangzeb said, “This is a very strong message — not only for Pakistan, but for the entire world. What we have signed today reflects a long-term partnership… The next step for us is execution, and we are fully committed to delivering results with speed and quality.”Advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council Changpeng Zhao, who was present at the signing, termed the development “a landmark” for Pakistan’s financial future. “This is a great signal for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan… now we can move towards full deployment and execution,” he said, expressing confidence that the collaboration would have “positive and lasting outcomes for the economy.”The ministry added that the initiative marks a key milestone in aligning Pakistan’s financial ecosystem with global best practices at a time when tokenisation is gaining traction worldwide.Separately, the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) said it has issued No Objection Certificates to Binance and HTX, launching a phased, FATF-aligned route toward full licensing. “Strong governance, AML and CFT compliance remain central as Pakistan builds a trusted digital asset ecosystem,” PVARA said on X.The authority said Pakistan has taken a “decisive step” toward a regulated digital-asset framework by entering formal arrangements with Binance and HTX.","Pakistan signs MoU with global crypto exchange Binance to explore tokenisation of sovereign and real-world assets of up to $2 billion.

US compliance alert: New York warned of $73M fund loss; federal audit flags improper immigrant commercial licences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-compliance-alert-new-york-warned-of-73m-fund-loss-federal-audit-flags-improper-immigrant-commercial-licences/articleshow/125937827.cms,"Photo credit- AP

The US Transportation Department has warned New York that it could lose $73 million in federal highway funds after an audit found thousands of immigrant commercial driver’s licences (CDLs) were allegedly issued without proper verification, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Friday, AP report.Duffy said federal investigators reviewed 200 non-domiciled commercial licences and found more than half had been issued improperly, including several that defaulted to an eight-year validity period regardless of when the applicant’s work authorisation expired. He also said New York could not demonstrate immigration-status verification for roughly 32,000 active licences in this category and, in some cases, issued CDLs despite applicants’ work permits already having lapsed.“When more than half of the licences reviewed were issued illegally, it isn’t just a mistake — it is a dereliction of duty by state leadership. Gov. (Kathy) Hochul must immediately revoke these illegally issued licences,” Duffy said. New York has 30 days to respond to the findings.The New York Department of Motor Vehicles rejected the allegations. DMV spokesperson Walter McClure said: “Secretary Duffy is lying about New York State once again in a desperate attempt to distract from the failing, chaotic administration he represents.Here is the truth: Commercial Drivers Licenses are regulated by the Federal Government, and New York State DMV has, and will continue to, comply with federal rules. ”Duffy has launched a nationwide audit of immigrant CDL issuance following a fatal Florida crash involving a driver who was not authorised to be in the US. So far, only states led by Democratic governors have been warned of potential sanctions, though Duffy insisted the effort is not political and is focused on preventing unqualified drivers from operating heavy trucks and buses.The Transportation Department has already pressured California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota, where audits uncovered similar issues, prompting California to revoke 17,000 licences. A separate federal rule that sought to sharply restrict eligibility for noncitizens to obtain CDLs has been put on hold by a court.Immigrants constitute around 20% of US truck drivers, although non-domiciled licence holders account for only about 5% of CDL holders nationally.",US Transportation Department warns New York it could lose $73 million in federal highway funds.

"US rental aid update: Section 8 landlord payments resume after shutdown delay; $1,500 checks begin rolling out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-rental-aid-update-section-8-landlord-payments-resume-after-shutdown-delay-1500-checks-begin-rolling-out/articleshow/125934567.cms,"Section 8 payments delayed but now restarting

How much landlords typically receive

FAQs

Q1. When will Section 8 landlord payments be sent out?

Q2. Why were the $1,500 landlord payments delayed?

Americans are being advised to monitor their bank accounts as landlord subsidy payments of up to $1,500 under the Section 8 rental assistance programme begin to roll out, following delays triggered by the recent federal government shutdown, according to an ET report.The payments, formally known as Housing Assistance Payments, support low-income households, seniors and people with disabilities by covering a portion of their rent, The Sun reported.Under the Housing Choice Voucher Programme, tenants typically contribute about 30% of their adjusted monthly income toward rent and utilities, while the remaining portion is paid directly to landlords by the local Public Housing Authority (PHA). Earlier this month, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) warned PHAs that December disbursements would be delayed due to the temporary shutdown-induced funding disruption.In New York City, the housing authority confirmed that it has now received the required December funds and will begin issuing payments. “Following notice from HUD that payments to Section 8 landlords would be delayed this month, NYCHA is happy to report that it has now received full funding from HUD and will promptly process payments,” the agency said in a statement.Created under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1978, Section 8 allows eligible low- and moderate-income families to rent homes in the private market. Tenants typically do not pay more than 40% of their adjusted monthly income toward their share of rent, as cited by The Sun. The PHA then issues the Housing Assistance Payment to the landlord, covering the gap between the tenant’s contribution and the contract rent.NYCHA said: “NYCHA’s Section 8 payments to landlords are contingent on federal funding, with the Authority serving as a pass-through for Housing Assistance Payments. It is NYCHA’s standard procedure to pay its Section 8 landlords as soon as is reasonably practicable following its receipt of funding from HUD.” The authority expects to begin sending out December’s payments on Monday, December 8.The Housing Assistance Payment varies depending on the tenant’s income, the rent level and the size of the unit. In New York, the typical subsidy ranges between $1,200 and $1,500 per month per unit, with the average at $1,466 as of November 2024 data from the New York State Comptroller. Landlords of larger or higher-rent units may receive higher amounts.While NYC landlords await their Section 8 payments, The Sun also reported that families in other states have begun receiving a one-time $750 holiday support payment. Another recent case highlighted a couple who bought a four-bedroom home using a “free money” housing grant that does not require repayment, with similar programmes available for other eligible applicants.Payments will begin going out from December 8, after HUD released the delayed funds.They were delayed due to the temporary federal government shutdown, which disrupted HUD’s December funding cycle.","Payments will begin going out from December 8, after HUD released the delayed funds.

The TerraUSD scam: South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon faces 15 year jail time; what was the 'epic fraud'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-terrausd-scam-south-korean-entrepreneur-do-kwon-faces-15-year-jail-time-what-was-the-epic-fraud/articleshow/125930611.cms,"Do Kwon, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur once celebrated for building the TerraUSD and Luna digital tokens, is now beginning a 15-year stretch in a US federal prison.But how did the South Korean businessman ended up with a jail sentence?The 34-year-old, who co-founded Singapore-based Terraform Labs and promoted his coins as stable, innovative and built for turbulent markets, returned to a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday to hear the punishment for a collapse that upended the crypto world. Prosecutors said he repeatedly misled investors, concealed the real mechanisms supporting his projects, and set off a chain reaction of losses across the industry.US district judge Paul A Engelmayer, sentencing him in New York, delivered a scathing assessment of the damage left behind. “This was a fraud on an epic, generational scale. In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have, Mr. Kwon,” he told the packed courtroom, further describing the crime as an ""epic fraud.""Kwon, dressed in yellow prison clothes, acknowledged the weight of the letters submitted by hundreds of investors who described losing their savings, futures and financial security when TerraUSD and Luna imploded. “All of their stories were harrowing and reminded me again of the great losses that I’ve caused. I want to tell these victims that I am sorry,” he said, as cited by Reuters.One of those victims, Ayyildiz Attila, said he had lost between $400,000 and $500,000. “My savings, my future, and the results of years of sacrifice disappeared. I struggled to keep up with payments and responsibilities, and everything I had worked for was erased,” Attila wrote.Kwon had earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud, admitting that he misled investors about how TerraUSD regained its $1 peg in 2021. “I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm's role in restoring that peg,” he said at the time. “What I did was wrong.”Prosecutors said the restoration of the peg was not due to the “Terra Protocol”, the algorithm Kwon publicly cited, but through secret purchases by a high-frequency trading firm that had been arranged behind the scenes. They had urged the court to impose at least 12 years in prison, arguing that the crash triggered billions in losses and stirred turmoil across the crypto market. His lawyers had asked for no more than five so he could eventually return to South Korea, where he also faces charges.The January indictment listed nine criminal counts, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. In 2024, Kwon and Terraform also agreed to a $4.55 billion settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, requiring him to pay an $80 million civil fine and barring him from crypto activity, Reuters reported.After the sentencing, his lawyer Sean Hecker said his client had spoken “from the heart”, expressed genuine remorse and hoped to continue making amends. US attorney Jay Clayton called Kwon’s conduct a calculated effort: he “devised elaborate schemes” to inflate token values and “fled accountability when his crimes caught up to him”.Under Kwon’s plea agreement, prosecutors will not oppose his request to be transferred abroad after serving half of his US sentence, but for now, the former crypto star faces a long spell behind bars.","Do Kwon, 34, sentenced to 15 years in a US federal prison.

Trump sanctions hit! Russia records lowest oil exports since Ukraine conflict; revenue falls to $11 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-eu-sanctions-hit-russia-records-lowest-oil-exports-since-ukraine-conflict-revenue-falls-to-11-billion/articleshow/125929247.cms,"Trump Turns Up Heat On Zelensky, Warns Of WW3; 'Give Me Security,' Demands Ukraine President

Urals crude prices plunge



Impact of Ukrainian strikes and Russia’s “shadow fleet”



Russia’s budget under strain



US escalates pressure with tariffs and sanctions



Global supply slips

Outlook — What will happen in the oil sector?



Russia’s oil exports crashed to their lowest point since the Ukraine war began, weighed down by buyers moving away from Moscow amid tightened US sanctions and Kyiv’s escalating attacks. In its latest assessment, the International Energy Agency (IEA) noted that Russian oil exports declined by 420 kb/d in November, pulling total shipments down to 6.9 mb/d.The drop in volumes and weakening prices pushed Moscow’s oil revenue down to $11 billion, which is $3.6 billion less than the same month last year. The IEA added that both export volumes and prices have dropped, “dragging export revenues to their lowest since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.”As exports dragged down, Urals crude prices also tumbled by $8.2/bbl to $43.52/bbl (one barrel is about 159 litres). This marked the lowest level since the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.According to the IEA, this downturn pushed export revenues to their lowest monthly level since the invasion began.The IEA said Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s sanctions-busting “shadow fleet” and marine oil facilities cut almost half of Russia’s November seaborne exports through the Black Sea.The pressure on shipments and prices comes as Russia struggles with meagre economic growth, the accumulated impact of sanctions and Ukrainian strikes on its energy infrastructure.Ukraine intensified strikes on Russian refineries over the summer and early autumn, causing domestic petrol prices to spike and prompting some Russian regions to introduce fuel rationing.""After weathering significant unplanned refinery outages in November, tightness in refined product markets has eased, but sanctions in 1Q26 will provide fresh challenges,"" the IEA said.The Russian finance ministry reported that oil and gas revenues for the first nine months of the year were down 22% to $88 billion.A combination of high military spending, entrenched inflation and falling oil income has stretched Moscow’s budget. Russia is expected to post a $50 billion deficit this year, around three percent of GDP, and plans to raise taxes on consumers and businesses next year to narrow the gap.The United States has warned several countries that they may face additional tariffs and punitive trade measures if they continue buying Russian oil. The EU hasWashington recently imposed an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, citing its continued purchases of Russian crude. This was on top of the 25% tariff previously announced by US President Trump.In October, the US unveiled some of its toughest measures yet on Russia’s energy sector by sanctioning Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two biggest oil producers, in an effort to pressure Moscow to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine.Global oil supply fell by 610 kb/d in November, extending cumulative declines from September’s record high of 109 mb/d to 1.5 mb/d, the IEA said.OPEC+ accounted for more than three-quarters of the overall drop, driven mainly by sanctions-hit Russia and Venezuela. The group contributed 80% of the supply decline over the past two months, reflecting major unplanned outages in Kuwait and Kazakhstan, alongside continued contractions in Russia and Venezuela.Among non-OPEC+ producers, the United States, Brazil and biofuels were also contributors to the global supply decline.Despite recent market tightness, the IEA projects global oil supply to grow by 3 mb/d in 2025 and a further 2.4 mb/d in 2026. However, the agency revised its supply growth forecasts downward, by 100 kb/d for 2025 and 20 kb/d for 2026 — to 106.2 mb/d and 108.6 mb/d respectively.On the demand front, world oil consumption is expected to rise by 830 kb/d in 2025, supported by improved macroeconomic and trade conditions. The IEA has also upgraded its 2026 demand outlook to 860 kb/d, an increase of 90 kb/d from earlier estimates.Gasoil and jet/kerosene are projected to account for half of this year’s demand growth, while fuel oil continues to lose ground due to substitution by natural gas and solar in power generation.","IEA: Russian oil exports declined by 420 kb/d in November, pulling total shipments down to 6.9 mb/d.

IMF slaps Pakistan with 11 more conditions! $7 billion bailout on line; total regulations stand at 64,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/imf-slaps-pakistan-with-11-more-conditions-7-billion-bailout-on-line-total-regulations-stand-at-64/articleshow/125928432.cms,"IMF’s New Conditions Expose Pakistan’s Deep Economic Faultlines Amid $7 Billion Rescue Package

Here are what some of the conditions focus on:

Corruption



Cross-border payments



Bond market



Sugar industry



Tackling FBR's poor efficiency



Tax reforms



Power sector in focus



The International Monetary Fund hit Pakistan with 11 fresh conditions, linked to its $7-billion bailout programme. The latest directives, revealed in the Fund’s staff-level report for the second review released on Thursday, push the total number of conditions to 64 across the span of 18 months, according to the Express Tribune.The new measures target long-standing governance flaws, entrenched corruption risks and losses in critical sectors. A key requirement is the publication of asset declarations of high-level federal civil servants by December next year on an official government website. The IMF says the disclosures are meant to help detect discrepancies between income and assets.The government intends to extend this obligation to senior provincial officials as well, while banks will be granted full access to the data.The report states that by October next year, Islamabad must release an action plan to tackle corruption risks in 10 departments identified through institutional risk assessments. The National Accountability Bureau will be responsible for coordinating these plans for the most vulnerable agencies. According to The Express Tribune, provincial anti-corruption bodies will also take on expanded functions, including receiving financial intelligence and gaining continued support to improve their ability to investigate financial offences.These steps follow the IMF-backed Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment, which highlighted wide-ranging deficiencies in Pakistan’s legal, administrative and oversight frameworks.The lender has further directed Pakistan to complete by May next year a comprehensive review of the cost of foreign remittances and the structural barriers affecting cross-border payments, supported by an action plan. The instruction comes amid estimates that remittance costs could climb to $1.5 billion over the next few years, even as these inflows remain the country’s largest source of financing for its restricted imports.Another requirement, due by September next year, obliges the government to examine obstacles limiting the development of the local currency bond market and to publish a strategic plan outlining needed reforms.In an attempt to dismantle the concentration of power in the sugar sector, both federal and provincial administrations must agree on a national sugar market liberalisation policy by June next year. The federal cabinet is expected to adopt the policy, which must cover licensing rules, price controls, permissions for imports and exports, zoning criteria and clear timelines for implementation.The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), frequently criticised for poor performance, has been handed a demanding set of tasks. By the end of December this year, the government must complete a reform roadmap that outlines priority areas, staffing needs, timelines, milestones, expected revenue outcomes and KPIs. Based on this roadmap, Pakistan will then be required to fully implement all necessary steps, such as subordinate legislation, staffing changes and initial reporting, across at least three priority reforms agreed with IMF staff.By December next year, the authorities must also publish a medium-term tax reform strategy setting out a phased plan that covers tax policy, tax administration and legal amendments, as well as governance and resourcing arrangements.The government, before the next federal budget, must establish the groundwork for private-sector participation in HESCO and SEPCO and conclude public service obligation agreements with the seven largest power entities. Legislative work is also expected: amendments to the Companies Act, 2017 must be tabled in Parliament to strengthen compliance requirements for unlisted firms and modernise corporate governance. Separately, the government must issue a concept note outlining the aims, expected outcomes, reasons for change and KPIs for proposed amendments to the SEZ Act, according to The Tribune.The IMF report also records Pakistan’s commitment to introduce a mini-budget if revenues fall short by the end of December 2025. If triggered, the measures would include increasing federal excise duty on fertilisers and pesticides by 5%, levying excise duty on high-value sugary products and widening the sales tax net by moving selected goods to the standard rate.Additionally, the IMF has extended Pakistan’s deadline to publish the action plan addressing the weaknesses flagged in the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic reports.","The International Monetary Fund hit Pakistan with 11 fresh conditions, linked to its $7-billion bailout programme.

US Indian-origin lawmakers have raised concerns that measures undertaken by the Trump administration, such as the USD 100,000 fee on H1B visas and 50 per cent tariffs on India, were hurting American businesses and threatening people-to-people ties between Washington and Delhi.The remarks came during a House Foreign Affairs South and Central Asia Subcommittee hearing titled ‘The US India Strategic Partnership: Securing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific’.US Representative Ami Bera, addressing the hearing, highlighted “the strong bipartisan support” the US-India partnership has received by the Congress and various White House administrations over decades PTI reported.“It's clear our interest, from the Congressional perspective and the administration perspective, is a closer relationship, both our economic interests, our geopolitical strategic interests, to create an atmosphere of security, peace, prosperity that both the Indian people want, that we also want,” Bera said.Bera added that the announcement of the USD 100,000 fee on H1B visas “hurts American companies, disadvantages our companies.”He also said that visuals of Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping do ""cause some heartburn for folks in Congress.”Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said the tariffs announced by the Trump administration “are damaging India's economy and also hurting American businesses and consumers.”On the intensive crackdown on immigration, Jayapal said Trump has “threatened"" people-to-people ties by “shutting down legal pathways to immigrate, reminiscent of a legacy of discriminatory quotas that made it extremely difficult for Indians to immigrate in the first place.”Recalling that she is the only member of Congress to have been on both a student visa and an H1B visa, Jayapal said she deeply understands the “harms of those policies, and I'm committed to making sure that we continue to provide strong legal pathways for people to come to this country from India as well as around the world.”She also voiced concern about the “anti-Indian hate that has been rising in the United States,” underscoring that Indian-Americans are extremely important to the US economy, “an integral part of our society, running major Fortune 500 companies as well as startups, and leading cutting-edge research to save lives.”The hearing also heard from Jeff Smith, director of the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation; Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America; and Sameer Lalwani, external senior advisor at the Special Competitive Studies Project and senior fellow in the Indo-Pacific programme at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.",US Indian-origin lawmakers have raised concerns that measures undertaken by the Trump administration are hurting American businesses and threatening people-to- people ties between Washington and Delhi.

Rough November for Elon Musk's Tesla: US sales sink to nearly 4-year low; cheaper EV versions fail to spark demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rough-november-for-elon-musks-tesla-us-sales-sink-to-nearly-4-year-low-cheaper-ev-versions-fail-to-spark-demand/articleshow/125925496.cms,"‘Standard’ models fail to attract buyers



Dealing with backlash



Tesla’s latest attempt to revive demand in the United States faltered in November, with the company posting its weakest monthly sales in nearly four years, despite rolling out cheaper versions of its most popular electric vehicles. Exclusive figures shared with Cox Automotive, cited by Reuters show that US sales fell to about 39,800 units, a sharp drop from 51,513 a year earlier and the lowest level since January 2022.The decline comes at a critical time for Tesla, which relies on its new budget “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3 to attract customers. Introduced in October, priced roughly $5,000 below the earlier base models, the lower-cost options were expected to soften the blow of the Trump administration’s decision to scrap the $7,500 EV tax credit at the end of September.At the same time, the company is also focusing on robotaxis and humanoid robots, projects that have helped sustain its $1.4 trillion market value.The cheaper models have, however, not delivered the anticipated boost. According to Cox, which tracks industry-wide sales, November’s total fell nearly 23% year-on-year. Analysts say the drop suggests the new variants have not attracted enough incremental buyers.“The drop certainly shows there is not enough demand for the Standard variants that were supposed to boost sales after the tax credit expiry,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights.“What’s also happening is Standard sales are cannibalizing into sales of Premium versions, especially the Model 3.”Most electric carmakers saw an even steeper impact from the end of federal credits, with overall US EV sales sliding more than 41% in November. A notable detail is that Tesla, despite its own slump, was able to grow its market share to 56.7% from 43.1% a year earlier.Tesla’s slowdown extends a broader trend: deliveries fell last year for the first time after a run of rapid growth, pressured by high interest rates, subdued consumer sentiment and increasing competition, particularly from cheaper models in China and Europe. Analysts expect another fall this year, with Tesla’s lineup largely limited to older models and minor updates. Its most recent new product, the Cybertruck, has struggled to find a sizeable customer base.“Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,” Streaty said. “So the answer is that Tesla needs a completely new vehicle in its fleet. Period.”The company has also been dealing with reputational setbacks linked to CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, including his work for US President Donald Trump and far-right statements that have triggered protests and affected its image.To entice buyers, Tesla has begun offering 0% financing on the Standard Model Y, according to its US website. Both the Standard Model Y and Standard Model 3 were also listed in inventory with reduced prices. Analysts say the move underscores the pressure to stimulate demand.“I think the bottom line is, if the demand was there they wouldn't be offering 0% financing,” Shawn Campbell, an adviser at Camelthorn Investments told Reuters.“The solution for the demand issue ultimately needs to be new, fresh models.”","US sales fell to about 39,800 units, a sharp drop from 51,513 a year earlier.

The Dow rose 1.3%, driven by strong gains in banks and industrial stocks, while the S&P 500 also pushed into record territory, ending at 0.21% gain. The rally followed an upbeat session in Europe and a mixed day in Asia, with global markets continuing to respond positively to the Fed’s less hawkish tone on Wednesday (local time).But the Nasdaq’s 0.3% dip highlighed the market’s lingering nerves around AI-linked valuations. The Nasdaq, however, was weighed down by a sharp slump in Oracle shares that reignited long-standing worries about the soaring cost of artificial intelligence bets.""Even as investors were reassured by the Fed's latest rate cut, familiar concerns about AI are still very much top of mind right now,"" Deutsche Bank managing director Jim Reid told AFP.The concerns resurfaced after Oracle revealed late on Wednesday that its quarterly revenue had fallen short of expectations and that it had ramped up spending on data centres to expand AI capacity.The stock sank 10.8% by the close, having earlier fallen even further.Dave Grecsek of Aspiriant Wealth Management said the reaction highlighted the market’s discomfort with the scale of AI-related investments.""There's still a lot of apprehension about how sustainable some of these capital spending plans are, what the return on those investments are, and especially now that they're financed with debt,"" he said, as cited by AFP.Last month, global markets briefly faltered as investors were cautious by the AI bubble concept, questioning whether the massive sums flowing into artificial intelligence risked inflating a bubble that could eventually burst.The Fed’s rate cut, its third in a row, was anticipated, but an unusually high number of dissenting votes has clouded expectations over where borrowing costs are headed next.""Investors have shrugged off the Fed's latest reduction in US borrowing costs as it is becoming harder to guess where rates might go next,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.Fed officials remain split on the outlook for 2026, including whether more cuts will be needed and how many. Still, eToro US analyst Bret Kenwell noted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed out that none of the policymakers foresee rate hikes in 2026 in their baseline scenario.""The lack of an outright hawkish tone from the Fed combined with its third consecutive rate cut could pave the way for a potential year-end rally in equities, provided that next week's macroeconomic data doesn't derail the recent bullish momentum,"" Kenwell said.The reduction brings interest rates to their lowest level in three years as policymakers attempt to shore up a labour market that has shown signs of strain throughout 2025.The dollar weakened while oil prices slipped following the decision.Among corporate movers, Disney added 2.4% after unveiling a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI, giving users the ability to create short AI-generated videos featuring popular Disney characters.","The Dow rose 1.3%, driven by strong gains in banks and industrial stocks.

NEW YORK: After three consecutive interest rate cuts, investors now confront an uncertain US monetary policy outlook for the year ahead, clouded by persistent inflation, data gaps, and an impending leadership change at Federal Reserve.The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter-percentage point on Wednesday in an uncommonly divided vote, but signaled it would likely pause further reductions in borrowing costs as officials look for clearer signals about the direction of the job market and inflation that ""remains somewhat elevated"".The Fed's projection for a slower easing path contrasts with market expectations for two 0.25% cuts in 2026, which would bring the fed funds rate to about 3.0%. Policymakers see only one cut next year and one in 2027. Wednesday's cut brought the policy rate to a range of 3.50%-3.75%.The central bank's updated projections showed six policymakers preferring no rate cut this year, and seven anticipating no further cuts in 2026.How monetary policy evolves from here will hinge on economic data that is still lagging from the impact of the 43-day federal govt shutdown in Oct and Nov. This comes as the US heads into a midterm-election year likely to focus on economic performance, with President Donald Trump urging sharper rate reductions.""I think the guessing game of what the Fed does next is going to be getting a lot more difficult next year,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.","The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter-percentage point on Wednesday in an uncommonly divided vote.

Cyber resilience core to sovereignty: Satya Nadella,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/cyber-resilience-core-to-sovereignty-nadella/articleshow/125920974.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized cyber resilience as crucial for sovereignty, warning that isolation from global threat intelligence creates vulnerabilities. He highlighted AI's role in evolving software development and announced significant AI partnerships in India, underscoring a new era of innovation driven by data and multi-model reasoning for enhanced decision-making.

BENGALURU: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has insisted that cyber resilience must be an essential pillar of any strategy surrounding sovereignty. He cautioned that autonomy without access to global threat intelligence can create vulnerabilities.While countries are increasingly building sovereign data infrastructure, and mandating that local data remains within the country's borders, Nadella noted that cyber threats can come from any part of the world, and it is important for sovereign infrastructures to be open to the global intelligence around these threats.Nadella, who was here on Thursday as part of the Microsoft AI Tour, argued that cybersecurity today is fundamentally ""a signals game, an intelligence game"", making it vital that nations and enterprises benefit from global threat visibility. He urged leaders to view sovereignty and resilience not as competing priorities but as a single risk equation. Microsoft, he said, gives govts and enterprises a range of choices across public, private, and sovereign cloud offerings.Nadella also announced strategic partnerships with Cognizant, Infosys, TCS and Wipro to accelerate the adoption of agentic AI.Each of these companies will deploy over 50,000 Microsoft Copilot licenses-collectively surpassing 200,000 licenses-and setting a new benchmark for enterprise-scale AI adoption.This comes a day after Microsoft committed $17.5 billion in investment in India, focusing on AI infrastructure, skilling, and sovereign capabilities, marking Microsoft's biggest investment anywhere in Asia.Nadella also underscored that the next era of innovation will be defined by a fundamental shift in how developers build solutions. He stressed that technology must advance outcomes, not innovation for its own sake. The classic SDLC (software development lifecycle), he said, has to evolve into a new form of AI-driven SDLC. Data, he noted, becomes the core of this shift. ""When we talk about context engineering, it's a little bit of good old data engineering. .. where you want to get your data into the shape that allows you to feed it to the intelligence and then orchestrate around it.""Nadella spoke about the value of the AI LLM Council, a decision-making framework inspired by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy's idea, where multiple large language models-including GPT, Gemini and DeepSeek-act as ""council members"". A chair model then synthesises their collective reasoning.Nadella illustrated this with an example: asking the council to select an all-time Indian cricket XI. The models agreed on legends like Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Kapil Dev, R Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah, while debating choices such as VVS Laxman and Anil Kumble versus Zaheer Khan.Nadella described this multi-model debate as ""a chain of debate, not a chain of thought""-a glimpse into the next generation of metacognition, where AI agents contribute to human decision-making by reasoning, disagreeing, and synthesising outcomes.",Satya Nadella: Cyber resilience must be an essential pillar of any strategy surrounding sovereignty.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

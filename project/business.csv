India’s GDP growth outlook trimmed to 6.3% as private investment stalls and US tariffs loom: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-gdp-growth-outlook-trimmed-to-6-3-as-private-investment-stalls-and-us-tariffs-loom-report/articleshow/120613489.cms,"AI-generated image

India’s economy is expected to grow at a slower pace in the current fiscal year, weighed down by subdued private sector investment and uncertainty surrounding American tariffs, according to a Reuters survey of economists.The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in FY2024 -25, based on a poll conducted from April 15-24 with participation from 54 economists. While this matches last year’s growth, it marks a slight downgrade from the 6.5 per cent forecast in a March survey. It still remains marginally above the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent projection of 6.2 per cent.However, this represents a significant drop from the 9.2 per cent GDP growth recorded in fiscal year 2023–24, highlighting a slowdown in momentum.Economists say the headline figures mask deeper structural issues, including the economy’s inability to generate enough high-paying jobs for its growing youth population. Despite government-led infrastructure investments, private sector capital expenditure has remained stagnant over the past decade, leaving India operating below its potential.The situation is further complicated by the proposed 26 per cent US tariff on Indian imports - currently suspended for a 90-day window starting April 10 — which has raised concerns despite India’s services-heavy exports to the US.“Middle-class Indians are struggling. Residential building sales, passenger vehicles, and two-wheeler sales have declined. It’s important that domestic policies address the root causes,” said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Société Générale.“India needs a 1991 moment,” he added, referencing the landmark liberalisation campaign led by then-finance minister Manmohan Singh. “The tariff war offers a perfect opportunity to push for structural reforms. Without them, even as the fastest-growing large economy in a low global growth environment, India may fall well short of its long-term ambition to become a developed nation.”In the survey, most economists said US tariffs have had a negative or severely negative impact on business sentiment. Some described the effect as neutral.“Business sentiment has certainly taken a hit — no business wants to make investment decisions in an uncertain and volatile environment. Investment is the most adversely affected component of the economy due to trade tariffs,” said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India.She added that sectors previously poised for growth — including renewables, refineries, steel, and cement — may now scale back or delay capital expenditure plans.Meanwhile, with concerns of a potential US recession and India’s consumer inflation staying below the 4 per cent medium-term target for two straight months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to continue its moderate rate-cutting cycle. The central bank is likely to reduce rates by 25 basis points in June to 5.75 per cent, and possibly conclude the easing cycle in August at 5.50 per cent, according to the survey.“The unexpected drop in inflation... has created greater scope for monetary policy support to growth,” noted Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.For FY2024–25, consumer inflation is projected to average 4.0 per cent, rising slightly to 4.3 per cent in the following fiscal year.This report based on Reuters survey comes days after the World Bank revised its prediction on India's growth to 6.3 per cent for FY 2025-26, cut from its previous estimate of 6.7 per cent.According to the report, as quoted by news agency PTI, ""In India, growth is expected to slow from 6.5 per cent in FY2024-25 to 6.3 per cent in FY 2025-26, as the benefits to private investment from monetary easing and regulatory streamlining are expected to be offset by global economic weakness and policy uncertainty.""The organisation's assessment indicates that India's current fiscal performance fell short of projections, primarily due to reduced private sector investments and unfulfilled public capital expenditure objectives.Read more: World Bank cuts India’s FY26 growth forecast to 6.3% citing global headwinds","The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in FY2024 -25, based on a poll conducted from April 15-24 with participation from 54 economists.

Key policy changes announced:

Any impact on Indian Markets?

The Pakistan Stock Exchange tanked on Thursday, following India's implementation of stringent diplomatic sanctions against Pakistan in response to the Pahalgam terror incident that resulted in 26 people being killed.The KSE-100 index registered a substantial fall of 2.12%, equivalent to 2,485.85 points, reaching 114,740.29 in initial trading, as market participants responded to heightened tensions between the nations, according to an ET report.India's External Affairs Ministry implemented various measures, including halting the Indus Waters Treaty and shutting down the Wagah-Attari border crossing. Additionally, the authorities cancelled visa privileges previously granted to Pakistani citizens under the SAARC agreement.The decline followed Wednesday's substantial losses at PSX, which occurred after the International Monetary Fund reduced Pakistan's GDP growth projection to 2.6%.The situation was further complicated by Fitch Ratings ' assessment, which expressed worries about the declining value of the rupee, political uncertainty, and security issues in Kashmir, factors that negatively influenced investor confidence.The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty will be suspended with immediate implementation.The Integrated Check Post Attari operations will cease immediately. Valid permit holders may exit through this route until May 1, 2025.Pakistani citizens' SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) privileges are revoked. Previously issued SVES visas to Pakistani nationals are now invalid. Current SVES visa holders from Pakistan must depart India within 48 hours.The Pakistani High Commission's Defence, Naval and Air Advisors in New Delhi have been designated Persona Non Grata and must leave India within seven days. India will recall its corresponding advisors from Islamabad. These diplomatic positions at both High Commissions will be eliminated. Additionally, five support personnel for Service Advisors will be withdrawn from each High Commission.The total diplomatic staff at both High Commissions will be reduced from 55 to 30 personnel, with this reduction to be completed by May 1, 2025.Indian stock markets showed minimal impact on Thursday, with investors maintaining vigilant observation of developments.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, stated, ""Nifty's decoupling from the S&P 500 is striking. While the S&P 500 is down 8.4% YTD, the Nifty is up 2.27%. The resilience of the Indian economy, the expected US slowdown, dollar weakness, and continued FII inflows—Rs 21,263 crore in the last six days—have driven this outperformance of India.""He further advised, ""However, going forward, the market will be concerned about the timing, nature and magnitude of India's response to the terror attacks and its consequences.

Apple's India Plans

Apple aims to significantly increase iPhone production in India as part of its strategy to diversify manufacturing away from China and protect against uncertainties stemming from US-China trade tensions under the Donald Trump administration.Currently, the company produces approximately 40-43 million iPhones annually in India, with about 80% for export markets, according to industry data. Production could increase to 70-80 million units by late 2026, positioning India as the primary iPhone supplier to the United States.The company produces iPhones in India through Foxconn and Tata Electronics , with Tata Electronics having acquired Wistron and Pegatron's facilities in the country.Industry experts indicate this transition could result in India manufacturing nearly 40% of global iPhone sales within the next 18 months, an increase from the present 18-20%.Government officials informed ET they will collaborate with Apple and its suppliers to facilitate this transition, which would substantially strengthen India's electronics manufacturing sector.Also Read | Apple’s China exodus: All US iPhones to be made in India by 2025 ""As per our estimates, Apple has reached a production scale of around 40-43 million iPhones in India for both domestic consumption and exports, amounting to 17-20% of its global shipments in 2024,"" said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president, IDC India.Singh noted that doubling iPhone production in India would require scaling up to 70-80 million units annually, significantly boosting India's expanding electronics manufacturing ecosystem.Apple, having established India as its second global iPhone manufacturing hub, is rapidly increasing its production capacity in this South Asian nation, which also represents the world's second-largest smartphone market.Apple's suppliers exported iPhones worth nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore in FY25, increasing from Rs 85,000 crore in FY24.Also Read | Goodbye China, Namaste India! Laptop brands shift production as PLI scheme bears fruit, Trump’s tariffs loom large The relocation of iPhone manufacturing will largely depend on India's standing in the evolving geopolitical landscape and the conditions of the proposed US trade agreement. Should the Trump administration adopt a lenient stance towards China, the transition to India could be slower.According to an industry insider, the relocation of global value chains (GVCs) will also depend on whether India implements substantial reforms to tackle ongoing cost inefficiencies and policy uncertainties related to taxes and tariffs, ensuring production doesn't divert from China to countries such as Vietnam.The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), whose members include Apple and other major electronics companies, indicates that India faces a cost disadvantage of 7% to 7.5% compared to Vietnam and China. Additional streamlining, particularly of crucial sub-assemblies and components, would enhance India's competitive position.A Niti Aayog study on electronics GVCs emphasises the necessity to reduce component tariffs to match China and Vietnam's levels, as current rates disadvantage Indian exports. The study additionally recommends harmonising direct and indirect tax structures to align with competing nations' offerings.Despite India's advantageous position compared to China and Vietnam under Trump's new tariff system, experts suggest that New Delhi must strategically negotiate to secure a beneficial long-term agreement with the US, whilst outmanoeuvring its manufacturing competitors.Also Read | China’s snub to India’s advantage?

NEW DELHI: The Government has released regulations for applications under the Rs 23,000-crore Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS), aimed at boosting domestic value addition in electronics production. Ashwini Vaishnaw Union Electronics and IT Minister revealed that firms with strong local design capabilities and 'six sigma' quality standards will be key evaluation factors. Companies lacking domestic design teams might be “left out” of the “phenomenal change” expected in India's electronics sector over the next five years, according to a report by The Economic Times.Applications for the six-year scheme will open on May 1 through an online portal.The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, had approved the ECMS earlier this month. The initiative seeks to attract substantial domestic and global investments, develop robust manufacturing capabilities, and integrate Indian companies into Global Value Chains (GVCs).S Krishnan, Secretary of the Electronics and IT Ministry, asserted that the scheme is timely, coinciding with geopolitical shifts that could redefine global value chains. It is expected to increase India's share in global electronics manufacturing from 3 per cent to 8 per cent over six years, according to him.The programme targets Rs 59,350 crore in investments, aims to create 91,600 direct jobs, and projects production worth Rs 4,56,500 crore.It offers a mix of turnover-linked and capital expenditure incentives, depending on component type, with employment generation tied to both incentive structures.ECMS covers sub-assemblies such as display and camera modules, core components like multilayer PCBs and lithium-ion cells, specific bare components including HDI and MSAP PCBs, as well as supply chain infrastructure and manufacturing equipment.Application windows differ: three months for sub-assemblies and bare components, and two years for supply chain and capital equipment categories.Atul Lall, vice chairman and managing director of Dixon Technologies, confirmed plans to invest significantly in at least four component categories under the scheme.Meanwhile, industry bodies highlighted the need for international collaborations and strong state partnerships to strengthen the electronics ecosystem.Additionally, Vaishnaw noted India's electronics production and export growth—both witnessing five- and sixfold increases respectively over the past decade—adding momentum to the ECMS.India’s electronics production has surpassed Rs 11 lakh crore (approximately $129 billion) annually. The country is targeting $300 billion by 2026 and $500 billion by 2030-31 in domestic electronics production Separately, the government announced Bengaluru-based Sarvam AI as the first startup selected to develop an indigenous foundational model under the IndiaAI Mission.Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), predicted that states would launch competitive initiatives to attract investments. He cited the mobile industry’s current $62 billion production base, suggesting ECMS will further strengthen India's components and sub-assembly ecosystems.Ashok Chandak, president of SEMI India and the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA), described the scheme as critical for boosting manufacturing capabilities while complementing the India Semiconductor Mission.The ECMS outlines various investment thresholds by component type, offering turnover-linked incentives for investments between Rs 50 crore and Rs 500 crore, alongside additional capex incentives for selected components.","The Government has released regulations for applications under the Rs 23,000-crore Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS) The scheme is aimed at boosting domestic value addition in electronics production.

NEW DELHI: India has successfully lifted 171 million people out of extreme poverty in the decade spanning from 2011-12 to 2022-23, according to the World Bank 's latest ""Poverty & Equity Brief.""The report reveals that extreme poverty, defined as living on less than USD 2.15 per day, fell from 16.2% in 2011-12 to 2.3% in 2022-23. This significant reduction marks the country’s success in pulling 171 million people above the extreme poverty line.""Over the past decade, India has significantly reduced poverty. Extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day) fell from 16.2 percent in 2011-12 to 2.3 percent in 2022-23, lifting 171 million people above this line. Rural extreme poverty dropped from 18.4 percent to 2.8 percent, and urban from 10.7 percent to 1.1 percent, narrowing the rural-urban gap from 7.7 to 1.7 percentage points—a 16 percent annual decline. "" the World Bank report stated.""India also transitioned into the lower-middle-income category. Using the $3.65 per day LMIC poverty line, poverty fell from 61.8 percent to 28.1 percent, lifting 378 million people out of poverty.Rural poverty dropped from 69 percent to 32.5 percent, and urban poverty from 43.5 percent to 17.2 percent, reducing the rural-urban gap from 25 to 15 percentage points with a 7 percent annual decline."" The report added.The World Bank also noted that rural extreme poverty decreased from 18.4% to 2.8%, and urban extreme poverty dropped from 10.7% to 1.1%. The gap between rural and urban poverty narrowed from 7.7 to 1.7 percentage points, reflecting an annual decline of 16%.In its assessment, the World Bank further observed that India transitioned into the lower-middle-income category. Using the USD 3.65 per day poverty line for lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), overall poverty fell from 61.8% to 28.1%, lifting 378 million people out of poverty. Rural poverty dropped from 69% to 32.5%, and urban poverty from 43.5% to 17.2%, reducing the rural-urban gap from 25 to 15 percentage points, with a 7% annual decline.The brief also highlighted that India's five most populous states—Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh—accounted for 65% of the country's extreme poor in 2011-12. These states were responsible for two-thirds of the reduction in extreme poverty by 2022-23. However, by 2022-23, these states still accounted for 54% of India’s extremely poor and 51% of its multidimensionally poor population.The World Bank’s multidimensional poverty index (MPI), which measures non-monetary poverty, showed a decline from 53.8% in 2005-06 to 16.4% by 2019-21.Regarding employment, the World Bank noted that employment growth had outpaced the working-age population since 2021-22, with employment rates, particularly among women, rising. Urban unemployment fell to 6.6% in Q1 FY24/25, the lowest since 2017-18. The data also indicated a shift of male workers from rural to urban areas for the first time since 2018-19, while rural female employment in agriculture has increased.Despite these improvements, challenges persist. The report highlighted that youth unemployment stands at 13.3%, with the rate rising to 29% among tertiary education graduates. Only 23% of non-farm paid jobs are formal, and much of agricultural employment remains informal. Furthermore, while self-employment is on the rise, especially among rural workers and women, gender disparities persist, with 234 million more men in paid work than women.The World Bank's Poverty and Equity Briefs provide valuable insights into poverty, shared prosperity, and inequality trends across over 100 developing countries.

Electronics component manufacturers will need to establish in-house design teams and achieve Six Sigma quality standards to benefit from the government’s Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS), Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Saturday.Speaking at the launch of the ECMS guidelines portal, Vaishnaw emphasized that while these requirements are not part of the formal approval criteria, they will play a key role in the evaluation of applications. “We have not included that as a formal criteria of approval, but I am saying in front of you that it will be like an informal criteria,” he said.The minister stressed the importance of design capabilities , noting that some companies have already set up design teams with up to 5,000 engineers. “If you don’t have a design team and even if you are fulfilling all your parameters, we will not approve you. Design teams have to be set up,” he added.Vaishnaw also urged manufacturers to maintain the highest quality standards, calling for adherence to Six Sigma — a methodology aimed at minimizing defects and ensuring near-perfect output, as reported news agency PTI. “Nothing less than Six Sigma will be tolerated. We will be evaluating your progress, not just on manufacturing volume, but also on the quality that you produce,” he said.He further noted that some companies have already begun producing dyes and tools required for manufacturing finished electronics components, a step he welcomed as part of India’s growing electronics ecosystem.","Electronics component manufacturers will need to establish in-house design teams and achieve Six Sigma quality standards to benefit from the government’s Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme.

"Roche could have earned over 100 times what it cost for rare disease drug, estimate activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/roche-could-have-earned-over-100-times-what-it-cost-for-rare-disease-drug-estimate-activists/articleshow/120624790.cms,"File photo: AP

Pharma major Roche may have earned over a hundred times what risdiplam , a drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), should cost to bring to market, according to calculations by public health activists.After Roche declined to share information on the cost of clinical trials, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), a US-based non-profit working on access to affordable medicines, calculated the costs and pegged them at about $50 million. Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.In response to the calculations sent to it by KEI, Roche stated: “Only a small fraction of projects make it ‘from bench to bedside’ and we have to absorb the cost of failing projects as well, while your calculation only addresses successful development. Similarly, our dedication to innovation extends to the continuous development of next-generation therapies—a commitment clearly reflected in our ongoing development work of new treatments in SMA. ”The three trials of risdiplam cited in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) involved 467 participants. The four trials with a start date before FDA approval involved 120 participants. KEI estimated per patient cost of conducting the trial by combining several data sources on the cost of conducting clinical trials.The United States provides a tax credit for qualifying clinical trials for rare diseases. After calculating the cost of the clinical trials, when KEI applied the orphan drug tax credit to the trial cost, the net cost ranged from $11 million to $25 million.Clinical trials typically constitute 60-70% of drug development costs.Roche was also awarded a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) in August 2020. The PRV is an incentive designed to encourage development of drugs and biologics for serious or life-threatening rare diseases. The PRV allows earlier market entry and extends the effective period of the monopoly by several months. The PRV can be sold to third parties. In 2020, the market value of a PRV was roughly $100 million, more than the Roche outlays on trials, pointed out KEI.Since 2003, when it was established, the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation (SMAF) has invested $100 million to develop drugs for this condition. Roche paid $30 million dollars to get an exclusive worldwide license to PTC Therapeutics' SMA programme, which it had developed in collaboration with SMAF.Roche’s costs of manufacturing the drug are not significant, with a year of treatment requiring less than 2 grams of risdiplam, which can probably be manufactured by Roche at less than $50,000 per kilo, or $50 per gram, estimated KEI. In India, the treatment with risdiplam typically costs Rs 72 lakh per adult patient per year, which is unaffordable for most.According to Roche’s response to TOI, as of October 2024, of the 168 patients receiving Roche’s treatment for SMA, 56 continued to be treated for free under the company’s Compassionate User Program (CUP), 53 were covered under various government policies -- Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Defence, Employee State Insurance (ESI) and Railways -- and the remaining 59 purchased the drug under Roche’s Patient Access Program, launched in 2021, “under which Roche provides free bottles of the treatment for every bottle that is purchased”.Cure SMA, a trust formed by parents of children with SMA, has 1,800 patients registered and the government portal for rare disease has 700 SMA patients registered.Lack of affordability has made patients approach courts to help bring down costs through local manufacture or through price negotiation by the government. Roche has opposed generic manufacture of the drug by an Indian company. A bottle of risdiplam costs Rs 2 lakh in India while it costs just Rs 44,700 in China and Rs 41,000 in Pakistan, according to an affidavit filed by an SMA patient in court. The Indian generic manufacturer, NATCO, has pegged the cost at Rs 15,900 per bottle with scope for further reduction if the government purchased it in bulk.“On average, it takes ten years to develop a new drug and only one out of ten drugs in early development will eventually make it to patients. And it is very complex to estimate the total cost of developing a new medicine, especially for extremely rare neurological diseases such as SMA. The cost of development goes well beyond preclinical research, clinical trials, and post-marketing studies, requiring many years of investment. There are also costs associated with ensuring safe and quality manufacturing setup and operations, and building a global and local infrastructure to ensure access around the world.,” stated Roche in its response to TOI.","Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.

California’s GDP hits $4.1 trillion in 2024; surpasses that of Japan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/californias-gdp-hits-4-1-trillion-in-2024-surpasses-that-of-japan-the-worlds-4th-largest-economy/articleshow/120612694.cms,"AI-generated image

California has overtaken Japan in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — a milestone highlighted by Governor Gavin Newsom , who warned that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could endanger the state’s growing prosperity.According to preliminary figures from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, California posted a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.1 trillion in 2024. This is higher than Japan’s $4.02 trillion GDP for the same period, as reported by the International Monetary Fund.This places California just behind the United States, China and Germany in total economic output, with the state’s economy growing by 6 per cent in 2024 — outpacing all three of those nations.“California isn’t just keeping pace with the world — we’re setting the pace,” Newsom said in a statement Wednesday according to CNN. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritise sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation.”However, Newsom cautioned that the state’s economic progress is under threat from what he called “the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.”“California’s economy powers the nation, and it must be protected,” he added.Also read: Donald Trump tariffs to hit global economy hard!

The suit argues that these measures are inflicting economic harm on California’s businesses and residents.The legal filing contests Trump’s authority to enact tariffs on key trading partners — Mexico, China and Canada — under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), citing a 10 per cent blanket tariff on all imports. Newsom's team argues the move is “unlawful and unprecedented” without congressional approval.Enacted in 1977, the IEEPA grants presidents broad powers to implement economic sanctions during national emergencies, but requires consultation with Congress.California recorded $675 billion in two-way trade in 2024, with Mexico, Canada and China serving as its primary trading partners. These three countries alone accounted for over 40 per cent of the state’s imports — $203 billion of the $491 billion total.Twelve other states joined California in filing lawsuits on Wednesday, accusing the Trump administration of implementing tariffs that amount to illegal tax hikes. The White House dismissed the coordinated legal challenge as a “witch hunt.”","California has overtaken Japan in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Governor Gavin Newsom warned that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could endanger the state’s growing prosperity.

In a policy shift aimed at accelerating US leadership in autonomous vehicle technology , the Trump administration is easing federal safety regulations to help domestic automakers like Elon Musk ’s Tesla stay ahead of Chinese rivals.The US department of transportation on Thursday unveiled a new framework that allows American companies to seek exemptions from certain safety rules when testing self-driving cars for non-commercial purposes—such as research and public demonstrations.""We’re in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,” said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement, justifying the move. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard ,"" he added.The move is intended to give US automakers greater flexibility as they push to develop fully autonomous vehicles.The administration is also revising crash reporting requirements for self-driving systems, a move directly addressing longstanding complaints from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has argued the rules are overly burdensome. Tesla, as the leading seller of partially automated vehicles in the US, has been disproportionately impacted by current reporting demands.While the obligation to report crashes will remain, the Transportation Department says it will be “loosened” to remove “unnecessary and duplicative” requirements—striking a balance between regulatory oversight and technological progress.The announcement comes just a day after Musk told investors that Tesla will begin rolling out self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas, this June. As China’s BYD and other rivals rapidly scale up their autonomous vehicle programs, the pressure is mounting on the US to respond.Previously, such exemptions were granted primarily to foreign vehicles entering the US market whose home-country regulations differed from those in the US.Also read: ‘India a very hot market but...’: Elon Musk-led Tesla says 100% car tariffs make customers anxious The incentive for Tesla comes just days after the automaker reported a stark drop of 71 per cent in profits in its Q1 earnings report.

Tesla showrooms throughout Europe and the United States have faced vandalism and boycott actions, triggered by Musk's endorsement of public sector reductions and his alignment with far-right personalities abroad. Protesters in Milan displayed an effigy of Musk, whilst demonstrators in Berlin and London branded Tesla vehicles as ""Swasticars.""Soon after the reports were released, Musk stated his intent on shifting focus back to Tesla.

Most Asian stocks climbed on Friday, driven by a strong rally on Wall Street, robust quarterly earnings from Alphabet, and renewed optimism around trade relations under US President Donald Trump.While most stocks showed positive trend, Indian stock indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , opened higher, but later plunged 700 points with the Sensex at 78,962.42 and Nifty50 also down at 23,926.95 during early trade. This came after seven days of gains, with the market pausing on Thursday, ending in the red due to cautious investor sentiment.

Market direction will likely depend on global trends and upcoming Q4 earnings.Meanwhile, Tokyo’s Nikkei rose 1 per cent, with gains also seen in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Nikkei’s rise came despite a major profit warning from Nissan, which projected losses of up to $5.3 billion for fiscal 2024–25.

Asian economies still face the risk of higher reciprocal tariffs,” he added.Adding to the optimism, Chan pointed to a growing possibility of earlier-than-expected interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has amassed $300.87 billion in US Treasury bills, accounting for nearly 5% of the entire short-term government debt market.As of March 2025, the total US Treasury bill market stood at $6.15 trillion, which means Berkshire controls approximately 4.89% of it—equivalent to nearly one in every twenty dollars in circulation, according to an ET report.The move highlights Buffett's focus on safety and liquidity amid high stock valuations and ongoing global economic uncertainty. The report also noted that Berkshire’s T-bill holdings now exceed those of the US Federal Reserve, which owns just over $195 billion in similar securities.More than 90% of Berkshire’s $334 billion cash reserves are invested in short-term government debt. This includes $14.4 billion classified as cash equivalents with maturities under three months, and $286.47 billion listed as short-term Treasury investments.With average T-bill yields at 4.359% in April 2025, Buffett appears to be prioritizing stable returns over riskier investments. The billionaire investor has not made a major acquisition in over two years, often citing high valuations as the reason. “Everything’s too expensive,” he has said in past interviews.Other major companies like Apple have also increased their exposure to Treasuries.

Tariff worries continue hanging over companies as they report their latest financial results and try to provide guidance on their path ahead.Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. The tariff and trade picture continues shifting and that makes it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales.Seemingly few industries or companies are being spared from the uncertainty. Food and beverage businesses, pharmaceutical companies, and makers of household staples are among the many companies trying to gauge the potential impact to costs and sales.A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that companies are right to be focused on tariffs. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are ""extremely"" or ""very"" concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or applianceHere's what companies are saying about tariffs and their potential impact:Procter & Gamble, the maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said Thursday said it's doing whatever it can to reduce higher costs from President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties.But P&G's Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten told reporters on a call that the consumer products giant still will likely have to pass on higher prices to shoppers as early as July.The consumer product giant reduced its annual financial outlook after reporting lower sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, during the latest quarter, due to a pullback in consumer spending over worries about tariffs as well as overall financial worries about job security and mortgage rates.""Everything plays into the consumer behavior,"" Schulten said. ""Uncertainty around the stock market and what their 401ks are worth and what the portfolio is worth. Uncertainty around the economic outlook and what it means for their livelihood and the job market.""PepsiCo lowered its full-year earnings expectations, citing increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.The maker of Pepsi beverages and Frito-Lay snacks said it now expects its core earnings per share to be even with last year. Previously it expected mid-single-digit percentage growth.A 25% tariff on imported aluminum is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. The company expects ""elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty"" for the rest of this year.Merck trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, though it maintained its guidance for revenue.The pharmaceutical giant has a global reach. Half of its revenue comes from the U.S. market, with the rest of the world making up the other half, according to FactSet. The company expects tariffs already implemented to cost the company about $200 million.American Airlines American Airlines withdrew its earnings forecast for the year amid uncertainty over the economy.While tariffs might not directly impact airlines and other companies in the travel sector, they could prompt a shift in consumer spending. Tariffs typically make goods more expensive and that might force consumers to tighten their budgets and focus more on necessities, while cutting back on discretionary items and services, such as travel.","Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed. The tariff and trade picture continues shifting and that makes it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales.

Wall Street rallies on strong corporate earnings despite lingering trade war jitters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-markets-dow-jones-industrial-index-nasdaq-sp-500-us-china-trade-deal-hopes-stay-murky/articleshow/120587807.cms,"US stocks rallied Thursday as a wave of better-than-expected corporate earnings lifted investor sentiment, though concerns about ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty continue to loom over Wall Street.According to the Associated Press, the S&P 500 climbed 1.9% in late trading, narrowing the gap to within 11% of its all-time high set earlier this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 450 points, or 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 2.5%, as strong performance from major tech and industrial companies buoyed markets.A standout contributor to the rally was ServiceNow, which saw its stock jump 15.8% after reporting first-quarter profits for 2025 that exceeded analyst expectations. The AI-powered enterprise software company also issued an upbeat forecast for subscription revenue, further boosting investor confidence.Southwest Airlines also delivered stronger-than-anticipated earnings, despite uncertainty clouding the broader economic outlook.

Many companies, spanning various industries, echoed similar concerns about issuing financial forecasts amid the volatile climate created by Trump’s trade policies.The trade war, sparked by the on-again-off-again imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump , has left businesses and investors grappling with shifting headlines and economic consequences. Optimism over a softening stance on tariffs had lifted markets earlier in the week, but that was shaken Thursday when China denied being in active negotiations with the US, likening reports of progress to “trying to catch the wind.”Tan Jing Yi of Mizuho Bank’s Asia & Oceania Treasury Department described Trump’s trade strategy as “headline turbulence,” warning of long-term harm to global economies and adding that sentiment continues to swing wildly “from hopes of intense relief to inflicted economic gloom.”The market’s week has been marked by extreme swings—beginning with sharp losses on trade fears and now rebounding on strong earnings—reflecting the lack of clarity around future economic policies. “It’s an unhealthy market backdrop right now, and we’re trying not to react too much,” said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.Despite the broader uncertainty, several companies delivered standout earnings results. Toymaker Hasbro saw its shares soar 15.6% after reporting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue, citing continued growth of its Magic: The Gathering card game. Semiconductor giant Texas Instruments also impressed, rallying 6.2% on better-than-forecast earnings.However, not all earnings news was positive. Consumer goods titan Procter & Gamble fell 3.6% even after beating profit expectations. The company’s revenue came in below forecasts, and it trimmed its full-year profit outlook, citing a $200 million earnings hit from higher commodity costs.PepsiCo similarly warned of challenges ahead. CEO Ramon Laguarta highlighted “more volatility and uncertainty,” with subdued consumer demand and higher costs due to tariffs—including a 25% import tariff on aluminum cans—contributing to a 5% drop in the company’s shares after it lowered its profit forecast for 2025.In the bond market, Treasury yields eased, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.30% from 4.40% the previous day. The decline followed a report showing that slightly more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week than anticipated. Additionally, March saw a sharper-than-expected drop in sales of previously owned homes, further signaling potential economic softening.Overseas, stock markets in Europe and Asia saw modest and mixed movements, reflecting the global ripple effects of trade policy uncertainties and economic concerns.While the earnings season has provided a temporary lift, market watchers agree that volatility is likely to persist until clearer signals emerge about the direction of US trade and fiscal policy.

Unsettled tariff policies and unpredictable trade war is weighing down companies as they try to provide investors with any financial outlooks in the latest financial results.While some tariffs on key US trading partners remain, others have been temporarily postponed to allow room for negotiations. However, the constantly shifting policies often changing by the day, have left businesses struggling to assess the impact on their costs and revenues.On Tuesday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent struck a cautiously optimistic note, saying he expected a “de-escalation” in the trade war with China . However, he also acknowledged that formal negotiations are yet to begin.Here’s how some of the biggest companies are handling the uncertainty:Chipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday said that the costs are increasing due to the tariffs. The chain sources beef from Australia, avocados from Colombia and Peru and packaging from Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. All the materials are now subjected to a 10% tariff.CFO Adam Rymer warned that tariffs could also drive up the cost of building new restaurants, as its Chinese-sourced equipment and materials would be affected, though the situation with China is still unpredictable.The food giant reported lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter and cut its full-year forecast for same-store sales.CEO Scott Boatwright blamed economic anxiety, saying it was the “overwhelming reason” for a decline in customer visits, an issue that has persisted into April.Tesla appears better positioned than many automakers, thanks to its largely domestic production. However, its energy division could take a hit due to reliance on LFP battery cells from China.The EV manufacturer could also face a major setback, as China being the world's largest electric market has also retaliated against the US.Earlier this month, Tesla suspended orders for its Model S and X in mainland China, another blow amid potential retaliation from Beijing, the world’s largest EV market.CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of President Trump, said he still supported “lower tariffs,” calling them a route to prosperity, but acknowledged that trade decisions ultimately lie with the president.Dutch multinational Akzo Nobel said its exposure to US tariffs is limited thanks to years of strategic localisation. CEO Gregoire Poux-Guillaume told analysts, “Over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the US.”“We also largely run China for China and use the rest of Asia instead as an export base.”The company deals in a range of products, from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the diy homeowners. However, major tariffs could still hurt businesses and sales.Medical device maker Boston Scientific expects most of the tariff pain to hit later this year, estimating a $200 million impact in 2025. Still, the company raised its earnings and revenue outlook, confident it can absorb the costs through stronger sales and belt-tightening.With a long-established global supply chain and significant US investment, Boston Scientific said that it was prepared to ride out the storm.Aircraft giant Boeing said most of its supply chain is US-based and that many imports from Canada and Mexico are protected under current trade agreements. Tariffs on other suppliers, including Japan and Italy, are expected to be recoverable, with a net cost of less than $500 million annually.Yet the aeroplane manufacturer is more concerned about retaliation from key markets, especially China, which has already halted deliveries of its aircraft.Telecoms giant AT&T said it is bracing for potential increases in the cost of mobile phones and network equipment. However, it believes that it can manage the fallout for now, based on the current pause in tariffs and supply chain.“The magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand,” said CEO John Stankey.",Chipotle Mexican Grill said that the costs are increasing due to the tariffs.

At present, they are subjected to a 10 per cent tariff under the existing trade policy introduced during the Trump administration.“India also has fewer non-tariff trade barriers, obviously, no currency manipulation, very, very little government subsidies, so that reaching a deal with the Indians is much easier,” Bessant said, quoted by the New York Post.The comments were made on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings in Washington DC, where trade tensions and global economic shifts have been key topics.President Trump has made it clear that he wants foreign governments to slash their tariff and non-tariff restrictions on American goods and help reduce the US trade deficit. India, the world’s most populous country, could be the first to secure a trade pact that meets those terms.The push for a deal comes as US Vice President JD Vance visited Jaipur on Tuesday, urging India to remove remaining non-tariff barriers, open its markets further, and step up imports of American energy and defence equipment. He called for stronger economic ties as part of a vision for a “prosperous and peaceful” 21st century between the two democracies.Trade figures reflect the growing importance of the relationship. The New York Post cited US census bureau data showing that India made up nearly 3 per cent of US imports as of February. In 2024, the US trade deficit with India stood at $45.7 billion, according to the office of the US trade representative.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent says talks with India are close to a breakthrough.

Tesla's profits plunged by 71% in Q1 2025. Can Elon Musk turn it around?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/teslas-profits-plunged-by-71-in-q1-2025-can-elon-musk-turn-it-around/articleshow/120581496.cms,"Elon Musk is facing one of his toughest tests yet: restoring confidence in Tesla’s brand. The electric carmaker has seen its profits plunge by 71 percent in the first quarter of 2025, driven largely by a backlash against Musk’s political affiliations and controversial role in President Donald Trump’s administration.Sales of Tesla vehicles across Europe have dropped sharply, with a 45 percent decline in the EU and a staggering 62 percent fall in Germany alone, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). Showrooms in Europe and the US have become targets for vandalism and boycott campaigns following Musk’s support for public sector cuts and far-right figures overseas. In Milan, protesters hung Musk in effigy, while in Berlin and London, demonstrators labelled Tesla vehicles as “Swasticars. ”Also read: 'Will spend less time at DOGE from May': Elon Musk to focus on Tesla as its profits plunge 71%

Despite these setbacks, Musk appears intent on shifting focus back to Tesla. During Tuesday’s earnings call, he announced plans to reduce his time working for the “Department of Government Efficiency” – a post he holds in Trump’s administration – to just one or two days per week starting in May. Tesla’s shares rose nearly five percent following the announcement.Musk rejected claims that political controversies were damaging the brand, instead blaming recent sales drops on production halts caused by upgrades to the Model Y.Analysts, however, are not convinced. JP Morgan described the situation as one of “unprecedented brand damage,” while Wedbush’s Dan Ives, a longstanding supporter of Tesla, called it a “full-blown crisis.”Also read: Tesla feels the heat: Elon Musk’s DOGE politics hits Tesla profits

Compounding Tesla’s woes is the rise of aggressive competition, particularly from Chinese automaker BYD, which is developing ultra-fast charging batteries. European manufacturers are also rolling out new models with advanced technology, further eating into Tesla’s market share. In the US, Tesla’s dominance has slipped, with its EV market share falling below 50 percent.Meanwhile, Tesla continues to pin its hopes on autonomous driving. Musk reaffirmed that its Robotaxi service would launch in Austin by June, despite Google’s Waymo already offering millions of driverless trips in several American cities. Musk insists that software updates will soon allow current Teslas to operate autonomously, although such promises have been made – and missed – before.Tesla’s valuation remains lofty, trading at over 100 times its projected earnings, making the company highly vulnerable to further setbacks.","Sales of Tesla vehicles across Europe have dropped sharply, with a 45 percent decline in the EU and a staggering 62 percent fall in Germany.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105804461,imgsize-22527,width-400,resizemode-4/105804461.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

Overall, the trend of HAL is looking sideways. It has strong support at the Rs 4,350 levels and resistance at the Rs 5,000 levels. Very range-bound momentum is expected in the coming time, however, as the trend of HAL is sideways to up, we are recommending a 'buy' on support levels in HAL.

The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident. IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief.""HAL subsequently released a statement conveying their sympathies, stating they were ""deeply saddened by the loss of the courageous IAF pilot.""

"What do new labour codes mean for employees & employers? From minimum wages, gratuity benefits to appointment letters & layoff rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-do-new-labour-codes-mean-for-employees-employers-from-minimum-wages-gratuity-benefits-to-appointment-letters-layoff-rules-top-things-to-know/articleshow/125545231.cms,"The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensure worker safety, extend social security benefits to gig workers. (AI image)



Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

These new labour codes will replace 29 existing labour laws. These codes are:

The Code on Wages, 2019

The Code on Social Security, 2020

The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020

The Industrial Relations Code, 2020

Result of Rationalizing Labour Laws

What should employees know about the new labour codes?

There will now be separate classifications for 'employee' and 'worker', with different benefits allocated to each category.

A 'worker' means someone who belongs to the 'workman' category from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, including individuals who perform manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical, or supervisory duties.

It excludes those in 'supervisory', 'managerial', or 'administrative' positions. Whilst the earlier legislation primarily addressed industrial disputes and retrenchment, the current definition has expanded considerably.

Workers will receive specific entitlements, including overtime compensation and leave encashment, as per the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020. Regulations regarding working hours, annual leave, and standing orders apply specifically to 'workers'.

The codes bring in a unified 'wages' definition across all four sections. Earlier, multiple interpretations of 'wages' and 'salary' created difficulties in benefit calculations, which then resulted in inconsistencies and even legal disputes.

This 'wages' definition now applies to calculations for Gratuity, Employees' State Insurance, Leave Encashment, Overtime, Statutory Bonus, and other benefits. This standardisation aims to improve compliance through greater clarity.

Fixed term employees will get all benefits equal to permanent workers. This includes leave, medical, and social security. They will be eligible for gratuity after just one year, instead of the current five. Additionally, they will get equal wages as permanent staff, increasing income and protection.

To put it simply, gig workers and the unorganized sector will finally see social security benefits.

The new labour laws allow for companies that employ fewer than 300 workers to do layoffs and retrenchments without seeking prior governmental approval.

What are the key provisions of the new labour codes?

What do the new labour codes mean for employers?

Evaluate employment roles: Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work.

Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work. Assess the impact of the definition of ‘wages’ on employees’ salary structure: Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’

Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’ Analyze cost implications: Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization.

Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization. Reassess hiring models: Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment.

Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment. Align HR and Payroll policies: Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations.

Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations. Establish a robust compliance framework: Implement strong internal controls, conduct periodic diagnostic reviews, and ensure effective governance

New labour codes 2025: The government has introduced what experts are calling a significant reform in labour laws by implementing four comprehensive labour codes from November 21, 2025. The new labour codes impact both employers and employees. The new laws mean some big benefits for workers - universal minimum wages, gratuity benefits, social security coverage, provisions for women to do night shifts, recognition of gig economy workers, formal appointment letter requirement etc. However, some provisions also raise employment security issues.The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensuring worker safety, extending social security benefits to gig workers, and guaranteeing timely wage payments, while establishing minimum wage standards.At the same time, the new codes provide businesses increased operational flexibility whilst maintaining regulatory certainty, particularly important given current global economic challenges. Outdated labour laws have in the past deterred foreign investment in India's manufacturing sector, with companies often favouring countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh for their production facilities.Government officials indicated that rules for the four codes - covering wages, industrial relations, social security, and occupational safety and health - would be implemented within 45 days.Following their notification by 2020, the actual implementation had remained pending. The government has now officially announced the implementation. Whilst the final implementation rules from central and state governments are awaited, they are anticipated to be released soon.As Arvind Panagariya, Chairman of 16th Finance Commission wrote in TOI, “The importance of the four codes lies in breaking the ice. For the first time since the launch of reforms, they have removed the first set of hurdles in the way of creating high productivity jobs in large numbers.”These consolidated labour codes aim to streamline the existing laws, enhance digital compliance, improve workforce management systems, and strengthen worker protection along with facilitating business operations.EY is of the view that the implementation of the labour codes is a significant and long-awaited initiative by the government. “These codes are poised to impact nearly every function within organizations, given the extensive changes they introduce,” it says.“However, it may also result in increased costs for organizations due to wider scope of the definition of wages. There are still ambiguities regarding coverage of different components of salary within the definition of wages (such as coverage of performance bonuses / one-off payments, etc.),” notes EY in a note on the new Labour codes.The new labour laws restrict contract labour usage in organisations' 'core activities', barring specific exceptions. Core activity includes the main purpose of establishment creation and includes essential operations necessary for such activities.Additionally, fixed-term employment has received formal recognition as a legitimate employment arrangement, but it is contingent upon some conditions and regulatory requirements.The regulations also authorise states to implement adaptable work arrangements. Certain states, including Haryana and Odisha, have incorporated flexible working provisions in their draft regulations, permitting organisations to implement four-day work schedules, notes EY.EY notes that the labour codes significantly affect various aspects of HR and payroll policies. “Certain provisions overlap with existing state-specific Shops and Establishments laws, which are not superseded by the labour codes, potentially leading to conflicts, especially concerning working hours, leave, and related issues,” it says.Organizations operating in multiple states may have to ensure compliance with both sets of laws in each jurisdiction. Additionally, since specific provisions apply only to 'workers,' organizations may need to implement different policies for various employee categories, it adds.The new labour legislation also authorises both the central and state governments to create and execute welfare programmes for platform workers, gig economy participants, and unorganised sector employees.This can include life insurance, disability protection, healthcare provisions, maternity support, retirement security and any associated benefits.For gig worker social security arrangements, platform aggregators are required to contribute between 1-2% of their yearly turnover to the social security fund. This is subject to 5% of the amount paid or payable by an aggregator to gig workers, to the social security fund.This is a change from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which had set this limit at 100 workers. According to EY, the move offers businesses greater workforce management flexibility to adapt to market conditions.Additionally, the regulations also introduce a 're-skilling' fund to support any laid off workers in acquiring new skills. “For every retrenched worker, the employer is required to contribute 15 days’ last drawn wages (or any other amount notified by the central government) to a fund to be called the worker re-skilling fund,” explains EY.According to EY, It is essential for organizations to thoroughly assess the implications of these changes and prepare for a smooth transition to ensure compliance and operational efficiency. It suggests the following for organizations:The effectiveness of the new labour laws will substantially be dependent on state-level implementation, workforce education, and robust compliance monitoring.","The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensure worker safety, extend social security benefits to gig workers. The codes bring in a unified 'wages' definition across all four sections. Fixed term employees will get all benefits equal to permanent workers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125546141,imgsize-32136,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-codes.jpg"

Piyush Goyal Calls India A Stability Anchor Amid Global Flux And Says The Coming 2 Years Are Pivotal

India’s economy is expected to remain firmly on a strong growth path over the next two years, with S&P Global Ratings projecting 6.5 per cent expansion in the current fiscal and 6.7 per cent in the next.The agency said a combination of tax cuts and monetary policy easing will bolster consumption-led growth despite the drag from higher US tariffs.As cited by news agency PTI, S&P noted that India’s real GDP grew 7.8 per cent in April–June, the fastest pace in five quarters.Official GDP numbers for July–September will be released on November 28. “We anticipate that India’s GDP will grow by 6.5 per cent in fiscal year 2026… and 6.7 per cent in fiscal 2027, with risks evenly balanced,” S&P said in its Economic Outlook Asia-Pacific report, adding that strong domestic consumption continues to support momentum.The RBI has forecast 6.8 per cent GDP growth for the current fiscal, compared to 6.5 per cent last year, PTI reported.According to S&P, securing a trade agreement with the US would help reduce uncertainty and lift confidence, particularly for labour-intensive sectors.It added that lowered GST rates , combined with income-tax cuts and interest rate reductions this year, will push consumption to play a larger role in growth than investment in FY26 and FY27.The government’s Budget for FY26 raised the income-tax rebate limit to Rs 12 lakh from Rs 7 lakh, providing Rs 1 lakh crore in relief to the middle class.In June, the RBI cut policy rates by 50 basis points to a three-year low of 5.5 per cent.Additionally, GST rates on about 375 items were slashed from September 22, making mass-consumption goods cheaper, PTI noted.S&P said elevated US tariffs continue to weigh on India’s export-oriented manufacturing, though there are early signs Washington may lower duties on some Indian products.The agency added that the US’s revised trade policy approach is forcing governments and firms to focus on securing exemptions, diverting resources from productivity-enhancing efforts.",S&P Global Ratings projects 6.5 per cent expansion in the current fiscal and 6.7 per cent in the next.

Gold price prediction today: Where are gold prices headed in the coming days? Investors should watch out for these levels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-november-25-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/125554809.cms,"In the very short-term, spot gold will move as per the shifts in the December Fed rate cut probability. (AI image)



Gold price prediction :

Gold prices are likely to be influenced by the buzz around the prospect of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates in the coming reviews, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan. The analyst shares his views on gold and silver price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

On November 24, spot gold erased its losses in the Asian session to trade higher in the US session as it tracked the December Fed rate cut probability higher.

At the time of writing this article, it was changing hands at $4095, up nearly 0.70% for the day. The MCX December gold contract at Rs 123,913 was down 0.22% due to appreciation in the Indian Rupee that was triggered by RBI’s intervention and Fed rate cut hopes.

In the week ending November 21, the yellow metal, weighed down by encouraging September US nonfarm payroll report, closed 0.46% lower for the week at $4065, though it cut its losses on renewed hopes of a December rate cut sparked by New York President John Williams saying that he sees a room to cut rate in December as downside risk to the US job market has increased while upside risk to inflation has subsided.

Data roundup:

US data released on November 21 showed that composite PMI rose from 54.60 to 54.8 on better-than-expected services PMI. University of Michigan sentiment (Nov.) at 51 remains mired at record low though. One-year and five-ten-year inflation expectations eased.

UK composite PMI fell from 52.2 in October to 50.50 in November.

Eurozone composite PMI at 52.4 in November preliminary reading trailed the estimate of 52.50 on disappointing data out of Germany.

Japan's composite PMI at 52 topped the forecast of 51.50.

Earlier, the US nonfarm payroll report released on November 20 turned out to be a somewhat decent report. US added 119K jobs in September Vs the forecast 53K, though two-month net job revision stood at -33K. Private payrolls increased by 97K jobs; thus, beat the forecast of 65K jobs. However, unemployment rate ticked higher from 4.32% to 4.44%, as labour force participation rate edged higher from 62.3% to 62.4% Vs the estimate of 62.30%. Average hourly earnings were up 3.8% y-o-y Vs the forecast of 3.7%.

Fedspeak:

December Fed rate cut probability:

US Dollar and yields:

The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing this report, was steady around 100.15.

Two-year yields, which slumped 1.71% last week, edged higher by 2 bps to 3.53%, while ten-year yields, which eased 2.5% last week, were 1 bps down to 4.05%.

ETF and COMEX inventory:

As of November 21, total known global ETF holdings stood at 97.30 MOz, down nearly 0.09 MOz on the week, but continuing to hover around a 3-year high level. ETF holdings are up 17.44% YTD, though down 1.65% from the cycle high of 98.23 MOz as seen on October 21.

Eligible COMEX inventory was noted at 17.45 Moz as on November 21, down 2.22% from the cycle high of 22.45 MOz as on April 14.Fed rate cut probability:

Fed blackout period:

Geopolitics watch:

Upcoming data/events:

Major US data to be released this week include retail sales advance (September), PPI (Sept.), Conference Board Consumer confidence (November), Pending home sales (Oct.), 3Q GDP, real personal spending (October) and PCE Price Index (October) and beige book.

October and November nonfarm payroll reports will be released together on December 19; however, October unemployment rate will not be released due as household survey was not done in October.

October CPI report may not be released.

Gold Price Outlook :

In the very short-term, spot gold will move as per the shifts in the December Fed rate cut probability emerging as the major driving factor.

The metal is supported by geopolitical issues, too.

Fed Waller's comments have reduced the downside pressure.

USD-INR currency pair may swing wildly as per the risk appetite in the financial markets, which will affect domestic commodities prices.

Healthy risk appetite can limit the upside.

Overall, gold is expected to range trade between $3980 and $4160/$4200, while the interim resistance is at $4125. Strong US data may see the metal correcting lower.

Silver: seen range trading

At the time of writing this article, spot silver was hovering around $50.50, up around 1% for the day, as the metal rose on rate cut hopes. The MCX December silver contract at Rs 154,341 was up by 0.12% as stronger INR trimmed the gains.

In the week ending November 21, spot silver closed with a loss of nearly 1% at $50.02, though the grey metal cut its losses on Friday on fresh rate cut hopes.

Money managers decreased their bullish silver bets by 7,357 net-long positions to 29,893, least bullish position since August 19. Short-only positions increased by 550 lots to 12826. Long only position was at the lowest since April 22.

Silver lease rate stands at 4.19%, somewhat still elevated.

Total known global silver ETF holdings stood at 819.87 MOz, nearly the highest level since July 2202. Holdings are up around 14.52% YTD.

Silver is expected to range trade and move mostly in reaction to December Fed rate cut probability swings.

Support is at $49.30/$48.60, while resistance comes in at $51.07/$52.37.

Strong US data/impaired risk appetite can lead to a correction.

Emkay Global has downgraded ACC to sell due to weak margin trends and slower capex execution with the target price cut sharply to Rs 1,600 from Rs 2,280. Analysts said that ACC’s valuation revised to 7x EV/EBITDA (economic value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation from 9x given deteriorating fundamentals.

MUMBAI: Credit card usage rose in October 2025, when festival demand lifted the number of transactions even as the average ticket size fell dragging down value of transactions. Volumes increased 4.6% from Sept to 51.8 crore, but the total value of card spending declined 1.1% to around Rs. 2.1 lakh crore because shoppers made more but smaller purchases.PoS (card machine) use led the rise in October. PoS volume increased to 26.1 crore, and PoS value climbed to Rs 8.8 lakh crore. The shift reflects a return to in-store buying during the festival period, when households tend to buy clothing, electronics, and appliances at physical shops. Higher-value purchases at stores helped lift PoS spending after a weak Sept.Online spending eased with e-commerce volume rising to 25.5 crore transactions in Oct, but the value fell to Rs 12.6 lakh crore from Rs 14.4 lakh crore. The pattern shows that online spending remains tied to specific discount events. Without such offers in Oct, e-commerce value retreated even as volumes rose. The divergence between PoS and e-commerce shows how seasonal shopping patterns influence credit card use.Sept had shown the opposite trend. Card value rose 13.4% from Aug to Rs 2.2 lakh crore, driven by digital channels. E-commerce value jumped to Rs. 14.4 lakh crore in Sept, reflecting high-value purchases during online sales. PoS activity, meanwhile, dipped in volume and stayed flat in value.UPI continued to grow at a steady pace.","PoS (card machine) use led the rise in October.

Trump family optimistic about crypto

Here is how Trump family’s crypto-related holdings are faring:

Trump Media sees $800 Million Valuation Loss

Trump Media Shares Have Tumbled 66% in Past Year

World Liberty Financial: $3 Billion Paper Loss

Bitcoin buying company shares struggle after 2025 peak

American Bitcoin: A decline of $330 Million

Trump Memecoin: $120 Million Loss

The recent crash in the cryptocurrency market has cost US President Donald Trump and his family several millions of dollars. During Donald Trump's second presidential term, digital assets have significantly altered his family's wealth and portfolio. But the perils and instability associated with cryptocurrency investments is now being felt by Trump and his followers.According to a Bloomberg report, the Trump-associated memecoin has seen a huge 25% decline since August. The Bitcoin mining investment held by Eric Trump has dropped by approximately 50% from its highest point. Additionally, Trump's social media enterprise, which began accumulating Bitcoin this year, is trading at near-record lows!This decline is part of a larger cryptocurrency market downturn that has eliminated more than $1 trillion in value across digital assets. The Trump family's net worth has decreased from $7.7 billion to $6.7 billion since early September, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index - this drop has mainly been due to their expanding cryptocurrency investments.Eric Trump maintains his optimistic stance on cryptocurrency. He continues to advocate for investment, particularly during market downturns.Eric Trump told Bloomberg, “What a great buying opportunity.People who buy dips and embrace volatility will be the ultimate winners. I have never been more bullish on the future of cryptocurrency and the modernization of the financial system.""Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience through numerous significant declines, consistently reaching new heights afterwards. The Trump family's cryptocurrency investments are structured advantageously. Despite owning declining crypto assets and shares, they secure income through various industry engagements.Consider their co-founded venture, World Liberty Financial: While their token holdings have decreased in value, they retain rights to revenue from token sales, independent of market prices.Georgetown University finance professor Jim Angel observes: ""Retail investors can only speculate. The Trumps can not only speculate, but they can create tokens, sell them and make money off those transactions.""Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which owns Truth Social, saw its shares plummet to their lowest point on Wednesday. The decline appears partially linked to their recent cryptocurrency investments, the Bloomberg report said.The value of Trump’s stake has decreased approximately $800 million since September. His holdings, managed through a trust under Donald Trump Jr.'s supervision, form the largest share in the company.The unprofitable company has ventured into various sectors, notably cryptocurrency. Their investment includes approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and associated securities, as stated in July.Their Bitcoin portfolio of about 11,500 coins, acquired at roughly $115,000 per coin, currently shows a 25% deficit. Additionally, they invested in CRO tokens from a Singapore-based exchange. Their CRO holdings, valued at $147 million in September, have since depreciated by approximately 50%.The company is also developing Truth Predict, a platform for sports and political wagering, through collaborative efforts with other enterprises.The WLFI token, World Liberty Financial's primary cryptocurrency offering backed by the Trump family, has seen a significant decrease, falling from 26 cents in early September to approximately 15 cents.The Trump family's WLFI token holdings, previously valued at nearly $6 billion, have decreased to about $3.15 billion.Alt5's investors experienced considerable losses, with share values declining by approximately 75% post-announcement.The Trump family's Alt5 investment through World Liberty decreased by roughly $220 million. However, they maintained profitability, receiving about 75% of World Liberty token sales proceeds, totalling $500 million from the Alt5 transaction, according to Bloomberg calculations. Additionally, they earned approximately $400 million from previous WLFI token sales.""Crypto is here to stay,"" a spokesperson for World Liberty Financial said in a statement. ""World Liberty Financial has long-term conviction in the rapidly maturing technologies underpinning digital assets, which we believe will radically improve financial services.""Approximately two months following Trump's presidential induction, his family engaged in a fresh cryptocurrency initiative. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. entered into a partnership with cryptocurrency enterprise Hut 8 Corp., establishing intricate business arrangements. Hut 8 contributed its Bitcoin mining infrastructure for a controlling interest in a newly established venture, American Bitcoin Corp.Eric Trump maintains approximately 7.5% ownership in American Bitcoin, currently listed on Nasdaq as ABTC. Donald Trump Jr. holds a lesser, unspecified portion of shares.ABTC shares reached their highest value at $9.31 in early September, valuing Eric Trump's holdings at roughly $630 million. Subsequently, the share price decreased by over 50%, resulting in a reduction of more than $300 million in family assets. This venture represents one of the most notable instances where the Trumps generated significant cryptocurrency wealth through recent business activities.Investors who acquired ABTC shares at the initial public offering experienced a 45% depreciation in value.The Trump-associated cryptocurrency has seen significant decline following its weekend launch during the presidential inauguration. Its value has diminished by approximately 25% since late August.The precise family holdings remain unclear. Analysis by Gauntlet, specialising in risk assessment, identified digital wallets linked to the cryptocurrency's creation containing nearly 17 million tokens shortly after launch. These wallets transferred an additional 17 million tokens to cryptocurrency exchanges. A subsequent 90 million tokens became available in July. Bloomberg Billionaires Index attributes 40% of the total to the Trump family, based on their World Liberty Financial ownership.At current market rates, these holdings are valued at approximately $310 million, representing a $117 million reduction since late August.The Trump family's token position has expanded substantially, according to index calculations. Certain tokens, initially restricted from trading and held by founders and insiders, are becoming available through a three-year release schedule.Following July's release event, approximately 90 million additional Trump tokens became available to insiders, with Bloomberg's wealth index attributing roughly 40% to the Trump family.These newly accessible tokens are valued at approximately $220 million, resulting in an overall increase in the family's holdings. Information regarding any token sales by the Trump family since July remains unavailable.","The Trump-associated memecoin has seen a huge 25% decline since August.

Gold outlook: Yellow metal retains shine as global uncertainty fuels record demand; HSBC sees continued strength ahead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gold-outlook-yellow-metal-retains-shine-as-global-uncertainty-fuels-record-demand-hsbc-sees-continued-strength-ahead/articleshow/125537648.cms,"Representative image

Gold is set to remain firmly supported in the months ahead, with HSBC describing the metal as a reliable shield against global volatility.In its Think Future 2026 outlook, the bank said gold continues to benefit from powerful demand both from central banks and retail investors amid persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty.As per news agency ANI, HSBC noted that gold is on track for its strongest yearly performance in almost 50 years, rallying about 54 per cent so far in 2025.The bank described this as “one of its most successful years,” driven by heightened anxiety over global stability and concerns surrounding potential US dollar debasement.Prices climbed to a historic peak of $4,380 per ounce in October before easing as retail investors booked profits. Even after retreating to around $3,885, the metal has stabilised near the $4,000 mark. HSBC said gold “appears to have resumed its upward trend,” according to ANI.A major driver of resilience has been unwavering central-bank demand. The share of gold in global central bank reserves rose from 13 per cent in 2022 to roughly 22 per cent by the second quarter of 2025.Despite prices more than doubling, HSBC said elevated levels have not discouraged institutional buyers, who are seeking protection from “geopolitical conflicts, economic and fiscal challenges, rising inflation, and significant political shifts.”Their ongoing accumulation is expected to create a strong price floor.Retail participation has also strengthened, particularly through gold ETFs, which have seen consistent inflows since mid-2024. HSBC attributed this demand to the same factors driving central-bank buying — uncertainty, inflation risks and weakening confidence in the dollar — as per ANI.While gold has recently moved in step with equity markets, HSBC stressed this is a behavioural anomaly at high price levels rather than any dilution of its safe-haven role. The metal “is still a protective asset,” the report said.Expectations of more US Federal Reserve rate cuts, following delays in economic data caused by the shutdown, add further support.HSBC said this could lift prices further, although gains may be slower than before.The bank flagged two risks: a sudden hawkish shift by the Fed and a quicker-than-anticipated rebound in global economic conditions. Still, with uncertainty lingering and the dollar outlook fragile, gold’s bias remains upward, reported ANI.","HSBC said gold continues to benefit from powerful demand both from central banks and retail investors.

Taiwan War Could Crash Global Economy As U.S. Warns Of 10% GDP Wipeout & Nuclear Risk

Bessent says inflation ‘has nothing to do with tariffs’ as U.S. rolls them back: Full interview

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has insisted the United States is not heading for a recession in 2026, expressing strong confidence that President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy and new trade agreements will bring economic relief over the next year.Speaking to NBC News’ Meet the Press, Bessent said he was “very, very optimistic on 2026” and argued that the administration had “set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy”.Bessent said the White House expects healthcare costs to fall and promised fresh announcements on that front this week.At the same time, he acknowledged that some parts of the economy are struggling, echoing earlier comments from National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett that interest-rate-sensitive sectors, especially housing, have been in recession.Bessent also pointed out that the 43-day government shutdown — the longest on record — had squeezed economic activity.A recent NBC News poll showed that nearly two-thirds of registered voters believe the administration has not delivered on the economy or cost of living.Despite this, Bessent highlighted Trump’s sweeping domestic policy package — the so-called “One Big, Beautiful Bill” — saying its various tax breaks and income-boosting measures are still kicking in and will support households next year.As per CNBC, the law introduces benefits including a larger state-and-local tax deduction, tax relief on overtime and tip income, and a senior “bonus” to offset Social Security taxes.Bessent blamed the services sector, rather than Trump’s tariffs, for ongoing inflation. He said lower energy prices should help cool inflation further, which currently sits around 3% annually.Inflation is running 0.5% higher in Democratic-led states, a gap Bessent attributed to “increased regulation”, reported Reuters.Hassett, speaking separately to Fox News, predicted that 2026 would be “an absolute blockbuster year,” although he warned of a “hiccup” in fourth-quarter data because of the shutdown.He said growth could slow to between 1.5% and 2% before picking up strongly next year.Bessent also defended the administration’s approach to the Russia-Ukraine peace push, telling NBC News that Trump is “a president of peace” and arguing that Europe's repeated sanctions packages had failed.He supported the 28-point peace proposal backed by the US, despite concerns raised by Ukraine, European governments and American lawmakers.Bessent further used the interview to urge Senate Republicans to end the filibuster if Democrats trigger another government shutdown, calling the recent closure a “1.5% hit to GDP”.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has insisted the United States is not heading for a recession in 2026.

Inside FurtherAI’s Bid to Rethink Insurance Workflows

You

in

that

resented

On a recent afternoon in San Francisco, Aman's grandmother called from Bhopal to tell him she had started using AI.She is 85, the kind of north Indian grandmother who still rises at four every morning for puja. So Aman Gour, co-founder and CEO of FurtherAI, did what any AI founder would do when his octogenarian nani announces a tech pivot.“What AI are you using?” he asked. “ChatGPT?”“No, beta,” she said. “Whenever I have questions, I call you.are my AI. Aman's Intelligence.”It’s a joke with a sharp little truth inside it. Long before large language models began absorbing the world’s PDFs, there were grandchildren on patchy phone lines answering questions about the internet and more importantly, WhatsApp settings. Intelligence, artificial or otherwise, has always been relational.FurtherAI, the company Aman now runs out of a new office that “looks like a regal insurance building,” is very muchthe business of building that relationship between machine and human into something practical: a kind of AI workspace for the people who keep the modern economy insured.If you’ve never thought about how insurance actually gets done, the industry is one of those invisible infrastructures (like sewers or DNS) that only makes headlines when something goes wrong.But for underwriters, brokers, and claims adjusters, the day-to-day reality is screens full of PDFs, spreadsheets, and emails.“We met these folks who are basically managing trillions in risk,” Aman told me. “And they’re spending their days copying numbers from one place to another.”To understand why somebody would devote their life to automating the unglamorous middle of commercial insurance, it helps to picture a boy in a kirana shop in Bhopal, sitting between two men who disagreed about time.One was his father, a shopkeeper who would later build a small empire of gas stations. For him, time was scarce. “You have 24 hours,” he told his son. “Get the best out of it.” Sundays were for work; that’s simply what adults did.The other was his grandfather, a teacher. Life is long, he would say. There is time.As a child, Aman sat on a low stool between the counter and sacks of grain, literally looking left and right at these two philosophies. On the wall, decades later, his grandfather would tape up a Times of India clipping of Ajay Banga and ask, “Aman, when are you going to come here?”Aman didn’t know, but the question lodged somewhere. It became, over time, the sentence he now carries around in his head: “Live micro, plan macro.” Work hard on the day in front of you; keep a larger pattern loosely in mind.The “micro” started with the well-worn Indian script: Bhopal to Kota for IIT coaching (“the infamous Bansal classes”), waking at 3:30 AM to stay ahead of an ocean of teenage ambition; from Kota to IIT Bombay for computer science; from there to a coveted job at Microsoft. He describes himself as more hard-working than brilliant, forever a little uneasy among the effortless prodigies who could do absurd mental math after three beers, but he kept finding ways to climb.Then, as tends to happen in stories like this, boredom and curiosity conspired. At Microsoft, he entered an internal hackathon, built something that did well, and realized he wanted to build entire products. He quit to start his first company, TurboHire, which used AI to automate recruitment workflows and eventually scaled to more than a million dollars in ARR.It was an innovative SaaS business that grew to over a million dollars in revenue and taught Aman how to build companies from scratch — and eventually, he exited and moved to the Bay Area to start the next chapter.When Aman and his eventual co-founder, Sashank Gondala, applied to Y Combinator, they did it with a different idea, though: AI for software testing. The idea made perfect sense to them; it, in fact, got them into the program. But sitting in the compressed, slightly feverish atmosphere of YC, listening to partners who had seen hundreds of start-ups either catch fire or quietly fade out, they were forced into a distinction.“Tom Blomfield told us there are zero-million-dollar companies and zero-billion-dollar companies,” Aman recalled, referring to the Monzo founder who is now a YC group partner. “In the beginning they both have zero in revenue. But one is built to go public, and one isn’t.”Their testing idea, they realized, was a zero-million. A nice business. Just notbusiness.There are easy ways to respond to feedback like that. You can decide the partner is wrong, double down on your vision, and keep going. More dangerously, you can pinball from idea to idea in what founders call “pivot hell,” never staying long enough with any of them to know if they actually work.The harder thing is to hold the steering wheel steady while you change the road beneath you.Blomfield’s advice was oddly specific: go look at vertical AI. Pick one industry with dense unstructured data, shrinking margins, and lousy tools. Commit to it for three months. Then decide.“We resisted at first,” Aman said. “We didn’t know anything. We didn’t know what lawyers do, what insurers do, what people in logistics actually do all day.”But he and Sashank also knew their own pattern. For nearly a decade, both had been working on workflow automation, getting machines to handle the boring parts of knowledge work.The insurance industry is built on documents: broker submissions, property schedules, loss runs, policy forms, endorsements. These documents arrive in every format imaginable (scanned PDFs, semi-structured Excel, email attachments), and then have to be reconciled, checked, and entered into systems that mostly don’t talk to one another. Meanwhile, the workforce is aging; one widely cited estimate suggests the American insurance industry could lose more than 400K workers by 2026, even as more than 3M professionals still spend most of their time on manual data entry and document review.Previously, there were two reasons this stayed stubbornly human: machines were bad at reading messy documents, and the rule trees required to model insurance logic were too brittle to maintain. Knowing when a “cat” was a catastrophe rather than an animal was not something you could embed in a template.The arrival of LLMs changed that calculus. If you could combine an LLM’s ability to read with a serious, industry-specific understanding of insurance, maybe you could build something more interesting than yet another dashboard. Think: An AI colleague of sorts who could do the grinding work and leave the humans to decide what to bind or decline.That, at least, was the hypothesis. To test it, they bought donuts.There is something faintly absurd about the co-founder of a Bay Area AI company driving around the Bay Area with a box of donuts, knocking on the doors of insurance agencies like a pharma rep in a previous era. But this is exactly what Aman did.“We literally went door to door,” he said, laughing. “Box of donuts, no appointments. ‘Hey, I know we’re disturbing your day, but can we talk to you about what you do?’”Part of the exercise was ethnographic. They needed to see, with their own eyes, how underwriters and brokers actually spent their days: where the spreadsheets lived, which PDFs they ignored until the last minute, which “systems of record” were silently bypassed by forwarding emails.Part of it was cultural. Insurance is still, in many lines, ‘a specific kind of individual’s relationship’ industry. As two South Asian founders from IIT Bombay with little formal background in insurance, Aman and Sashank needed to know if they could earn trust here, or if they would be better off chasing a different vertical.They found, somewhat to their surprise, that the relationship orientation worked in their favor. Agents and underwriters made time. People answered questions. The donuts probably helped. The discomfort of door-knocking gave way to a delighted discovery: these were pragmatic people who cared about their customers,their software, and had a clear sense of which tasks they would gladly offload.Those early days are still etched in the way Aman talks about the company. Insurance is not “slow to adopt technology,” he insists. The tech simply hasn’t been good enough, tailored enough, to justify the pain of change.“If we can build good tech that actually understands their world,” he said, “it should solve a lot of their problems.”Strip away the jargon, and FurtherAI’s core product is that it reads documents, moves data, and follows rules on behalf of insurance teams. The company calls it an “AI workspace for insurance”, a kind of operating layer that sits between a carrier’s email inboxes, rating engines, broker portals, and policy admin systems.Here’s one way to picture it.Imagine you’re an underwriter at a mid-sized specialty carrier. On Monday morning, you open your inbox to a dozen new submissions from brokers: each one a package of applications, engineering reports, loss histories, spreadsheets, and the occasional scanned PDF someone faxed in 2007. Your job is to decide which risks to quote, which to decline, and which to refer for more information.In the traditional workflow, you’d start manually extracting key data points: addresses, limits, deductibles, and prior losses into your underwriting workbench. You’d cross-check the numbers against your own guidelines: appetite by class and geography, aggregation limits, underwriting authority thresholds. For renewals, you’d dig up last year’s policy and compare terms clause by clause. All of this is mentally taxing.In the FurtherAI version of that day, the submissions are fed through an AI “teammate” that has been trained specifically on insurance documents. It knows that “cat” in a property schedule probably means catastrophe, not a pet. It can tell the difference between “named windstorm coverage excluded” and “windstorm deductible applies.” It parses the submissions, fills in the required fields in your internal systems, flags missing data, compares policies, and presents you with a clean summary plus exceptions.One of FurtherAI’s differentiators, and the reason they insist on calling themselves “insurance-native,” is that each customer uploads their own underwriting guidelines, rating factors, and routing rules. The AI learns those and applies them consistently, rather than imposing a standard model on everyone.Carriers and brokers using FurtherAI now process premiums each year through the platform, automating tasks from submission intake and policy comparisons to compliance checks and, increasingly, parts of claims handling.FurtherAI has gained enough traction that’s helped the company raise a $25M Series A in October, led by a16z, which brought its total funding to about $30M, one of the larger early-stage AI bets in the insurance space.Aman is fond of a simple metaphor when he talks about AI strategy. The smartest move, he argues, is to build what’s core, and buy what scales.Training the largest AI models now costs hundreds of millions of dollars and carries all the operational risk that implies. For most insurers, building a proprietary model end-to-end makes little sense. But buying a generic model and expecting it to understand the nuances of an engineering report, or a layered property program, is equally naïve.FurtherAI’s answer is to sit in between. The company uses a mix of large language models under the hood(a “multi-LLM stack” in the current jargon), but wraps them in insurance-specific data structures, workflows, and human-in-the-loop designs.For each client, a “forward-deployed” AI engineer works alongside underwriters or operations staff to map their current processes, tune the workflows, and agree on what the AI is allowed to do autonomously versus what should always be reviewed.Although the longer-term plan is still to be realized, the direction of travel is clear. McKinsey and others have started talking about “agentic AI”: systems that can string together multiple tasks to execute a workflow, and insurance, with its stable logic and paper-heavy processes, is a natural candidate.The question, then, is whether AI will show up as a blunt cost-cutting instrument, or as something closer to Aman's grandmother’s definition: a trusted second brain that lets humans do more of the work that actually matters to them.If Aman is the storyteller of FurtherAI, his co-founder, Sashank Gondala, is the engineer in the background making sure the story holds together.They met as undergraduates at IIT Bombay: Aman the hardworking generalist who threw himself into student politics and leadership roles, Sashank the one who simply “looked really smart.” Aman still calls him “the smartest person I’ve ever met,” and does so with incredible admiration.After IIT, Sashank went on to do a master’s in computer science with a focus on ML at GeorgiaTech, and then joined Apple as a language modeling scientist, working on the core models that power Siri. Every time Siri mangled Aman's name, he would send Sashank a teasing message. Gradually, the pair began to talk less about pronunciation and more about what else this kind of tech could do.The division of labor at FurtherAI is typical of many founder pairs: Aman sells; Sashank builds. But in industries like insurance, the fact that the person building the models has spent years sweating the edge cases of human language is part of the pitch.If you are not an underwriter in Cleveland or a broker in Dallas, you might reasonably wonder why you should care about the automation of insurance workflows.Part of the answer is pedestrian: cost. In most lines of insurance, somewhere between 25 and 40 cents of every premium dollar goes to operating expense: processing, administration, distribution. If AI-based automation can safely cut that expense ratio, the savings can show up as cheaper premiums or better coverage.Part of it is about resilience. Insurance is where many of society’s slow-burn crises show up first. Healthcare cost inflation becomes a set of choices about which drugs and procedures plans will cover. Each of these decisions is mediated through documents and workflows. Making those workflows faster and more transparent can make it easier for humans to see what they’re deciding.And part of it is about work itself. In almost every white-collar industry, there is a running argument about AI: will it replace us or help us? The unsatisfying but likely accurate answer is “both, depending.”What makes the FurtherAI story interesting, beyond the funding round and the logos on the slide, is that it takes seriously the idea that some work should disappear. Not the judgment calls, not the relationship building, but the cut-and-paste toil that, if you’re honest, no one will miss.There is still risk here. Automation can become an excuse for headcount reduction rather than a chance to invest in better service. AI systems are only as good as the data they’re trained on and the guardrails around them. Privacy and regulatory compliance in insurance are table stakes.Aman likes to joke that in one evening at a friend’s wedding, he found both his life partner and his work partner.He had gone reluctantly, pulled there by a phone call and “a lot of melodrama” from the groom, and ran into an old IIT classmate who was doing her MBA at Wharton. She tried to set him up with a friend. But he was interested in her. There were numbers exchanged, some via back-channels, and then, gradually, a relationship that would require a more consequential decision.At the time, Aman was running his first company in India. She would be in the Bay Area. So how would they make it work? “That’s the last thing I want to worry about,” he told her. “I’ll figure it out.”Moving countries for love meant leaving a company he had built, dealing with visas, and starting again in a place where his network was thinner. The old voices in the kirana shop (hurry up, life is long), were suddenly in tension again. He decided, as he tends to, by taking the next step and trusting the pattern.“When that happens in one evening,” he likes to say now, “imagine what can happen in a year.”There is a similar mixture of impatience and patience in how he talks about the future of FurtherAI. The near-term goal is audacious but conventional: build a billion-dollar company, take it public, justify the confidence of investors like Andreessen Horowitz and the early carriers who bet on them.The longer-term ambition is more modest and, in its way, more demanding: build something that his father and grandfather would recognize as worthwhile when they read about it in the paper. A company that makes the daily lives of people inside it kinder. And less frantic.On Saturdays, he doesn’t work. He and his wife have chai, take swing lessons at the golf range, sometimes go for a hike. He meditates more than he used to. The boy who grew up believing that Sundays were for the shop has chosen, consciously, to step away one day a week. The micro has shifted.In Bhopal, his grandmother still wakes up at 4 to pray, still calls her grandson with questions when she has them. She is amused by the idea that her off-hand description (“Aman’s Intelligence”) might be the kernel of his philosophy about AI. But it fits.If the future of work in insurance, or in any industry, is going to be mediated by machines that read, write, and act on our behalf, then the question isn’t just how powerful those machines are. It’s who they feel like when they pick up the phone.Aman’s bet, with FurtherAI, is that they should feel less like a black box and more like a trusted grandchild: someone who clears the busywork, remembers your rules, and gives you back the one resource his father and grandfather never stopped arguing about.Time.","Aman Gour is the co-founder and CEO of FurtherAI, a company that uses AI to improve insurance workflows.

'Furious' Trump 'SNAPS' At Zelensky As Ukraine 'Refuses Surrender' To Putin | Geneva Talks Teeter

Asian equities began the week on a firmer footing as expectations for a US interest rate cut lifted sentiment across the region, even as oil prices slipped on progress in Russia-Ukraine peace efforts.Market confidence improved after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams indicated there was still “room for a further adjustment” at the Fed’s 9–10 December meeting, reported AFP.His remarks pushed the probability of a rate cut to around 70%, up sharply from earlier levels.As per CNBC, Williams suggested labour-market weakness poses a bigger economic threat than higher inflation.The shift in expectations helped Asian stocks rebound from last week’s sell-off, when fears of a tech-sector bubble—particularly in AI-linked shares—triggered a broad retreat.As per AFP, Hong Kong and Seoul jumped more than 1% on Monday, with Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Taipei also rising.South Korea’s Kospi was 1.13% higher, according to CNBC, while Samsung climbed over 4% in early trade.Japan’s markets were shut for a holiday.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 25,568.08, while China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1%.US futures also advanced after a solid Friday session on Wall Street.In Australia, CNBC reported that Qube shares surged nearly 20% after receiving an A$11.6 billion takeover offer from Macquarie Asset Management, while BHP added 0.4% after ruling out a merger with Anglo American.Alongside the equity rebound, cryptocurrencies remained under pressure. Bitcoin hovered near $87,000, up from last week’s trough but still far below its $126,200 record.Crude prices, meanwhile, edged lower. Brent was down 0.22% at $62.42 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate slipped 0.26% to $57.91, as per Reuters.The drop extended last week’s losses, driven by concerns that a breakthrough in Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations could see sanctions rolled back and previously restricted Russian crude return to the market.US President Donald Trump has set a Thursday deadline for progress, though European leaders are seeking revisions.According to Reuters, IG analyst Tony Sycamore said the sell-off was mainly fuelled by Trump’s strong push for a peace deal, which markets viewed as a “fast track” to unlocking substantial Russian supply.He added that talks overshadowed the immediate impact of fresh US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, which have stranded nearly 48 million barrels of Russian oil at sea.A strengthening US dollar has added further pressure, with the dollar index hitting its highest level since May, Reuters noted, making crude more expensive for non-US buyers.Asia-Pacific traders now await US producer price data later this week—one of the few remaining indicators before the Fed meets—after the delay of other releases due to the US government shutdown.A stronger-than-expected reading could complicate the Fed’s decisions despite recent labour-market weakness.","Hong Kong and Seoul jumped more than 1% on Monday, with Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Taipei also rising.

US-Venezuela tensions: Airlines cancel flights from Caracas; FAA warns of unsafe airspace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-venezuela-tensions-airlines-cancel-flights-from-caracas-faa-warns-of-unsafe-airspace/articleshow/125516494.cms,"(AP)

Venezuela CUT OFF, U.S. Forces Surround Maduro; Global Airlines Halt Flights Ahead Of U.S. Attack

Multiple international airlines suspended their departures from Venezuela on Saturday, following a US aviation alert warning of unsafe conditions in the country’s airspace. The cancellations come amid heightened tensions as the United States prepares a new phase of operations targeting Venezuela, raising concerns about the stability of the region.Gol of Brazil, Avianca of Colombia and TAP Air Portugal pulled their scheduled flights from Caracas, according to Flightradar24 and updates from Simon Bolivar Maiquetia International Airport. Colombia’s aviation authority said there were “potential risks” for aircraft operating near Maiquetia because of worsening security and increased military presence in the area.TAP Air Portugal said its Saturday and upcoming Tuesday services would not operate. “This decision follows information issued by the United States aviation authorities, which indicates that safety conditions in Venezuelan airspace are not guaranteed,” the airline told Reuters.Spain’s Iberia also decided to pause flights to Caracas starting Monday, although the company’s Saturday service to Madrid took off.“The company will assess the situation to decide when to resume flights to that country,” its spokesperson said.Other airlines, including Copa Airlines and Wingo, continued their scheduled operations from the airport. Latam Airlines also canceled its Bogotá flight planned for Sunday, according to Flightradar24.The FAA notice cited the “worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela,” cautioning that the environment posed risks to civil aircraft at all flight levels. The advisory comes as the Trump administration increases its military presence in the Caribbean, including deploying a major aircraft carrier, multiple warships, and F-35 fighter jets.In addition to these maneuvers, four US officials told Reuters that Washington is preparing a new phase of operations against Venezuela, which could include covert actions aimed at weakening or potentially removing President Nicolás Maduro from power. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the plans.Maduro, who has led Venezuela since 2013, has repeatedly accused the US of trying to unseat him and insists that Venezuelan citizens and the military are prepared to resist any foreign intervention.","Gol of Brazil, Avianca of Colombia and TAP Air Portugal pulled their scheduled flights from Caracas.

Bitcoin fell sharply on Friday, closing at $80,553, while ether also hit a four-month low, as cryptocurrencies led a sell-off in riskier assets. Analysts warned that dropping below $80,000 could bring even bigger losses for the world’s largest digital currency.The decline comes amid investor concerns about expensive tech stocks and uncertainty over near-term US interest rate decisions. Cryptocurrencies, often seen as a measure of market risk appetite, have reflected weak sentiment in the markets, with AI-focused stocks falling and volatility rising.Bitcoin has lost 12% in the past week, wiping out its gains for the year, and ether is down nearly 19% so far in 2025. The drop comes after a strong rally earlier this year that pushed bitcoin above $120,000 in October, helped by favorable global regulations for crypto. Analysts said the market remains sensitive after last month’s record single-day liquidation of more than $19 billion in positions.""If it's telling a story about risk sentiment as a whole, then things could start to get really, really ugly, and that's the concern now,"" said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, as quoted by Reuters.The fall also puts pressure on crypto treasury companies, which hold large amounts of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets.Standard Chartered said a drop below $90,000 could leave around half of these holdings “underwater,” meaning the assets are worth less than what was paid. Some firms may need to raise funds or sell part of their holdings, which could push prices lower.Listed companies hold about 4% of all bitcoin and 3.1% of ether, according to Standard Chartered.Citi analyst Alex Saunders noted that $80,000 is an important level, around the average price that bitcoin is held at in exchange-traded funds. Market tracker CoinGecko said the total value of all cryptocurrencies has fallen by roughly $1.2 trillion in the last six weeks.Shares of crypto treasury companies have also dropped. Strategy (MSTR.O), the largest firm in this group, has seen its stock fall 61% since July, leaving it down nearly 40% for the year. JP Morgan said Strategy could be removed from some MSCI equity indexes, which could force further selling by funds that track the company. Japanese company Metaplanet (3350.T) has dropped about 80% from its June peak, according to Reuters.Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra Markets, said past bitcoin sell-offs in 2018 and 2022 saw prices fall 75% to 80%. If that happens again, bitcoin could drop as low as $25,000. ""I am not saying we are in crypto winter. Just offering a reminder that 75%/80% drawdowns have been part of the game in bitcoin,"" he said.","Bitcoin closes at $80,553, while ether hits four-month low.

US President Donald Trump once again defended his aggressive tariff strategy, claiming it is generating “TRILLIONS of Dollars” for America and has functioned as a powerful tool to prevent international conflicts.In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump wrote, “We are taking in TRILLIONS of Dollars in Tariffs and Investment Dollars from foreign lands because of Tariffs. I have stopped 5 of the eight WARS directly because of the threat of Tariffs if they don’t stop fighting or, better yet, if they start.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that he has solved 8 wars across the globe, including brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan during the May standoff by threatening them with 350 per cent tariffs.Trump further argued that tariffs are vital to the US economy and security. “There is almost no Inflation, and the worst in USA History under Sleepy Joe Biden,” he said, adding, “The Stock Market just hit an ALL-TIME HIGH for the 48th time in 9 months.”Turning to his critics, Trump targeted Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo, the Koch network, and foreign governments for “ripping off"" the US through the use of their own tariffs.Trump’s criticism of Leo follows a public fallout earlier this year. In May, he attacked his once ally after the US Court of International Trade struck down his tariffs, calling him a “sleazebag” who “probably hates America.”The latest remarks add to Trump’s ongoing defence of his tariff-driven agenda, which he continues to frame as central to US strength both at home and abroad.","US President Donald Trump once again defended his aggressive tariff strategy.

Manufacturing slowdown: US factory activity slows as tariffs push up prices; services sector cushions overall growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/manufacturing-slowdown-us-factory-activity-slows-as-tariffs-push-up-prices-services-sector-cushions-overall-growth/articleshow/125506522.cms,"AI image

Manufacturing hit by rising prices and weak demand



Tariffs squeeze households, sentiment weakens



Services sector keeps overall activity steady



US manufacturing slipped to a four-month low in November as tariffs pushed up prices and dampened demand.According to news agency Reuters, the slowdown caused a build-up of unsold goods, raising concerns that it may drag down wider economic growth.S&P Global said the flash US manufacturing PMI eased to 51.9 from 52.5 in October, with new orders dropping to 51.3 and inventories rising to the highest level recorded in the survey.Chris Williamson of S&P Global Market Intelligence said manufacturers faced “a worrying combination of slower new orders growth and a record rise in finished goods stock,” cautioning that output may weaken further unless demand revives.Reuters reported that consumers are increasingly reluctant to buy long-lasting manufactured goods. The University of Michigan’s latest survey showed a sharp fall in purchasing conditions, adding that “consumers remain frustrated about the persistence of high prices and weakening incomes.”US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have pushed up import costs, placing additional pressure on lower- and middle-income families.A recent stock-market sell-off has also dented confidence among wealthier Americans, who had earlier supported spending.Economist Sung Won Sohn was quoted by Reuters as saying that those at the lower-income end “will probably not spend very much,” adding that uncertainty in markets “is going to hurt even the spending of wealthier people, especially retirees.”Despite the factory-sector slowdown, broader business activity remained solid.The US Composite PMI Output Index rose to 54.8, supported by a stronger services sector. Reuters reported that services PMI climbed to 55.0, driven by better new business orders and improved confidence linked to expectations of further rate cuts, the end of the 43-day government shutdown and easing political concerns.Consumer sentiment inched up to 51 in the University of Michigan survey, though it stayed below October’s level. Joanne Hsu, who heads the survey, said sentiment among households with large stock holdings dropped due to late-month market declines.Inflation pressures remained elevated, with businesses reporting higher input costs and increased prices for goods and services.Consumers also expect stronger inflation in the next year, Reuters said, even as five-year expectations eased slightly to 3.4%.Though the PMI suggested no sharp deterioration in the labour market, hiring softened marginally, with private-sector employment slipping to 51.0 amid tariff-related cost concerns.","US manufacturing slipped to a four-month low in November as tariffs pushed up prices and dampened demand.

IPO market cools after shutdown: US listings slow as SEC backlog delays approvals; tech slump adds pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ipo-market-cools-after-shutdown-us-listings-slow-as-sec-backlog-delays-approvals-tech-slump-adds-pressure/articleshow/125506227.cms,"Several recent IPOs have lost momentum after strong debuts

Broader markets weigh on sentiment

Investor appetite remains strong despite volatility

Key IPO candidates for 2026 include Databricks, Canva, and Plaid, AP reported.

The strong run in US initial public offerings has lost momentum due to the government shutdown and increased investor caution, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) works through a backlog of regulatory filings, according to market participants.Many IPOs expected in late 2025 are likely to be pushed to 2026 as the SEC clears “hundreds of registration statements,” AP reported. Listings that did debut recently have seen limited gains amid concerns that stocks have become expensive following another year of double-digit market returns.“A backlogged SEC, the approaching holiday slowdown, and pressure on AI and other tech stocks are all weighing on hopes for a near-term rebound,” Bill Smith, CEO of Renaissance Capital, said in a note to investors.Despite delays, several IPOs already advanced through the regulatory pipeline are expected to list in November and December.Central Bancompany, which went public after the shutdown, raised $373 million through its IPO on Thursday. November remains on track to be among the slowest IPO months of 2025, Renaissance Capital said.Upcoming large listings could include medical supplies company Medline, potentially raising up to $5 billion in December, while cryptocurrency technology firm BitGo also remains a candidate for a listing next month.Shares of Figma, which tripled on debut after pricing at $33 per share in July, are now trading slightly above their IPO price. Swedish buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, priced at $40 in September, is now trading near $29.Cloud services company CoreWeave, listed at $40 in March, jumped initially but has retreated to around $72. Software firm Navan, listed at $25 during the shutdown, is now trading near $15.The S&P 500 has fallen 3.5% in November, driven by a slide in technology shares following concerns about valuations tied to artificial-intelligence-linked stocks. However, the index is still up more than 12% this year, while the Nasdaq has gained over 15%.Renaissance Capital’s IPO Index is down about 0.8% this year and has lagged the S&P 500 since mid-October.“What that shows is that investors very quickly monetized, they didn't want to take the long-term risk,” said Samuel Kerr, head of global equity capital markets at Mergermarket.Analysts say high valuations in public markets may continue to push investors toward IPOs as alternative entry points.“Increasingly, as a money manager, you have to find other places to make money and typically, IPOs are that place,” said David Kaufman, partner and co-chair of the corporate & securities practice at Thompson Coburn LLP, AP quoted. “You continue to have all these large mutual funds and money managers with excess cash and no place to put this cash.”The slowdown masks a surge in behind-the-scenes activity, Kaufman added: “It’s a busy time for lawyers and bankers trying to tee things up for the first and second quarter of next year.”",Many IPOs expected in late 2025 are likely to be pushed to 2026.

Are we all living inside an AI bubble? Inside circular deals and the quiet financial loop they created,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/are-living-in-an-ai-bubble-inside-chatgpt-openai-microsoft-anthropic-nvidia-circular-deals-and-thier-financial-loop/articleshow/125504773.cms,"What does it mean?

and are we in an

AI bubble

?

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Inside the loop: What are circular Deals





The loop is tight, lucrative, and increasingly enormous.

But why do they exist?

So are we in a bubble?





first need to look at the scale of the investments:

A market bigger than pharma

OpenAI’s revenue and the pricing question





Would raising prices fix OpenAI’s financial pressure?

How Oracle became an unlikely winner





Oracle invests in the infrastructure OpenAI needs.

OpenAI commits to spending billions on Oracle Cloud to run its models.

Oracle gains a marquee client and a narrative shift that boosts investor confidence.

Echoes of the dot-com bubble - and what burst it





It wasn’t one factor it was a cluster of external shocks:

Antitrust action against Microsoft: The US government’s lawsuit rattled confidence in the entire tech sector. The perception of regulatory overreach pushed investors to reassess risk. Corporate accounting scandals: MicroStrategy famously restated its financial results, triggering panic around revenue inflation across the industry. The broader macro unwind: The housing market began showing cracks; interest rates shifted; capital costs rose. Companies dependent on cheap financing suddenly found credit scarce. Telecom overbuild and bad debt: Cisco, Lucent and others extended supplier financing to customers who were effectively insolvent. When those loans went bad, the write-downs cascaded.

Has AI faced a similar shock yet?





Regulatory scrutiny has been loud but not existential.

OpenAI’s internal governance turmoil did not derail the company.

Supply chain shortages have slowed but not stopped GPU availability.

High interest rates have not dried up capital for AI megaprojects.

So, this is sustainable?





Investors are split.

The bullish case

AI is transformative Compute demand is compounding Early investment will pay off across decades Circular deals are simply a modern way to bootstrap hyper-scale infrastructure

The bearish case

The sector’s valuations rely on uninterrupted optimism Cash flows are disguised by internal loops Capital expenditure requirements are too high for current revenue One external shock could trigger cascading losses

A revolution built on a loop





Three years ago, generative AI was barely on anyone’s radar. Three months ago, circular deals were whispered about only in private meetings at big banks. Weeks and days ago, these loops were still a niche topic. Today, they are all anyone on Wall Street can talk about.As investments swell: from $100 billion chip deals to multi-gigawatt data-centre projects, questions are mounting.The first question is:A growing number of AI firms and their partners are engaging in “circular” financing, a loop in which the same companies that pour money into AI start-ups are also the ones selling them the infrastructure they need to survive.It has created what can be described as an ouroboros ecosystem, a self-feeding financial creature devouring its own tail. And as the numbers balloon from $100 billion chip deals to multi-gigawatt data-centre projects questions are rising about how sustainable this loop really is.Circular deals are straightforward in theory but unusually powerful in practice. An AI company receives immense investment from a tech giant and then commits to spending that money back with the same investor on cloud compute, chips, and infrastructure.Take one of the clearest examples: Microsoft and Nvidia’s multi-billion-dollar commitments to Anthropic. The start-up received around $15 billion from the two giants, but simultaneously committed to spend $30 billion on Microsoft’s Azure cloud and Nvidia GPUs. On paper, it looks like a huge show of confidence in Anthropic. In reality, a large portion of that investment will flow straight back into the pockets of Microsoft and Nvidia via long-term infrastructure contracts. OpenAI , the sector’s flagship, takes this circularity even further. Nvidia has reportedly pledged up to $100 billion in investment; OpenAI, in turn, is one of the largest buyers of Nvidia GPUs on the planet. AMD struck similar agreements, providing next-generation chips while granting OpenAI warrants that allow it to buy a stake in AMD for a symbolic price meaning OpenAI pays AMD for hardware while simultaneously holding equity that benefits if AMD succeeds.Meanwhile, Oracle is deeply embedded as OpenAI’s cloud backend. The two companies are building new AI super-data-centres under a partnership nominally worth over $300 billion. OpenAI receives compute capacity now but is committed to paying Oracle roughly the same amount over the next five years.SoftBank’s arrangements with OpenAI operate in the same space: it injects capital into the company and simultaneously builds infrastructure for OpenAI’s Stargate project, which OpenAI then commits to paying for across the next decade.The AI boom’s most limited resource is not talent or data, it's computers. Training frontier AI models requires hundreds of thousands of GPUs and vast amounts of power.This is why many deals are measured not in dollars but in gigawatts (GW).A single gigawatt is a staggering unit:1 GW ≈ the electricity consumption of 750,000 homes.Next-generation AI data centres increasingly require sites of 1–4 GW each. OpenAI’s planned megasite in Texas is expected to consume power on the scale of a small country. These sites need dedicated substations, transmission lines, cooling farms and, in some cases, on-site power generation.Because the capital expenditure is so immense, AI companies need partners that can supply cash and infrastructure. Cloud providers and chipmakers fit the bill but they recoup their investment by locking start-ups into massive, long-term spending commitments.The economics are daunting: McKinsey estimates that meeting global AI compute demand will require $7 trillion in capital expenditure by 2030. Bain has issued similar warnings, noting that the gap between current AI revenue and required future revenue to sustain that expenditure is in the hundreds of billions annually.A simple way to answer whether there is an AI bubble is to start with the generative models themselves. For example, when ChatGPT is asked, “Are we in an AI bubble?” it responds: “Yes, (in the short term).”“Short-term: Yes, there’s over-exuberance. Some of the money is flowing into speculative plays, and not every AI startup will survive,” ChatGPT opined.“Medium to Long-term: Even if there’s a “pop” or correction, I don’t think AI goes away. The infrastructure (data centers, chips, cloud) and real use-cases are likely to persist and mature,” it said in its long term prediction.Elon Musk's Grok agreed that we are in an AI bubble but offered an optimistic view, saying it’s not “the kind that will inevitably end in total catastrophe like the dot-com crash or 2008.”“Yes, I think we're in an AI bubble—though not the kind that will inevitably end in total catastrophe like the dot-com crash or 2008. It's more like a frothy, speculative swell built on genuine technological promise, where valuations have raced ahead of near-term realities, and a correction feels overdue,” Musk’s chatbot said.Gemini described the current moment as a small bubble of investor excitement sitting on top of a much larger, long-term technological shift. In its view, only weaker players and short-term bets are at risk, because the underlying technology remains solid.But to really understand if there is a bubble, weNothing illustrates the speculative scale better than Nvidia. The company’s market capitalisation is now larger than the entire global pharmaceutical industry combined. The comparison is striking:Pharma is a century-old sector with regulated demand, stable revenue and essential products.Nvidia is riding a single theme - AI compute whose long-term commercial returns are still unproven.Investors have embraced the idea that AI will reshape the global economy. But the sheer size of these valuations has led some analysts to warn that even small disappointments in AI adoption could trigger disproportionately large corrections.This is one reason high-profile investors like Michael Burry famous for “The Big Short” have reportedly shorted companies tied closely to the AI boom, including OpenAI-related plays and Palantir. His bearish stance signals that not everyone is convinced the sector can sustain its current velocity.OpenAI reportedly generated around $12 billion in annual revenue. That figure represents enormous traction for an eight-year-old company but its operating costs still exceed its income. Training frontier models like GPT-5 costs billions, and inference expenses (the cost of running the models) rise with user demand.This raises an uncomfortable question:Possibly but at a cost.OpenAI’s mainstream foothold depends heavily on consumer adoption and developer usage. Its subscription tiers, API pricing and enterprise contracts are designed to drive volume, not maximise margin. A significant price hike could slow the growth that its entire valuation depends on.Moreover, the company faces fierce competition: Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, and a rapidly rising open-source ecosystem. In a market shaped by hype and experimentation, raising prices too aggressively risks sending developers elsewhere.Thus OpenAI is caught in the classic innovator’s dilemma:Charge more and risk losing scale, or maintain low prices and burn cash.Oracle might appear an unusual beneficiary of the AI boom but its entanglement with OpenAI is one of the most strategic plays in the industry.Oracle’s cloud business historically lagged behind AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Enter AI: the OpenAI partnership has repositioned Oracle as a critical provider of GPU capacity, filling its data centres with high-margin compute workloads.The $300 billion-plus partnership is effectively a circular loop:The arrangement is lucrative but also risky. If AI growth slows, Oracle could be left with overbuilt infrastructure, echoing the telecom overcapacity of the dot-com era.The parallels with the late-1990s tech boom are more than rhetorical. The mechanism is similar: companies inflated each other’s valuations through investment loops and customer financing schemes.But the more important lesson comes from why the dot-com bubble burst.What killed the dot-com boom was not the failure of the technology, it was the collapse of the financial scaffolding.AI is now building an even bigger, more interconnected one.So far, the AI sector has weathered every potential disruption:In other words: the external shock hasn’t arrived yet.But history suggests that when investment loops are this tightly interwoven, it only takes one disruption, a regulatory hit, a liquidity crunch, an accounting scandal, or a sudden slowdown in AI adoption for the system to reprice violently.In this sense, the AI boom stands at a crossroads similar to 1999–2000: dazzling technological promise intertwined with fragile financial engineering.Circular AI financing is brilliant, aggressive and deeply risky. It has enabled the fastest infrastructure build-out in tech history, compressed into just a few years. But it has also created a tightly coupled financial ecosystem where companies invest in each other, buy from each other and depend heavily on mutual success.If AI delivers the productivity surge its champions predict, the investment loops will look visionary. If it falters, the ouroboros may finally bite too hard and unravel the most expensive technology cycle in a generation.Time, and perhaps an external shock, will reveal which way the loop bends.","A growing number of AI firms and their partners are engaging in ‘circular’ financing, a loop in which the same companies that pour money into AI start-ups are also selling them the infrastructure they need to survive.

US Shutdown ‘Ends’ After 40 Days; Senate Passes Bill After Dems ‘COMPROMISE’ With House GOP | WATCH

The US government will not release official inflation or jobs figures for October after the record-long shutdown prevented statisticians from gathering essential data, leaving the Federal Reserve without two major indicators ahead of its December policy meeting.The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed on Friday that the October consumer price index (CPI) has been cancelled because staff were unable to collect the survey information in time, as per Reuters.“BLS is unable to retroactively collect these data,” the agency said, adding that only a few indexes based on nonsurvey data could be reconstructed. Where possible, October values will be issued alongside November’s CPI report on 18 December.The shutdown—which lasted 43 days from early October to mid-November—also forced the cancellation of the October employment report.While October nonfarm payroll figures will be combined with November data on 16 December, the unemployment rate for that month “will never be known”, reported Reuters.A similar message was delivered in Washington on Friday, with the BLS reiterating that survey-based data simply “was not gathered” during the stoppage, reported news agency AFP.The agency noted that CPI collection typically relies on in-person visits to retailers, including supermarkets, and telephone interviews. Household survey data for the jobs report is gathered in the same way.The cancellations have intensified uncertainty for the Federal Reserve, which meets on 9–10 December.Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently compared navigating the economy without standard datasets to “driving in the fog”, reported The Guardian.“What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” he said last month.Fed officials were already under pressure, with inflation still above typical levels and policymakers weighing whether to deliver another rate cut.A speech by New York Fed President John Williams on Friday added to expectations of a possible adjustment, saying he saw “room for a further adjustment in the near term”, according to The Guardian.The September jobs report, released with delays because of the shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added but the unemployment rate rising to its highest level since 2021.The full October labour market report will never be published, although the job creation figure for that month will appear alongside November’s release a week after the Fed’s meeting.The shutdown has already pushed back a series of economic indicators, including retail sales and trade data, as per AFP.It comes as President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to complicate inflation pressures, with some Fed officials considering holding rates steady for longer.",US government will not release official inflation or jobs figures for October after record-long shutdown.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

From ending at 3 week low last week to claiming back to 6 month high – markets have broken out of its previous range seen between 23900 and 24400. A new range window has now opened up on Nifty between 24400 – 25400 with volatility seen at elevated levels for the balance of this week. All the sharp gains at the start of this week were on the back of the ceasefire agreement announced over the weekend added by a sweetener to global equities on a temporary agreement reached between US and China on tariffs. 24400 now acts as fresh support while 24900/25400 can now be seen as possible targets on upside.Bank Nifty has reversed its course from the 5 year trendline’s polarity support wherein it also completed its initial downside target. Unless a closing below the same (53500) is not seen further downside cannot be seen opening up. For now a range between 54500 and 55900 can be seen playing for this week on the index with a positive bias.Stock is breaking out from a bullish flag formation with an attempt to hit its 200 DMA resistance near the 1700 mark. A higher low formation also confirms the same that sellers are not under control in driving the prices lower any further in this leg. Previous a sloping trendline breakout from a 6-month long correction has been spotted in April 2025, which is helping buyers emerge on dips in the stock.Repeated higher low formations are seen on chart, along with reclamation of 200 DMA, indicating further upside yet to unfold on the same. Initial signs of a huge upside is being formed as the stock has been consolidating in a base formation pattern for the past 26 months. For now, we are looking for a 10% upside in this leg.An inverted head and shoulder formation is seen on daily charts where the stock has given a breakout of the neckline visible at 1600 odd levels. A higher low formation shows early signs of this breakout coming in the short term for targets of 200 DMA resistance floating near 1725 – 1735 band.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Havells, Adani Energy Solutions Ltd, and HCL Technologies Ltd are the top buy calls for today.

Pakistan has obtained the second instalment of special drawing rights amounting to 760 million ($1,023 million) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through the extended fund facility programme.The State Bank of Pakistan announced on X (formerly Twitter) that these funds will be incorporated into its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending May 16, according to a Reuters report.Last week, India abstained from voting at the International Monetary Fund's Executive Board meeting, expressing serious concerns about IMF bailout packages for Pakistan.

"Fashion giant Burberry slashes 1,700 jobs, says strategic shift to boost performance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fashion-giant-burberry-slashes-1700-jobs-says-strategic-shift-to-boost-performance/articleshow/121162188.cms,"Looking for revival



Performance



British fashion giant Burberry announced plans to slash almost one fifth of its global workforce, laying off 1,700 employees. The move comes as a major cost saving move to revive the company’s performance.The cuts come as part of a broader shake-up under chief executive officer Joshua Schulman, who joined the company last year to reverse its years of underperformance and put Burberry back on course.The majority of the job losses will affect office-based roles, and a night shift at the company’s Castleford trench coat factory in England will be scrapped due to overproduction.“Our brand metrics have all shown a significant improvement in the second half versus the first half,” Schulman told journalists on a call, quoted by Reuters.The former Jimmy Choo boss has transitioned Burberry’s focus back to its heritage staples, particularly trench coats and scarves, after previous missteps including aggressive pricing and unclear brand positioning.He has also pinned his hopes on leather accessories which have a higher margin and on designer Daniel Lee.Between 2017 and 2021, the group was run by Marco Gobbetti and designer Riccardo Tisci, the company had tried to establish the group as a high end luxury fashion brand, however, it did not yield much financial success.Schulman replaced Jonathan Akeroyd and is the fourth CEO of the brand in a decade.The shake-up news and better than expected financial results sent the brand’s shares sparing 8% in early trading following the update and better-than-expected financial results. For the financial year ending 29 March 2025, Burberry reported an adjusted operating profit of £26 million, well above analyst expectations of £11 million, helping the brand narrowly avoid a loss.However, the broader luxury market downturn remains a concern. Comparable sales fell 6% in the fourth quarter, though this was slightly better than the 7% drop analysts had forecast.Region wise categorisation showed that sales in the Americas and the Europe, Middle East, India and Africa region, each declined 4% against last year. Similarly, sales in the Asia Pacific area also plunged 9%.Schulman admitted that US consumer behaviour in particular had shown signs of softening. “As we got into Q4, the US customer was keeping their momentum but ... things got a little choppy as we headed into February, particularly in the US market,” he said.The US currently accounts for 19% of Burberry’s clients. While the company did not comment on the potential impact of US tariffs, it did flag “geopolitical developments” as a factor contributing to economic uncertainty. No concrete financial targets were set for the 2026 fiscal year.","The majority of the job losses will affect office-based roles.

While ITR Forms 1 and 4, used by small and medium taxpayers, were notified on April 29, ITR-7, applicable for trusts and charitable institutions, was notified on May 11.One important change has been introduced in ITR-1 and ITR-4, notified on April 29, relating to the reporting of capital gains income from listed equities, as reported by news agency PTI.Now, salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme, having long-term capital gains (LTCG) of up to Rs 1.25 lakh in a financial year, will be able to file ITR-1 and ITR-4, respectively. Earlier, such persons/entities were required to file ITR-2.Under the Income Tax law, LTCG of up to Rs 1.25 lakh from the sale of listed shares and mutual funds is exempt from tax. Gains exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh per annum are subject to 12.5 per cent tax.The last date for filing ITR for individuals and those who do not have to get their accounts audited is July 31.One change which has been introduced in ITR forms 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 pertains to rationalisation of capital gains tax. In Schedule Capital Gains of the ITR, capital gains must now be split based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024.In the Budget presented on July 24, 2024, the government had proposed to lower long-term capital gains tax on real estate to 12.5 per cent without indexation benefit, from 20 per cent with indexation.Indexation benefit allows taxpayers to arrive at the cost price of the property after adjusting for inflation.With this, individuals or HUFs who purchased houses before July 23, 2024, can opt to pay Long Term Capital Gain (LTCG) tax under the new scheme at the rate of 12.5 per cent without indexation or claim the indexation benefit and pay 20 per cent tax.Also, in ITR-3, which is filed by individuals and HUFs having income from profits and gains of business or profession, the threshold for reporting assets and liabilities under 'Schedule AL' has been raised from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore, thus reducing the disclosure burden on middle-income taxpayers.ITR Form 1 (Sahaj) and ITR Form 4 (Sugam) are simpler forms that cater to a large number of small and medium taxpayers.Sahaj can be filed by a resident individual having annual income of up to Rs 50 lakh and who receives income from salary, one house property, other sources (interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000 a year.Sugam can be filed by individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), and firms (other than Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs)) having a total annual income of up to Rs 50 lakh and income from business and profession.ITR-2 is filed by individuals and HUFs not having income from profits and gains in business or profession, but having income from capital gains.ITR-5 is filed by firms, Limited Liability Partnerships, and Cooperative Societies. ITR-6 is filed by companies registered under the Companies Act. ITR-7 is filed by trusts and charitable institutions.","ITR Forms 1 and 4, used by small and medium taxpayers, were notified on April 29.

IREDA takes Gensol to insolvency court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ireda-takes-gensol-to-insolvency-court/articleshow/121172540.cms,"Anmol Singh Jaggi

MUMBAI: Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency on Wednesday filed an insolvency plea against troubled Gensol Engineering over a default of Rs 510 crore, the power financier said in an exchange filing. The application was filed under section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Troubles at Gensol unfolded after a Sebi probe revealed in April that the company’s promoters, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi , used loans from several creditors, taken in the name of Gensol, to buy a luxury flat, inflate Gensol’s stock price, for personal use through their private ventures, and for purposes other than those for which the loans were taken. They were also found to have forged no-default letters from lenders like IREDA and PFC to falsely project that there was no default by the company.In April, IREDA also filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing against Gensol. “Regarding communications from credit rating agencies on the falsified documents, IREDA clarified that it did not issue the letters they referred to. The promoters diluted their shareholdings without lenders’ approval, constituting a breach of contract,” IREDA said.Earlier this week, the Jaggi brothers stepped down from their positions on Gensol’s board, to comply with Sebi’s directive. IREDA and Power Finance Corp lent about Rs 977 crore to Gensol between FY22 and FY24, of which Rs 663 crore was meant for the purchase of electric vehicles that were to be leased by Gensol to its affiliate BluSmart. The ride-hailing firm, also promoted by the Jaggi brothers, suspended operations last month with its investors working on a resolution plan to revive the startup, sources said.The latest move by IREDA is the first instance of a creditor taking Gensol to the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ). Over a month, Gensol’s stock has crashed nearly 54% on the BSE — often hitting the daily lower circuit.","Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency on Wednesday filed an insolvency plea against troubled Gensol Engineering over a default of Rs 510 crore.

MUMBAI: Following an understanding reached between India and Pakistan over the weekend on the stoppage of military action, a semblance of normalcy seems to be setting in the border towns. Businesses are largely resuming full operations, and employees are returning to offices in these areas. Companies with a wider coverage of manufacturing and other processes, however, are treading with caution, ready to maintain operational flexibility and precautionary measures if the need arises. They are tracking directives from the local authorities and the situation on the ground.As of Monday night, there were drone intrusions in some border areas, resulting in blackouts in places like Amritsar despite the ceasefire, TOI reported. Mother Dairy stated that it is fully operational as of now but continues to be watchful.“We have operations in procurement, processing, and sales in select markets of the bordering states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Jammu & Kashmir. Following the unfortunate incident last month and the situation thereafter, we promptly issued advisories to our teams, prioritising their safety and compliance with directives from local authorities.While the situation continues to evolve, we are monitoring the developments closely and remain hopeful (for things to get better),” Manish Bandlish, managing director at Mother Dairy, told TOI.In the case of manufacturing units, businesses typically operate in three shifts. Last week, after tensions escalated between the two countries, some FMCG companies discontinued night shifts at their factories. Dabur, which suspended the night shift for its Jammu factory, said that all the shifts are operational now and its outstation employees have also returned. “…we discontinued night operations and updated the office time so that people could leave early and get home before dark. It was a matter of a few days, and everything is back to normal now,” said Deepshikha Thakur, Chief People Officer at Bikaji Foods International.LT Foods, maker of brands like Daawat, has two manufacturing units in Punjab’s Bhikhiwind and Varpal, both of which are fully functional, said CEO and MD Ashwani Arora. “People in general are still a bit scared, but operations are quite normal now. In terms of business, we are a bit shielded given that 65% of our business comes from exports,” Arora said.","Businesses are largely resuming full operations, and employees are returning to offices in these areas.

What drives external commerical borrowing

MUMBAI: In a strong signal of rising investment in India’s private sector, manufacturing and finance companies received approval to raise a record $11 billion through external commercial borrowings (ECBs) in March 2025. This marks the highest monthly ECB inflow in more than five years, according to data released by RBI.Of the total amount, about $8.3 billion was approved through the automatic route, while nearly $2.7 billion was approved through the approval route. The surge in ECBs highlights the growing confidence in India’s economic prospects and its ability to attract foreign capital.Several prominent companies were among the top recipients of ECB approvals in March. Yuzhan Technology (India), a subsidiary of Taiwan’s Foxconn Group, received approval to raise $220 million for working capital needs. Established in late 2023, Yuzhan focuses on the manufacturing of computer, electronic, and optical products. JSW Steel received approval to raise $900 million to refinance an earlier ECB, while ONGC Videsh and MRPL each received approval to raise $450 million and $500 million, respectively, for similar refinancing purposes. Power Finance Corporation received approval to raise $250 million for onlending, and IndianOil received approval to raise $400 million for refinancing an earlier ECB.Other companies that received approval to borrow included Tata Semiconductor, which secured approval to raise $625 million for a new project, and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India, which received approval for $511 million. JSW Neo received approval to raise $675 million for investment in an overseas joint venture, while Hero Fincorp and Nissan Renault Financial Services received approval for $250 million and $233 million, respectively, for onlending. For the full fiscal year, total ECB proposals amounted to $61.8 billion, a significant increase from the $49 billion raised in FY24. Nearly half of the approvals were for ECBs by financial services companies.The top 10 recipients of ECB approvals in FY25 include major companies such as Reliance Industries, Power Finance Corporation, and JSW Steel. Reliance Industries, for instance, received approval to raise two loans: nearly $3 billion for refinancing earlier ECBs, and another $1 billion for the local sourcing of capital goods. Both loans have maturities ranging from 5 to 12 years.Others include ONGC Videsh, which received approval for $800 million, and companies like Muthoot Finance, Shriram Finance, IIFL Finance, and Tata Capital, which were approved for $750 million each for onlending purposes.",Manufacturing and finance companies received approval to raise a record $11 billion through external commercial borrowings (ECBs) in March 2025.

Tata Power to bid for UP discoms in core business push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-power-to-bid-for-up-discoms-in-core-business-push/articleshow/121172594.cms,"Representative photo

Capex alloted to renewable

MUMBAI: Tata Power plans to bid for two electricity distribution companies in Uttar Pradesh — Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam and Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam — once tender documents are released, said MD Praveer Sinha. This move supports Tata Power’s goal to grow its transmission and distribution (T&D) business, which brings in most of its revenue and a large share of its profits.“Based on our discussions, bid documents are being finalised and are expected by the end of the month. They (UP) are looking to privatise two discoms — Dakshinanchal and Purvanchal — which will be divided into six circles. We will participate actively when the documents are available,” Sinha said.Currently, Tata Power manages electricity distribution in Mumbai, Delhi, Ajmer, and Odisha, serving 12.5 million customers. It aims to have a base of 40 million in 5 years. UP’s goal is to cut losses and improve efficiency in these two discoms. Most likely, govt will choose a public-private partnership , with private companies holding majority stake.Dakshinanchal and Purvanchal serve 42 of UP’s 75 districts. Tata Power improved the financial health of the discoms after it checked into them, which also positions it to capitalise on opportunities arising in the power distribution space. For instance, the profit of the Odisha discom, in which it holds 51% and the Odisha govt owns 49%, increased by 86%, reaching Rs 439 crore in FY25 from Rs 236 crore in FY22. Odisha discom came under Tata Power’s management between June 2020 and April 2021.Tata Power, which plans to enter the small modular nuclear reactor business, is waiting for legal clarity before moving ahead. “We are awaiting amendments to the Nuclear Power Act — specifically civil liability and private sector participation. We expect the amendments to be discussed during the monsoon session. We are preparing with site evaluations, water arrangements, and technology reviews, but our next steps depend on legal clarity,” Sinha said. Tata Steel & Tata Motors, are potential customers for the nuclear power that Tata Power intends to offer as part of its clean energy solution.It plans to spend Rs 25,000 crore on capital expenditure in FY26. Sinha said 50% of this amount will be allocated to renewables, 20% to generation, and 30% to T&D. In FY25, it spent Rs 16,000 crore on capex, falling short of the Rs 20,000-crore target. The reduced spend was attributed to delays in transmission and renewable projects, according to the leadership.Tata Power plans to exit Tata Projects, the contractor that built Parliament building after independence, as it wants to focus on its main businesses. “Tata Power is focused on growth in core businesses: renewables, hydro, transmission, and distribution. We need capital for this, so we have chosen not to allocate funds to non-core ventures,” said Sinha.","Tata Power plans to bid for two electricity distribution companies in Uttar Pradesh.

Rates of retial inflation

NEW DELHI: Kerala was the state with the highest inflation rate in April, while Telangana had the lowest, according to the latest data. This indicates that some large states continue to grapple with price pressures.The retail inflation data for April, released on Tuesday, showed that Kerala had the highest rate at 5.9%, followed by Karnataka and Jammu and Kashmir, both at 4.3%. Telangana recorded the lowest rate at 1.3%, followed by Delhi at 1.8%, and Jharkhand and Rajasthan at 2.2%.Kerala also recorded the highest rural and urban inflation rates. The inflation rate in rural areas was 6.5%, while in urban centres, it was 4.9%. J&K had the second-highest rural inflation rate at 4.6%, while Uttarakhand recorded a 4.9% urban inflation rate, followed by Karnataka at 4.5%. Telangana had the lowest rural inflation rate at 0.4%, and Delhi recorded the lowest urban inflation rate at 1.7% in April.The data showed that 13 states had retail inflation rates lower than the headline rate of 3.2%. In rural areas, 16 states recorded lower inflation, well below the overall 3.2%.An analysis by ratings agency Crisil revealed that the richest segments (top 20%) in both rural and urban areas face a higher burden than their poorer counterparts.This is because core items, which had the highest inflation rate in April, comprise a larger portion of their consumption baskets. “The poorer segments now see a lower inflation rate than the richest, in contrast to the trend seen in fiscal 2025,” said a note from Crisil.The effect of inflation varies across income groups since the share of spending on food, fuel, and core categories differs for different classes. Essential items, such as food and fuel, take up a greater share of the consumption basket for lower-income households.","The retail inflation data for April, released on Tuesday, showed that Kerala had the highest rate at 5.9%.

CHANDIGARH/AMRITSAR: BSF jawan Purnam Kumar Shaw , who had been in the custody of Pakistan Rangers for nearly three weeks, was handed over to India on Wednesday morning. The repatriation took place at 10.30am at the Joint Check Post in Attari, Amritsar, and was carried out peacefully in line with established protocols, the Border Security Force (Punjab Frontier) said in a statement.Read also: Blindfolded, disoriented: Image shows moment BSF jawan Purnam Kumar Shaw was captured by Pakistan Rangers Inspector General (IG), Punjab Frontier, BSF, Atul Fulzele, confirmed that the jawan, Purnam Kumar Shaw, who had been in the custody of Pakistan Rangers since April 23, 2025, was repatriated to India around 10.30am at the Joint Check Post in Attari, Amritsar.“The handover was conducted peacefully and in accordance with established protocols,” said the IG.Shaw was captured a day after the Pahalgam terror attack and was released on the fourth day of the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, which came into effect on May 10.The BSF constable, who had inadvertently crossed the international border along with his service weapon on April 23, was caught by Pakistan Rangers.A BSF official stated that there were no signs of torture or injury marks.A spokesperson of BSF’s Punjab Frontier confirmed, “Today BSF jawan Purnam Kumar Shaw, who had been in the custody of Pakistan Rangers since 23 April 2025, was handed over to India at about 10.30 am through the Joint Check Post Attari, Amritsar.The handover was conducted peacefully and in accordance with established protocols.”Following his return, Shaw was taken for medical examination and debriefing.BSF sources said that under normal circumstances, the jawan would have been returned the same day or the next. However, tensions escalated after the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 people, stalling repatriation talks and flag meetings across the border.The jawan’s wife, a resident of West Bengal, had travelled to Punjab to pursue the case with BSF officers from the Western Command. Shaw is part of the BSF’s 182 Battalion, deployed along the international border in Punjab.The BSF’s Punjab Frontier is responsible for guarding the 553 km-long Indo-Pak border in the state, comprising 518 km of land and 33 km of riverine terrain. The region is manned by multiple BSF battalions, a water wing unit, artillery, and other force multipliers to prevent cross-border infiltration, smuggling, and narcotics trafficking.Shaw, who is a resident of Rishra in West Bengal’s Hooghly district, had inadvertently crossed the International Border while on duty along the Punjab border on April 23, a day after Pahalgam terror attack. He was immediately detained by Pakistani forces and remained in their custody amid heightened tensions between the two countries.Efforts to secure his release were initially taken up during flag meetings between Indian and Pakistani forces. However, the talks came to a halt just days before India launched retaliatory strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir following the Pahalgam terror attack. The escalation had left Shaw’s family in a state of deep anxiety, fearing that diplomatic efforts for his release would be derailed.Speaking to TOI last week, Shaw’s wife, Rajani Shaw, had pleaded with the Indian government to ensure her husband’s return. “The government should immediately discuss his release and repatriation to India during the talks with Pakistan,” she had said after the ceasefire was announced on Saturday.Rajani had travelled to Ferozpur with her young son and other family members to meet the commanding officer of Shaw’s unit. Though she was assured that talks were on, she was advised against visiting Delhi to seek help from the defence ministry. Just a day later, India launched strikes on terror camps.Throughout the conflict, Rajani said she had been monitoring news broadcasts in hope of a positive update. “Neither the BSF officers nor central government officials responded to our appeals,” she said, recounting her repeated attempts to reach BSF’s Ferozpur office.Local leaders, including Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee—who represents the Serampore parliamentary seat to which Rishra belongs—had also demanded immediate action. “We need to get him back immediately,” Banerjee posted on social media over the weekend.On Wednesday, hope turned into relief for Shaw’s family and hometown as he was finally brought back to Indian soil after 21 days in Pakistani custody.","BSF jawan Purnam Kumar Shaw was handed over to India on Wednesday morning.

We welcome the judgment,"" said Surendra Mohan.Defence counsel A Pandiarajan said there were no direct witnesses for the alleged offence.""We will appeal against the verdict in Madras high court,"" said Pandiarajan.The CBI invoked sections 120 (B), 342, 354, 354 (B), 366, 376 (D), and 376 (2) (n) of the IPC against all the nine accused.","Coimbatore mahila court judge R Nandhini Devi, concurring with the CBI prosecutor's submissions, read out the verdict convicting all the nine and sentencing a few of them to double life imprisonment.

"UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty steps down amid soaring costs, company withdraws 2025 forecast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/unitedhealth-group-ceo-andrew-witty-steps-down-amid-soaring-costs-company-withdraw-2025-forecast/articleshow/121144151.cms,"Andrew Witty (Photo-AP)

UnitedHealth Group announced Tuesday that CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down for personal reasons as the company grapples with unexpectedly high medical costs and withdraws its full-year financial outlook for 2025.Chairman Stephen Hemsley will return as CEO, effective immediately. Hemsley, who previously served in the role from 2006 to 2017, will continue as chairman of the company’s board. Witty, 60, will remain with the company as a senior adviser, as per news agency AP.UnitedHealth’s decision comes during a turbulent time for the healthcare giant, which has faced growing scrutiny and financial headwinds in recent months. In December, executive Brian Thompson was killed outside a New York City hotel. While the incident was not tied to the company’s financial operations, it sent shockwaves through the corporate world and was followed by a dramatic decline in UnitedHealth shares.“I’m deeply disappointed in and apologize for the performance setbacks we have encountered from both external and internal challenges,” Hemsley said during an early Tuesday conference call.“Many of the issues standing in the way of achieving our goals as well as our opportunities are largely within our control. I am optimistic about our future as these issues are within our capacity to resolve. We will approach them with humility, rigor and urgency. ”Witty joined UnitedHealth in 2018 after a nearly decade-long tenure as CEO of British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. He took over the helm of UnitedHealth in February 2021, succeeding Dave Wichmann.Under Witty’s leadership, UnitedHealth experienced significant growth. The company’s revenue soared to more than $400 billion last year, a 55% jump from the $257 billion it posted the year before he became CEO. Its stock price also surged during that period, rising 60.5%.However, the last several months have marked a period of considerable challenge. UnitedHealth cut its financial forecast last month following its first quarterly earnings miss in over a decade. On Tuesday, the company withdrew its full-year guidance entirely, citing higher-than-expected medical expenses tied to newly enrolled Medicare Advantage members.The backdrop of rising costs and public scrutiny has added to investor unease. The ongoing high-profile case surrounding Luigi Mangione, who was indicted last month on federal murder charges in the death of Thompson, has stirred national attention and contributed to a broader wave of criticism toward health insurers.Shares of UnitedHealth have fallen sharply—down 38% since Thompson’s killing on December 4—plunging more than 16% on Tuesday to their lowest levels in nearly five years.UnitedHealth Group Inc. serves more than 50 million Americans through its various health insurance offerings. In addition to its core insurance operations, it runs a major pharmacy benefit manager and its Optum division, which provides healthcare services and technical infrastructure.The company is also the nation’s largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, with over 8 million enrollees in privately run versions of the government health program for seniors.","UnitedHealth Group announced Tuesday that CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down for personal reasons.

Wall street rallies on cooling inflation; S&P 500 rebounds to erase 2025 losses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-wall-street-mixed-as-nasdaq-climbs-dow-slips-despite-cooling-inflations/articleshow/121142523.cms,"Most US stocks climbed on Tuesday following a promising inflation report that showed price pressures unexpectedly eased across the country in April, giving fresh momentum to a market already buoyed by optimism over US-China trade developments.The S&P 500 rose 0.8% in midday trading, building on Monday’s strong performance after the United States and China agreed to a 90-day pause in their tariff dispute to allow for further negotiations. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.6%, powered by strength in artificial intelligence and technology stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, down 152 points, or 0.4%, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern.The rally helped the S&P 500 erase its year-to-date losses, recovering nearly 20% from its recent lows and moving within 4.1% of its all-time high set in February. The index, a key component of many retirement portfolios, has rebounded amid expectations that the administration may ease tariffs to prevent a deeper economic slowdown and inflationary surge.Tuesday’s inflation data offered relief to markets. The consumer price index rose 2.3% in April compared to a year earlier, down from 2.4% in March. It was a welcome sign for investors worried about the toxic mix of high inflation and stagnant growth — a scenario economists call “stagflation.”“It’s encouraging because such data pulls the economy further from a worst-case scenario called ‘stagflation,’” the report noted. “The Federal Reserve has no good tools to fix the toxic combination. It could try to lower rates to help the economy, for example, but that would likely lead to worse inflation in the short term.”Despite the good news, analysts cautioned that the impact of ongoing tariffs could still push inflation higher in the months ahead, keeping the Federal Reserve in a wait-and-see mode.“It’s similar to the wait that investors in general are enduring,” said Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global cohead and co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “With the Fed set to make no moves on interest rates for the time being, markets will likely trade ‘with negotiation and reconciliation headlines.’”Louis Wong, director for Phillip Securities Group in Hong Kong, echoed the sentiment. “I think investors are aware that the trade deal is not done yet,” he said. “I would advise investors to remain cautious in the near term and to be prepared for unexpected news from the trade front.”On Wall Street , Coinbase Global surged 19.2% after it was announced that the cryptocurrency exchange will be added to the S&P 500 index next week, replacing Discover Financial Services, which is being acquired by Capital One Financial.AI stocks also led the charge. Nvidia gained 5.5%, acting as the largest contributor to the S&P 500’s advance. Super Micro Computer jumped 13%, GE Vernova added 5.6%, and Palantir Technologies climbed 7.3%.The strength in tech and AI helped offset a sharp drop in UnitedHealth Group shares, which plunged 16.1% after the insurer suspended its full-year forecast due to unexpectedly high medical costs. The company also announced that CEO Andrew Witty would step down for personal reasons, with Chairman Stephen Hemsley set to take over as CEO immediately.UnitedHealth's decline was the primary reason for the Dow's underperformance.In the bond market, Treasury yields rose slightly on optimism about the economy. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up to 4.48% from 4.45%, while the two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed policy, ticked up to 4.00% from 3.98%.Overseas, market performance was mixed. Tokyo’s Nikkei rose 1.4%, with automakers among the top gainers. Nissan Motor Co. added 3% ahead of plans to lay off 20,000 workers as part of its restructuring efforts.

US inflation softens to 2.3% in April despite tariffs; Economists caution on future price pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-softens-to-2-3-in-april-despite-tariffs-economists-caution-on-future-price-pressures/articleshow/121141873.cms,"US inflation eased for a third consecutive month in April, as falling grocery and gasoline prices offset early impacts from recently imposed tariffs. However, economists caution that price pressures may re-emerge in the coming months as the full effects of trade duties begin to filter through the economy.Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April from a year ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday, down from 2.4% in March and the smallest increase in more than four years. On a monthly basis, prices rose modestly, increasing 0.2% from March to April after falling 0.1% the previous month, the first drop in five years.Grocery prices fell 0.4%, pulled down in part by a big 12.7% drop in the price of eggs. It was the biggest decline in food costs at home since September 2020, the government said.Food prices at home declined 0.4%, with egg prices falling a sharp 12.7%, contributing to the largest single-month drop in grocery prices since September 2020. Energy prices also eased, helping moderate overall inflation.The data indicates that tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have yet to significantly influence consumer prices. Despite broad-based duties — including 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, a 10% universal tariff enacted on April 2, and previously announced 145% import taxes on Chinese goods (now reduced to 30%) — many product categories saw minimal price changes.Apparel prices declined 0.2%, new car prices remained unchanged, and furniture costs rose 1.5% over the month.“Firms have indicated... that they are unsure how much of the tariff cost increase they can pass through to consumers without denting demand, and we expect some testing of the waters and a staggered pattern of price increases,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, cofounder, Macro Policy Perspectives.Economists suggest that the full impact of tariffs may not be reflected immediately, as many businesses had already stockpiled inventory and some imports were in transit before the duties took effect.Meanwhile, core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased 2.8% annually, unchanged from March. On a monthly basis, core prices rose 0.3%, up from 0.1% the previous month — a potential signal of building underlying inflation.The White House announced Monday that it had reached a trade agreement with China, reducing tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China also lowered duties on US imports. The agreement includes a 90-day review window, after which 24% tariffs could return if further progress is not made.Despite the deal, the average US tariff remains historically high. The Yale Budget Lab estimates the current average is 18%, the highest since 1934. According to their analysis, tariffs at this level could lift prices by 1.7% and cost the average US household approximately $2,800 per year.Gasoline prices, meanwhile, averaged $3.14 per gallon, according to AAA, contradicting Trump's repeated claims that prices had fallen to $1.98 per gallon nationwide.“Tariffs is the most beautiful word,” Trump has said in support of the policy, suggesting duties will continue to play a central role in his economic strategy.While inflation is currently nearing the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, the combination of persistent tariffs, volatile global trade dynamics, and constrained consumer spending could complicate future monetary policy decisions.“The duties have raised the risk of both higher inflation and higher unemployment,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week. “Two challenges that rarely occur simultaneously.”In such a scenario, the Fed would be forced to balance its dual mandate. Lower interest rates might stimulate growth amid rising joblessness, while elevated inflation typically calls for tighter monetary policy — a contradiction that could restrict the Fed’s room to maneuver.Economists expect more pronounced tariff impacts in the second half of the year, depending on supply chain adjustments, consumer tolerance for higher prices, and further developments in international trade agreements.","Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April from a year ago, down from 2.4% in March and the smallest increase in more than four years.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

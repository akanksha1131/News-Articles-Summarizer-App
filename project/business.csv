Stock market today: Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , ended in red on Thursday as IT and telecom stocks faced selling pressure.

Investor sentiment remains cautious ahead of the Q1 results in anticipation of a muted start to the season from the IT and finance sectors. However, the recent consolidation in the IT stocks largely factors in the muted outlook, limiting further worries,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said.Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, Infosys, Bharat Electronics, Tech Mahindra and Eternal were the main decliners in the Sensex group.Maruti, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Trent and Tata Consultancy Services showed gains.""Dalal Street ended in the red on Thursday, as investors remained cautious ahead of two key events -- US President Donald Trump's upcoming tariff announcement and the start of India's Q1FY26 earnings season, with TCS scheduled to report results post market hours,"" Gaurav Garg, Analyst, Lemonn Markets Desk, said.The BSE midcap index decreased by 0.28 per cent whilst the smallcap index rose marginally by 0.12 per cent.In BSE sectoral indices, technology fell 1.17 per cent, telecommunication declined 1.11 per cent, BSE Focused IT dropped 0.77 per cent, IT decreased 0.71 per cent and consumer durables fell 0.44 per cent.Realty, metal, oil & gas and utilities sectors registered gains.""On the sectoral front, profit booking in IT majors ahead of TCS results weighed on the index, followed closely by weakness in FMCG and pharma stocks.

The broader indices also ended with modest losses, continuing their profit-taking phase,"" Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd, said.An Indian commerce ministry delegation will visit Washington soon for discussions on the proposed trade agreement with the US to resolve differences in sectors like agriculture and automobiles, according to a government official on Thursday.The visit is important as the US has extended additional import duties (26 per cent for India) until August 1.

Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Voltas, Samvardhana Motherson International Ltd, and JK Tyre & Industries Ltd. are the top buy calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for July 10, 2025:Nifty confined in less than half a percent range largely within its previous day’s range - ahead of its weekly expiry due today. With the index closing above its previous resistance of 25470 for 2 consecutive days indicates that the heatedness seen on the index is now out.Retest of bullish pole and flag pattern is also seen on hourly charts of Nifty as the index prepares its next move towards 26000+ with a support seen at 25250 odd. Any dips near the 25450-470 odd mark are likely to get bought into.Bank Nifty as well had an inside bar on daily charts after it closed above its past 3 days high on Tuesday. The index is once again giving confirmation on charts to head back to fresh all time highs. Bank Nifty has been outperforming Nifty from the start of this calendar year. 56900 is now likely to act as a fresh trailing support zone on the index.VOLTAS has ended at the highest point for the current fiscal despite media reports of A/c demand not growing as the markets continue to price in limited downside from current levels on the stock.Technically, the stock has broken out from its 3 month sideways consolidation and is now headed for a 8-10% rally.With MOTHERSON (Samvardhana Motherson International Ltd) giving a fresh crossover above its 200 DMA resistance, on daily charts the pattern suggests a bullish head and shoulder pattern formation along with a short term pole and flag pattern breakout already seen on the same. Momentum is likely to pick up above 160 on the stock.6 week long consolidation is now nearing an end on charts of JKTYRE (JK Tyre & Industries Ltd) as the stock has been on the verge of multiple breakouts. A bullish pole and flag pattern breakout is already confirmed on daily charts while a strong trendline breakout which has been in place for the past 18 months now is now being challenged due to the tailwind thrust by its ongoing breakout.Charts are likely to open up for a larger target once the stock sustains above 385, however for now we are eyeing for a 9-11% style rally from CMP.","Top stock market recommendations: According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Voltas, Samvardhana Motherson International Ltd, and JK Tyre & Industries Ltd are the top buy calls for today.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122354627,imgsize-80346,width-400,resizemode-4/122354627.jpg"

Gold and silver price prediction today: Gold rate is exhibiting a short-term bearish trend as its long-term story of being a safe haven remains intact. Where are gold and silver prices headed in the near-term and what levels should investors watch out for?Prices have broken the crucial ₹96,000 support zone, triggering a short-term bearish bias in MCX gold. With that cushion gone, technicals suggest immediate downside targets near ₹94,500 and possibly sliding lower toward ₹94,000 if momentum picks up.Several technical indicators reinforce this negative near-term outlook: gold is trading below its 10 and 21‑period EMAs, the RSI sits under 50, and MACD shows a widening bearish histogram—classic signs of a short-term downtrend . As long as ₹96,000 remains resistant, bears retain control.In markets over the medium-to-long term, gold fundamentals remain favourable. Easing Fed rate pressure, geopolitical uncertainty, and supportive macro trends are expected to propel prices higher over the longer horizon.The bias is negative in the short run—watch ₹94,500–₹94,000 as next support. But on longer timeframes, the positive structural story for gold remains intact.MCX Silver is currently trading near the upper limit of its short-term range—₹109,000—suggesting limited upward momentum and a negative bias.With prices testing resistance, a pullback toward the lower boundary of ₹104,000 appears likely. Once silver retraces to ₹104,000, the down‑leg would likely be complete—paving the way for the broader uptrend to resume.Technically, repeated resistance at ₹109k and rising supply near this zone point to consolidation in the ₹104,000–₹109,000 range. A dip to ₹104k would offer a strategic entry point, aligning with both range play and bullish longer‑term outlook.Expect silver to oscillate within ₹104,000–₹109,000 with a negative short‑term tilt. A pullback toward ₹104k should complete the current down‑leg, setting the stage for the next leg of the longer-term uptrend.","Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views.

Stock market recommendations:Indian equity benchmarks traded within a narrow consolidation band last week, reflecting subdued investor sentiment amid heightened uncertainty surrounding the India-US trade negotiations and the commencement of the Q1 FY26 earnings season. Market activity was largely stock-specific, driven by bottom-up themes, as participants remained cautious, awaiting concrete cues on both macro and micro fronts.Key point to highlight is that index over past 8 sessions has not even retraced 38.20% of preceding 10 sessions up move. Slower pace of retracement approaching indicates robust price structure that bodes well for the next leg of up move. The index is sustaining well above the recent consolidation breakout making higher base and staged a strong rebound indicating inherent strength.We anticipate the index to gradually trend higher and retest the 25,800 zone in the coming weeks, provided it continues to sustain above the crucial support band of 25,000–25,200. Key positional support is placed at 25,200–25,000, which coincides with the 20-day EMA, key retracement area and the upper edge of the prior consolidation zone (25,200–24,500).From a seasonality standpoint, July has historically been a favorable month for the Nifty, delivering positive returns 71% of the time since 1991, with an average gain of 2.5%.Structurally, the index has sustained its upward momentum over the past three months, demonstrating resilience amid a backdrop of geopolitical headwinds and evolving clarity on trade tariff dynamics. Notably, market internals have continued to strengthen during this period. Breadth indicators reflect a broadening of participation, with approximately 63% of Nifty 500 constituents now trading above their 200-day EMA—an improvement from 52% recorded last month—signaling improving market health and supporting the sustainability of the ongoing uptrend.Bank Nifty traded within a narrow consolidation band last week, reflecting subdued investor sentiment amid heightened uncertainty surrounding the India-US trade negotiations and the commencement of the Q1 FY26 earnings season.The index continues to trade above its 20-day EMA—a level it has consistently respected since April—signaling that the underlying bullish trend remains firmly intact. This, combined with improving market breadth, reinforces the higher high–higher low-price structure, suggesting a well-entrenched uptrend. The setup paves the way for a potential move towards the 58,500 zone in the upcoming quarter.On the downside, a strong support base is established at 55,500–56,000, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the 53,483–57,628 rally and aligns with the 50-day EMA. Any pullback towards this zone is likely to be viewed as a buying opportunity within the broader uptrend.Structurally, Bank Nifty is undergoing a phase-wise expansion, characterized by incremental price acceptance at higher levels. Rather than sharp directional spikes, the index is progressing through short consolidations, which are acting as springboards for subsequent upswings. This evolution from high-volatility moves to range-bound accumulation phases signals increasing market maturity. The tightening of correction ranges suggests supply is being absorbed by stronger hands, thereby maintaining trend continuity and enhancing the sustainability of the rally.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Equitas Small Finance Bank, and Medi Assist Healthcare Services are the top stock picks for today.

"TCS Q1 revenue falls 3%, 1st drop in over 4 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-q1-revenue-falls-3-1st-drop-in-over-4-years/articleshow/122375045.cms,"Bengaluru: TCS marked its first year-on-year decline in constant currency since the Sept quarter of FY21, with lacklustre performance attributed to weak macroeconomic conditions, cautious client sentiment, delayed decision-making, and the winding down of the BSNL deal. Its revenue for the June quarter fell 3.1% year-on-year in constant currency and 3.3% sequentially, as geopolitical uncertainties dampened demand.TCS CEO K Krithivasan said, ""The sequential degrowth was -3.3%. Of this, -0.5% is attributed to international revenue, while the remaining -2.8% is due to the BSNL deal winding down. From an outlook perspective, we remain confident and optimistic that international revenue in FY26 will surpass our FY25 revenue overall. It is too early to specify when growth will resume, as this largely depends on greater clarity emerging in the macroeconomic environment. However, with trade discussions nearing completion and the new bill in the US having received presidential approval, we expect things to become clearer by late July or early August.""Operating margin slipped slightly to 24.5% from 24.7% a year earlier. It, however, rose 30 basis points sequentially.""And the tailwinds came in from a reduction in third-party expenses,"" said its CFO Samir Seksaria. Its mainstay market, North America, saw a 2.2% year-on-year decline in constant currency, while India reported a sharp 21.7% drop, largely due to the ramp-down of the BSNL deal.. The UK revenue fell by 1.3%, and Continental Europe declined by 3.1%.Krithivasan said the international revenue declined by 0.5%, driven by several factors. One key issue was clients with approved projects were pausing or delaying them, as the expected return on investment (ROI) is no longer immediate. The threshold for ROI has risen, causing more projects to be put on hold. ""In some cases, decisions that we expected to be made within this quarter-so that transformation projects could start-have been delayed because clients are unclear about the return on investment for those projects. So, the overall reasons why projects are being delayed or paused remain very similar. However, as you can see, there was a minor-very small-growth in North America, while the UK and Europe experienced degrowth,"" he added.When asked about the reasons behind the bearish commentary and demand contraction, Krithivasan said that consumer industries are more impacted by tariffs.","Revenue for the June quarter fell 3.1% year-on-year in constant currency and 3.3% sequentially.

MUMBAI: Canara Bank on Thursday informed the Bombay HC that it has withdrawn an order that classified Anil Ambani 's loan account connected to Reliance Communications , which is undergoing insolvency proceedings, as 'fraudulent'.The HC bench then disposed of a petition filed by Ambani challenging the bank's Nov 8 order. The bank had classified the loan account as 'fraud' for reasons including that a Rs 1,050-crore-loan given in 2017 was routed through a company to pay other liabilities to related parties. On Feb 7, Ambani's advocate argued the order was communicated to him on Dec 25, after HC on Dec 20 stayed the bank's similar classification.","Anil Ambani's loan account connected to Reliance Communications is undergoing insolvency proceedings.

NEW DELHI: National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to bid out 124 highways and expressway projects worth Rs 3.4 lakh crore in current financial year (2025-26). NHAI has put the entire list of projects in public domain, amid a sense of uncertainty among the highway developers.In last two years, there has been a slowdown in award (bidding out) of projects by NHAI, after the halt of govt's flagship Bharatmala programme for highway development. While NHAI bid out projects of 6,003 km in 2022-23, this has slowed down to 3,339 km in 2023-24 and increased marginally to 4,008 km in 2024-25. Govt's decision to open bids only after 90% availability of land has been one of the reasons behind slowing down of projects.A senior NHAI official said the objective behind putting the list of the projects in public domain is to make the highway developers aware about them and prepare themselves. He accepted that slowdown in award of projects in past two years has been a matter of concern, which has created some sense of uncertainty among highway builders.This time, Nearly 78% of projects will be offered under public private partnership (PPP) mode, including development of 476 km of Gorakhpur-Kishangan-Siliguri highway, costing around Rs 35,000 crore, Patna-Purnea stretch (282 km) with estimated cost of Rs 17,076 crore and two packages of Nashik-Ahmednagar highway, with length of 374 km, entailing an investment of little over Rs 19,000 crore. Rest of the projects will be awarded under fully govt-funded mode.","National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to bid out 124 highways and expressway projects worth Rs 3.4 lakh crore in current financial year (2025-26) NHAI has put the entire list of projects in public domain, amid a sense of uncertainty among the highway developers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122374973,imgsize-957335,width-400,resizemode-4/122374973.jpg"

Rs 9 lakh crore liquidity glut prompts record Rs 2.5 lakh crore RBI drawdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rs-9-lakh-crore-liquidity-glut-prompts-record-rs-2-5-lakh-crore-rbi-drawdown/articleshow/122374891.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI will conduct a record Rs 2.5-lakh-crore variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auction on Friday as it seeks to absorb a persistent glut of liquidity in the banking system. This move follows a series of recent VRRR operations that have drained Rs 3 lakh crore, yet the money market surplus remains above Rs 3 lakh crore. By some estimates, the system is now awash with close to Rs 9 lakh crore in excess funds, drawing parallels with the quantitative easing seen in developed economies after the global financial crisis.This liquidity surge is the result of robust govt spending, including large fiscal outflows and subsidies, as well as RBI's foreign exchange interventions, which have added rupee liquidity. At the same time, deposit growth has outpaced credit growth, leaving banks with more cash than they can profitably deploy. Recent regulatory tweaks, such as changes to the liquidity coverage ratio, have further boosted banks' lendable resources.The VRRR auction is a key tool for RBI to mop up this surplus. Unlike the fixed-rate reverse repo, VRRR allows banks to bid competitively, helping to align overnight rates with the central bank's policy objectives and keep them within the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor","RBI will conduct a record Rs 2.5-lakh-crore variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auction on Friday.

Trade war: Canada reacts after Donald Trump slaps 35% tariffs; will US soften its stance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-war-canada-reacts-after-donald-trump-slaps-35-tariffs-will-us-soften-its-stance/articleshow/122378603.cms,"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday vowed to defend Canadian workers as the August 1 tariff deadline approaches. This response comes after US President Donald Trump announced a steep hike in duties on a broad range of Canadian imports to 35%, a move that deepens tensions between the two longtime allies.Sharing a post on X, Carney said, ""Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses. We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1.""He also highlighted Canada's efforts in tackling the fentanyl crisis, a key issue raised by the Trump administration to justify new tariffs.""Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries,"" he said.""We are building Canada strong. The federal government, provinces and territories are making significant progress in building one Canadian economy. We are poised to build a series of major new projects in the national interest. We are strengthening our trading partnerships throughout the world,"" he added.In a letter to Carney, Trump said the 35% tariff hike builds on the 25% duties imposed in March, and will take effect from August 1. The US claims the move is meant to pressure Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling, despite Canada's limited role in the drug's trafficking.""Starting August 1, 2025, we will charge Canada a tariff of 35% on Canadian products sent into the United States, separate from all sectoral tariffs. As you will recall, the United States imposed Tariffs on Canada to deal with our Nation’s Fentanyl crisis, which is caused, in part, by Canada’s failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our Country. Instead of working with the United States, Canada retaliated with its own Tariffs,"" Trump said in his letter on his Truth Social.Trump also warned against retaliatory measures from Ottawa, saying any additional tariffs imposed by Canada would be matched and added on top of the existing 35%. However, he offered an olive branch of sorts, urging Canadian companies to relocate production to the US.""As you are aware, there will be no Tariff if Canada, or companies within your Country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally, and routinely — In other words, in a matter of weeks. If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 35% that we charge,"" he added.Although Trump sent similar tariff letters to multiple countries this week, Canada, the US's second-largest trading partner after Mexico, has become a particular target.Ottawa has pushed back with retaliatory tariffs and rejected Trump’s provocative remarks about making Canada the ""51st state.""While Mexico has also been hit with 25% tariffs over fentanyl, it has not received the same level of public criticism from Trump.Carney, who was elected prime minister in April on a platform of defending Canadian interests, has since moved to reduce Canada's dependence on the US by strengthening ties with Europe and the UK.Just hours before Trump's letter was released, Carney posted a photo with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on X, writing, ""In the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.""","US President Donald Trump announced a steep hike in duties on a broad range of Canadian imports to 35%.

NEW DELHI: Further talks on the India-US trade deal are lined up in the coming days with negotiators once again headed to Washington as the government seeks to finalise an agreement, without any deadline pressure.""We are not differentiating between an interim or the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement. We are negotiating a complete deal. Whatever will be finalised, we can package it as an interim deal, and for the rest, talks will continue,"" said an official, days after President Donald Trump announced that US was ""close to making a deal with India"".Earlier this year, Trump and PM Modi had set a deadline for finalising a trade deal by September-October but with reciprocal tariffs announced, an interim tranche or a mini deal entered the picture. While Trump has been sending letters to countries setting revised reciprocal tariffs effective Aug 1, India is so far not on the list.But month-end is seen as the latest deadline to offer concessions in areas of interest to the US. In India's case, it is agriculture that is of prime interest, along with American whiskey and automobiles, but the government is reluctant to lower tariffs on farm goods. Besides, commerce minister Piyush Goyal has said that the government will not be bound by deadlines and will ensure that India's interest remains paramount.On Monday, Rajesh Agarwal, India’s chief negotiator for the US trade deal, said the government is trying to negotiate and finalise a trade agreement.Having implemented 14 free trade agreements with 26 countries, he said, “Now, we are integrating with major markets also... we just concluded an agreement with the UK, we are in an advanced stage of negotiations with the European Union, we are trying to negotiate and finalise a deal with the US...”“This will create huge opportunities for India also to become part of global value chains,” he said here at an event on export logistics. Agarwal also listed New Zealand, Chile and Peru among countries with which talks were under way.“Our tariffs will be bilaterally cut... People will be able to make long-term investment decisions based on this predictability of tariff and regulatory landscape... In this logistics will also be a major determinant,” he had said. Besides, he had underlined that the government was working towards lowering logistics costs.","Talks on the India-US trade deal are lined up in the coming days.

Housing squeeze: 30-year US mortgage rate rises to 6.72%; 5-week easing streak ends as borrowing costs inch up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/housing-squeeze-30-year-us-mortgage-rate-rises-to-6-72-5-week-easing-streak-ends-as-borrowing-costs-inch-up/articleshow/122371064.cms,"T he average long-term mortgage rate in the US edged higher this week, ending a five-week streak of easing borrowing costs that had offered some relief to prospective homebuyers.According to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year home loan ticked up to 6.72% from 6.67% last week. A year ago, the rate was higher at 6.89%, AP reported.The increase also extended to 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, often used for refinancing. The average rose to 5.86% from 5.80% a week earlier, compared to 6.17% at this time last year, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.Persistently high borrowing costs have continued to weigh on the housing market, which has been in a sales slump since 2022. “Mortgage rates may come down modestly over the coming months,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, “but other economic headwinds — including the impact of tariffs on consumer goods, weaker labour market conditions and rising consumer debt — could be what continue to hold the housing market in the second half of 2025. ”Despite the recent dip in rates, home prices remain elevated, which has discouraged many buyers.Sales of previously occupied homes last year fell to their lowest in nearly three decades and have remained subdued so far in 2025.Mortgage rates are primarily influenced by movements in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use to price home loans. The yield rose to 4.37% by midday Thursday, up from 4.34% a day earlier. Yields climbed last week after a stronger-than-expected jobs report led traders to bet that the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates on hold.The 30-year mortgage rate has hovered near its 2025 peak of just over 7%, set in January. It briefly dipped to a low of 6.62% in April.Recent easing in rates helped drive a 9.4% jump in mortgage applications last week, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. But economists broadly expect rates to remain in the 6% to 7% range for the rest of the year.","The average rate on a 30-year home loan ticked up to 6.72% from 6.67% last week.

The timing and the circumstances have drawn scrutiny, especially as the electric vehicle maker faces a 27% stock slide this year, driven in part by CEO Elon Musk ’s growing alignment with President Donald Trump and intensifying competition in the EV market.“The annual meeting provides shareholders with the opportunity to hear directly from the board about these concerns, and to vote for or against directors, the board’s approach to executive compensation, and other matters of material importance,” said a letter to the board signed by more than 20 Tesla shareholders. The letter was sent just days before the compliance window closed.The annual gathering is expected to be a turbulent affair, with many investors reportedly unsettled by Musk’s dual focus on politics and side ventures.The meeting could serve as a flashpoint for debate over his leadership and the board’s governance record.On the same day the meeting was announced, Musk also said his AI chatbot Grok would soon be integrated into Tesla vehicles. “Grok is coming to Tesla vehicles very soon. Next week at the latest,” Musk wrote on social media platform X.Grok, developed by Musk’s AI startup xAI, is positioned as a politically unfiltered alternative to other chatbots such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, the rollout has been marred by controversy. On Wednesday, xAI confirmed it was taking down “inappropriate posts” made by Grok that reportedly included antisemitic messages praising Adolf Hitler.Tesla shares briefly rebounded 3% at the opening bell on Thursday, after sharp declines earlier in the week when Musk’s feud with Trump again captured headlines.","Tesla has scheduled its annual shareholder meeting for November 6.

These figures offer another sign of strength in the country’s labour market even as major companies announce job cuts and concerns grow over the economic impact of tariffs.According to data released by the US labour department on Thursday, initial applications for unemployment aid fell by 5,000 to 227,000 in the week ending July 5, below the 238,000 predicted by analysts, AP reported.Jobless claims are closely watched as an indicator of layoffs.This follows last week’s report showing that US employers added a stronger-than-expected 147,000 jobs in June. The national unemployment rate edged down to 4.1%, improving slightly from May’s 4.2% figure. Many analysts had anticipated a rise to 4.3%, but the labour market once again showed unexpected resilience, despite growing uncertainty over US president Donald Trump’s economic policies.Still, signs of strain are emerging. The ongoing uncertainty over Trump’s policies, particularly his use of aggressive tariffs, is causing unease among businesses. Most economists argue that such tariffs reduce competition and make the economy less efficient.They also risk triggering retaliatory measures from other countries, which could hurt US exporters and prompt businesses to halt hiring or reduce their workforce.Unless fresh trade agreements are reached, the bulk of Trump's proposed tariffs, now extended until 1 August, could weigh further on economic momentum and rekindle inflationary pressures, economists warn.A number of major firms have already announced job reductions this year. Microsoft revealed last week it will cut around 9,000 jobs, marking its second large-scale layoff in recent months and the biggest in over two years. Google, meanwhile, confirmed fresh buyouts in June as part of its continued cost-cutting efforts.Other companies trimming their workforce include Meta (Facebook’s parent company), Procter & Gamble, Starbucks, CNN, Workday, Dow, and Southwest Airlines.While short-term volatility in claims is common, the four-week moving average, considered a more reliable measure, also fell by 5,750 to 235,500.However, the number of Americans continuing to receive unemployment benefits rose by 10,000 to 1.97 million for the week ending June 28, the highest figure since November 2021.","Initial applications for unemployment aid fell by 5,000 to 227,000 in the week ending July 5, below the 238,000 predicted by analysts.

Truth Social post

Tariff seen as key revenue source for US government:

US President Donald Trump announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports starting August 1 promising it will help America build a strong copper industry again and enter a “golden age.”In his truth social post, Trump said, ""I am announcing a 50% TARIFF on Copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust NATIONAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT.""Then, pointing to significance of copper he added, ""Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many. Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) “Leaders” decimate this important Industry?""Trump blamed past American leaders for weakening the country’s copper industry, calling them “foolish” and “sleepy.” He said the new tariff would fix what he called the former US President Joe Biden administration’s “stupidity” and help America build a strong copper industry again.“This 50% tariff will reverse the Biden Administration’s thoughtless behaviour and stupidity.” Trump wrote. He promised the move would make America a dominant copper producer once again and it is necessary to protect national security.Trump’s plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper is part of a broader strategy to increase government revenue through tariffs. According to AFP report, Trump told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday: “Today we’re doing copper.I believe the tariff on copper, we’re going to make it 50 percent.”The move adds to existing tariffs the US has placed on imports of steel, aluminum and vehicles. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration has already collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue so far, with hopes of reaching $300 billion by December.Earlier, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the new copper tariff would likely be implemented in late July or on August 1.","US President Donald Trump announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports starting August 1.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

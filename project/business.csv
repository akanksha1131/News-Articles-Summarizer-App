Stock market recommendations:In recent weeks, the Nifty index has showcased remarkable resilience, maintaining its upward trajectory and investor confidence despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Escalating tensions in key global regions, which typically heighten market volatility, have not deterred the index's momentum. Additionally, the recent spike in crude oil prices—a factor that historically weighs heavily on the Indian economy due to its import dependence—has had a surprisingly muted impact on market sentiment. This strength in the face of adversity reflects underlying market optimism, robust domestic fundamentals, and continued participation from both institutional and retail investors.The Nifty has delivered a technically significant breakout, moving above the last 6 weeks’ range 25,200-24,500, closing decisively above the 25,200 marks. In Thursday's session it closed above 25,500 levels, its highest closing level in over eight months. This move not only reinforces the prevailing bullish momentum but also validates the sustained higher high–higher low-price structure, a classic hallmark of a well-established uptrend.Importantly, the positive market breadth—reflected in broad-based participation across sectors—adds conviction to the ongoing rally.Given this strength, we are revising our near-term upside target for the index to the 25,700–25,900 zone. This revised projection aligns with the measured move objective derived from the recent consolidation range between 24,500 and 25,200. The breakout from this congestion zone suggests a continuation pattern, and with technical indicators supporting the trend, we anticipate these levels to be achieved over the coming weeks.We are upwardly revising the immediate support base for the Nifty to the 24,800–25,000 zone. This zone now emerges as a critical demand area, as it coincides with the current week’s swing low and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), thereby forming a strong confluence support region.Sustained price action above this zone will reinforce the bullish bias and provide a launchpad for further upside. This area is expected to act as a key pivot in the near term, where any potential pullbacks could find buying interest. A hold above this support band will be instrumental in maintaining the current trend structure and confirming the strength of the ongoing breakout.Bank Nifty staged a strong uptrend last week, culminating in a fresh all-time high during Thursday’s session, driven in part by improved global risk sentiment following reports of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This breakout underscores the index's robust bullish undertone, further validated by its sustained position above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) since April—a key indicator of persistent upward momentum.From a structural standpoint, the index continues to exhibit a classic higher-high, higher-low formation, reflecting a well-established uptrend. The breadth of the rally remains healthy, with participation expanding across key banking constituents, thereby reinforcing the directional strength. Notably, Bank Nifty is displaying characteristics of trend elongation, where extended rallies are followed by shallow and orderly retracements—a technical sign of a strong and maturing trend.Given the recent breakout from the consolidation zone of 56,000–53,500, the implied pattern target projects an upside potential towards the 58,500 mark over the coming weeks. This projection is further supported by bullish price structure and momentum indicators.On the downside, the key support base has been recalibrated to the 55,000–55,500 region, which marks a confluence of technical factors—namely, the 50-day EMA and the recent swing lows of the past three weeks. This zone is likely to act as a strong accumulation area, and any corrective pullbacks into this region should be viewed as incremental buying opportunities within the broader uptrend.The stock has generated a breakout above the falling channel containing last 1 month’s corrective decline signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is currently seen rebounding after a base formation around the 50 days EMA signaling overall positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 176 levels in the coming months being the 80% retracement of the entire previous decline (184-123).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a bullish cup and handle formation and is seen sustaining above the short- and medium-term moving averages thus supporting the positive bias.The breakout is supported by strong volume and the base of recent consolidation is placed at the 200 days EMA which supports the positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 319 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline (395-201).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Tata Steel, and Lloyds Engineering Works are the top stock picks for today.

Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East. With the US declaring a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, the safe haven demand for gold has somewhat gone down. What’s the outlook for gold and silver prices in the near future and what gold and silver rate levels should investors look at? Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views:Gold is currently holding a crucial support level around ₹95,800. This zone is significant, as a strong reversal from here could potentially trigger a recovery in prices, targeting the ₹98,500 mark. This level also coincides with a previously unfilled gap, making it a key technical target for traders watching for a bounce.Despite a recent 4% correction in gold prices, the broader trend remains positive. The pullback is being viewed as a healthy retracement within a larger bullish structure, and market sentiment continues to favor the upside, especially amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global demand for safe-haven assets.A sustained move above ₹98,500 would be a strong bullish signal, clearing the way for a possible retest of the psychological ₹100,000 mark. Momentum traders may closely watch for confirmation above this resistance level to enter fresh long positions. On the downside, if ₹95,800 fails to hold, it could invite further selling pressure, but for now, the support remains intact. Overall, the bias remains positive, with technical indicators pointing to a potential recovery, provided key levels are respected. Investors are advised to stay alert for price action cues around the ₹95,800–₹98,500 range.MCX Silver has recently witnessed a sharp decline of around 5% from its recent highs, triggering short-term concerns among traders. However, despite this pullback, the broader trend for silver remains firmly positive. The recent correction appears to be a temporary pause within an ongoing bullish trajectory, rather than a reversal of the larger trend.The ₹102,500 level is emerging as a crucial support zone, and price action near this area will be key in determining the next move. This level has historically provided a base for reversals, and a strong bounce from here could reignite bullish momentum. Technical indicators suggest that as long as this support holds, the upside potential remains intact.On the higher side, silver prices have the potential to reclaim the ₹109,000 level, which represents a significant resistance zone and a near-term target for buyers. A sustained move above this resistance could pave the way for further gains in the medium term.Overall, while short-term volatility may persist, the underlying strength in silver remains. Traders and investors should closely monitor the ₹102,500 support for signs of reversal, as it could offer a favorable risk-reward entry point for the next leg higher.","Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East.

'Unthinkable Trade Barriers Must Go'- Donald Trump Warns India Ahead of US Trade Deal Deadline

Remittance Tax Relief

US Biggest Source Of Remittances For India

US remittance tax relief on the cards! Non-Resident Indians or NRIs have reason to breathe a sigh of relief as the final draft of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ proposes just 1% tax on remittances, as against 3.5% earlier.Originally, the bill sought a 5% remittance tax but the final House version lowered it to 3.5%. However, the US Senate draft has lowered it further.The introduction of the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' had initially created anxiety amongst the US-based Indian community regarding its potential effects on money transfers to India.The United States hosts approximately 2.9 million Indians as of 2023, making them the second-largest foreign-born population, according to the Migration Policy Institute.The tax imposed shall apply only to any remittance transfer for which the sender provides cash, a money order, a cashier’s check, or any other similar physical instrument.Also Read | ‘Like H-1B without a lottery’: What is O-1 visa? New route to US becomes popular among Indians; check details The updated US Senate draft released yesterday also provides exemptions for transfers from bank accounts and other financial institutions, whilst also excluding transactions made through US-issued debit and credit cards, according to an ET report.Consequently, routine remittance transactions are likely to be exempt from this new taxation structure. According to the Senate's proposal, the remittance tax will only be implemented on qualifying transfers conducted after December 31, 2025.International remittances serve as a vital economic lifeline, particularly for developing economies. Countries such as India derive significant benefits from these overseas transfers, with numerous rural communities relying heavily on such foreign income.According to RBI's latest survey in March, the United States contributed approximately $32 billion, representing 28 per cent of India's total remittance receipts of $118.7 billion in 2023-24.The Reserve Bank's March study highlighted an increasing trend of qualified professionals moving to developed countries, with the United States accounting for 27.7% of remittances.

India will continue its robust economic growth trajectory and outpace major industrialised G7 countries, supported by strong domestic demand, sound macroeconomic fundamentals and a favourable demographic profile, the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) said in a report.The report, titled, highlights that with an average real GDP growth of over 8% from 2021 to 2024, India has consistently outperformed all G7 countries—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Citing IMF projections, the industry body said India is expected to maintain a growth rate above 6% on average through 2029. “India’s consistent real GDP growth makes it the key growth driver for the world economy,” said Hemant Jain, President, PHDCCI, according to ANI.He credited India’s momentum to structural reforms such as GST, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, and expanding digital infrastructure like Aadhaar and UPI.In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), India’s share in global GDP has risen from 7% in 2020 to 8.3% in 2024 and is expected to exceed 9% by 2029.A key driver, is India’s demographic edge—with over 68% of its population in the 15–64 age group—compared to ageing G7 populations where over 10% are above 65. By 2030, this share is expected to double in many G7 countries, leading to shrinking labour pools and increasing dependency burdens, ANI reported.India’s merchandise trade with G7 nations has grown 61%, from $154 billion in FY21 to $248 billion in FY25, while maintaining a steady trade surplus. “This reflects India’s rising export competitiveness,” the report said. It also noted India’s global leadership on initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, Mission LiFE, and the Global Biofuels Alliance.In technology and digital governance, the report said India’s approach to AI, with initiatives like BHASHINI and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), showcases a human-centric and ethical model. PHDCCI said strategic cooperation with G7 on clean energy, climate finance, supply chain resilience, and healthcare will define future growth trajectories.","India will continue its robust economic growth trajectory and outpace major industrialised G7 countries.

ICRA projects continued volume growth of 6-7% for FY26, driven by housing and infrastructure demand. Improved operating margins are expected due to price hikes and favorable cost environment, with lower coal and steady diesel prices.

India’s cement industry registered a 9% year-on-year growth in volume in May 2025, reaching 39.6 million metric tonnes (MT), while average cement prices rose 8% to Rs 360 per 50-kg bag, according to a report by rating agency ICRA.The report noted that cement prices in the first two months of FY26 averaged Rs 360 per bag, up 7% over the same period last year. This comes after a 7% decline in FY25, where average prices had fallen to Rs 340 per bag.Volume growth also remained steady.

According to GfK data, Panasonic’s market share stood at just 1.8% for washing machines and 0.8% for refrigerators, with six consecutive years of sales losses reported in both categories.“This is in line with our global strategy and evolving market dynamics,” a Panasonic Life Solutions India spokesperson said in a statement, quoted PTI.“We will focus on HVAC – commercial and residential – and televisions in the Panasonic Consumer Business category, and discontinue washing machines and refrigerators.” The company will support dealers in liquidating existing inventory and will continue to offer full customer service including parts and warranty coverage, the spokesperson added.The decision follows a broader directive by Panasonic Group CEO Yuki Kusumi, who in May announced plans to exit unprofitable businesses globally in order to break stagnation and drive future growth, PTI reported.For its India operations, Panasonic will continue to invest in key verticals such as home automation, electricals, energy solutions, and B2B technologies. Its consumer electronics portfolio—spanning air conditioners, televisions, kitchen appliances, beauty products, and Lumix cameras—will remain intact, the company clarified.“In our journey towards long-term sustainable growth, we acknowledge that the evolving business model has led to certain roles being restructured,” the spokesperson said. “This is a difficult but necessary step, and we deeply appreciate the contributions of our impacted employees.”Panasonic India reported revenue of around Rs 11,500 crore in FY25, posting double-digit growth overall.","Panasonic India reported revenue of around Rs 11,500 crore in FY25, posting double-digit growth overall.

"Agroforestry push: Centre issues model rules to ease tree felling on farmland, boost legal timber trade",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/agroforestry-push-centre-issues-model-rules-to-ease-tree-felling-on-farmland-boost-legal-timber-trade/articleshow/122131700.cms,"In a step to promote agroforestry and streamline tree felling norms on agricultural lands, the Centre has notified a new set of model rules aimed at easing procedural hurdles for farmers, increasing tree cover outside forests, and supporting India’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement.In a letter dated June 19 to all state governments, the environment ministry said the ‘Model Rules for Felling of Trees in Agricultural Lands’ are designed to simplify tree-felling permissions, improve traceability, and enable farmers to integrate trees into farming systems without complex red tape, PTI reported.The initiative, the ministry said, supports India’s broader efforts to double farmer incomes, reduce timber imports, and build sustainable land-use models. A key challenge so far has been the absence of harmonised rules across states—creating bottlenecks in tree cultivation and marketing of agroforestry products.Under the new framework, the State Level Committee (SLC)—earlier constituted under the Wood-Based Industries (Establishment and Regulation) Guidelines, 2016—will also oversee the agroforestry framework. The committee will now include officials from revenue and agriculture departments, and will empanel agencies for on-ground verification of plantations and timber transit.Farmers will be required to register their land on the National Timber Management System (NTMS) portal, entering details such as land ownership, plantation data (species, sapling count, planting date), and tree height.For plots with over 10 trees, applicants must file online with detailed tree information. Verifying agencies will inspect the land, submit a report, and based on the data, a felling permit will be generated. In cases involving 10 or fewer trees, uploading photographs of the trees and later the stumps will suffice, with the system estimating yield and species using AI tools. Officers may verify these as needed, but no objection certificates (NOCs) will be auto-generated via NTMS, according to PTI.Divisional forest officers will monitor verifying agencies and submit quarterly reports on their performance to the SLC.Currently, states follow their own regulations regarding tree felling on farmland. Some exempt specific species from permissions, while others require felling clearance even on private land depending on the location and tree type.The NTMS system aims to solve a core issue for farmers—lack of recognised proof that the timber is legally harvested. This often results in lower prices and barriers to market access, especially from wood-based industries and exporters wary of sourcing from unverified supply chains.By offering a digital trail of compliance, the NTMS is expected to unlock better prices for farmers, especially in the context of the EU Deforestation Regulation, which mandates that timber imports into the EU must not be linked to deforestation after 2020.The ministry said the new framework will make agroforestry more structured, transparent, and remunerative, helping build a legal and export-ready ecosystem for Indian timber.","The Centre has notified a new set of model rules aimed at easing procedural hurdles for farmers, increasing tree cover outside forests. The initiative, the ministry said, supports India’s broader efforts to double farmer incomes, reduce timber imports, and build sustainable land-use models.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122131758,imgsize-1476782,width-400,resizemode-4/122131758.jpg"
Slice Reimagines Credit Access with UPI-Linked Card,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/slice-reimagines-credit-access-with-upi-linked-card/articleshow/122131164.cms,"Mumbai: Slice has launched the slice UPI credit card, aiming to integrate formal credit seamlessly into India’s dominant UPI payment system. Designed to work like any UPI transaction, the card eliminates the need for physical swipes or cards, offering features like cashback and interest-free EMIs.However, Slice’s broader ambition lies in reimagining India’s credit infrastructure, not just introducing a new card. Following its merger with North East Small Finance Bank, Slice now operates as a full-fledged bank with complete control over its technology stack, including core banking systems and credit underwriting. The bank on Saturday, opened its first digital-led branch in Bengaluru with the first of its kind UPI ATM. The new ATMs enable withdrawals and deposits using a QR code, eliminating the need for a physical card or account number. Users can scan a QR code at the machine to withdraw cash from any bank account or make deposits, even without entering account details. Slice intends to deploy hundreds of these ATMs across the country in the coming years to ensure broad access.Rajan Bajaj, founder and executive director of Slice, said the bank’s goal is to reshape India’s credit landscape by extending access to 130 million credit-worthy but underserved citizens.“The traditional credit card model was largely unchanged for 75 years since its inception in America. This needs to be redesigned for India to be able to service 300 million of our citizens who are credit worthy.” He emphasized the role of mobile in this transformation: “The interface of serving this credit is mobile. But the fundamental source of the money still remains credit.” Slice’s experience with new-to-credit customers gives it an edge, with Bajaj noting, “50% of those customers being new to credit… who really understand the credit risk of these customers where small ticket sizes are relevant.”Bajaj added that Slice’s credit model has “performed 30% better historically than the market,” making it ideal for reaching underserved segments at scale. He pointed out how UPI simplifies credit disbursement by enabling approval “at the point of transaction,” removing the need for physical credit cards: “The physical one just can be a physical like virtual card.” According to him, most co-branded cards focus on the same group of 40–50 million users, whereas Slice aims to go beyond: “For the 300 million credit-worthy individuals in India, access to a credit card would be a game changer for them. ” Bajaj sees this shift as transformative, comparing it to UPI’s rise over the past decade: “We think UPI credit card is that same moment for India… ten years from today it'll be like one of the biggest moments of UPI unlocking credit for the entire economy.”A key differentiator is Slice’s ability to underwrite customers who were previously excluded. Bajaj claimed their Customer Acquisition Costs are “10 times lower than traditional banks,” thanks to a mobile-first approach and strong word-of-mouth. This enables Slice to offer credit to a much broader customer base and across more merchants: “60, 70 million merchants” versus “5, 6 million merchants” in the traditional credit card system. The average transaction size is expected to fall from ₹2,500 to smaller amounts, making it “more relevant for this large 300 million population of India that's credit worthy.”Transparency is also central to Slice’s offering. Bajaj emphasized the need to give users control over repayments: “People can control the way they are paying… if they want to roll over, this is the extra interest that they'll end up paying.” The card includes a “flagship 3 months free installment” feature, allowing users to convert purchases into equal payments: “Instead of 90 days one shot, you are getting 1667 rupees for three months… in this cycle, next month cycle and then the next next month cycle. ”Beyond credit cards, Slice is expanding its banking model. While continuing with loans like personal and SME credit, it is focusing on scalable digital products. Bajaj sees Slice’s future as rooted in financial inclusion. With half of its customer base being new to credit, the bank is focused on serving “130–140 million Indians who are not even eligible for formal credit today.”","Slice has launched the slice UPI credit card, aiming to integrate formal credit seamlessly into India’s dominant UPI payment system.

The Ministry of Power on Saturday announced the formation of a task force to develop the India Energy Stack (IES)—a unified digital public infrastructure aimed at transforming India’s power sector with secure, standardised, and interoperable systems.Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the IES will be instrumental in integrating renewable energy, boosting DISCOM efficiency, and ensuring transparent, future-ready power services, PTI quoted.“There is an urgent need for developing robust DPI in the power sector to manage the country’s rising demand, ensure grid stability, and empower consumers. What Aadhaar did for identity and UPI achieved for digital payments, the India Energy Stack will accomplish for the power sector—unlocking seamless, secure, and consumer-centric energy services for every citizen,” he said in an official statement.The ministry said the IES is part of its broader strategy to address the sector’s fragmented digital systems as India moves towards a $5 trillion economy and net-zero targets. The IES will offer unique IDs for consumers, assets, and transactions; enable real-time, consent-based data sharing; and support open APIs for system integration, innovation, and market access, the agency reported.To operationalise this vision, a 12-month proof-of-concept (PoC) will be rolled out to pilot real-world use cases in collaboration with selected utilities. This includes the Utility Intelligence Platform (UIP)—an analytics-driven, modular tool based on IES—meant to help utilities, policymakers, and consumers with real-time insights and smarter energy management.A dedicated task force comprising experts from the technology, power, and regulatory domains has been constituted to guide development, pilot implementation, and national scale-up of the stack.","The India Energy Stack is a unified digital public infrastructure aimed at transforming India’s power sector.

Sources said this amount clears the country's ""admitted"" dues till March 31, though ""claimed"" dues by Adani remain about $500 million—provided Bangladesh completes its June-end payment commitment, PTI reported.The payments come amid Dhaka's ongoing struggle to meet obligations under the 25-year power supply pact signed during the tenure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The agreement had come under strain after rising import bills—exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war—and a severe dollar crunch triggered by months of political turmoil that led to Hasina's ouster in August 2024.In response to mounting unpaid bills, Adani Power halved electricity supply to Bangladesh in November 2024. Full supply from its 1,600 MW Godda plant in Jharkhand resumed in March 2025 after Bangladesh resumed monthly payments.With the latest tranche, Bangladesh has paid nearly $1.5 billion of the total $2 billion billed so far. Adani has reportedly agreed to waive late payment surcharges for January to June 2025, amounting to $20 million, contingent on timely future payments.However, differences remain between Adani’s “claimed” and Bangladesh’s “admitted” dues—primarily due to disagreements over coal costs and plant capacity calculations. A spokesperson for Adani Power confirmed the June payments but declined to comment on outstanding disputes, calling the discussions private.The 2017 deal has faced renewed scrutiny under Bangladesh's interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. The administration has initiated a review of several power purchase agreements, including Adani’s, through a committee comprising energy and legal experts.Adani’s contract involves supplying the entire output from its coal-based Godda plant to Bangladesh. Following payment defaults, Adani had reduced supply by half in late 2024 but resumed full exports after partial liability clearance, the report said.Bangladesh’s financial crunch, driven by reduced forex reserves and growing import bills for energy, had resulted in widespread power outages last year. The country has since been repaying monthly dues and recently sought an additional $3 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), atop an earlier $4.7 billion bailout package.Adani Power is among several Indian firms selling electricity to Bangladesh. Others include state-run NTPC and PTC India Ltd. The interim government has labelled several Hasina-era power deals “opaque” and is in the process of evaluating their long-term financial and legal implications.","Bangladesh has paid $384 million to Adani Power this month, significantly reducing its outstanding dues under a 2017 power supply agreement.

Rise of Zohran Mamdani

Wall Street worried

The possible victory of Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, in the upcoming New York mayoral polls has people on Wall Street worried.In Manhattan's financial district, pessimistic predictions are circulating. According to Wall Street recruitment specialist Michael Nelson, his clientele, typically earning above $1 million annually, express serious concerns.""This will be the end of New York City as we know it"" reflects the sentiment amongst his affluent clients regarding Mamdani's potential November victory, he told Bloomberg.The impact is already visible in New York City property-related stocks. Flagstar Financial Inc., which provides loans to apartment complexes, experienced up to 6.7% decline on Wednesday. Property companies Empire State Realty Trust, SL Green Realty and Vornado Realty Trust also registered losses.Even critics acknowledge that Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, has garnered significant public support.""It's officially hot commie summer,"" wrote hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb on X, following Mamdani's unexpected victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.Also Read | Days of South Asians being ignored and erased in New York politics are gone, says Zohran Kwame Mamdani The statement reflects the genuine concern amongst the city's wealthy circles that a Mamdani victory in the November general election would result in increased taxation, potentially causing affluent residents to leave the five boroughs.An important detail is that Mamdani’s tax proposals would require approval from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul, who has expressed opposition. Additionally, Mamdani's plan to raise $70 billion in debt faces significant obstacles.According to Kathy Wylde, a prominent New York intermediary who has facilitated connections between business leaders from finance, real estate and media with city officials for years, whilst Mamdani appeals to the youth, his ideological stance causes significant concern among taxpayers and employers.However, Mamdani successfully gained support from voters across diverse socioeconomic and racial communities.In his Wednesday morning address, he emphasised that ""a life of dignity should not be reserved for a fortunate few.""The foundation of his success lay in a strategic social media campaign that combined populist economic policies and progressive cultural messaging through viral-worthy video content.On Tuesday, he featured in an Instagram video alongside Emily Ratajkowski, who commands over 29 million followers. The model and actress sported a ""Hot Girls for Zohran"" t-shirt whilst encouraging voter turnout.This exemplified the clever strategy that enabled Mamdani to build a substantial volunteer base numbering in tens of thousands. These supporters diligently canvassed neighbourhoods, maintained street presence and utilised social media to reach voters. They promoted his policy agenda: Free childcare, state-operated grocery shops with reduced prices, complimentary bus transport, rent controls and additional measures - largely funded through increased taxation of wealthy individuals.New York's establishment elite supported Cuomo, a 67-year-old Democratic veteran who positioned himself as an experienced centrist capable of addressing the city's challenges, from underground transit safety to the widely recognised cost-of-living issues.His campaign received substantial financial backing from prominent figures, including Michael R. Bloomberg, founder and primary owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, along with Bill Ackman, Loeb and Vornado's Steven Roth. His political action committee, Fix the City, accumulated an unprecedented primary campaign fund of nearly $25 million.However, the campaign's advertising strategy predominantly focused on criticising Mamdani rather than highlighting Cuomo's administrative plans. Despite resigning as New York governor following sexual harassment claims, which he contests, Cuomo maintained strong establishment support, including an endorsement from former President Bill Clinton.In contrast, Mamdani received endorsements from progressive leaders, including Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders.Some financial sector representatives appear to be considering a more accepting stance towards the democratic socialist candidate.""While we might disagree on certain issues, we should always be hopeful that Mamdani — if he ends up being elected mayor — can unite the city to address its critical education, public safety, housing and economic development needs,"" said Ralph Schlosstein, former head of Evercore Inc. and a longtime Democrat, according to the Bloomberg report.According to Rich Farley, an experienced Wall Street legal expert, numerous affluent residents view the November general election as crucial. A Mamdani victory could prompt wealthy individuals to seriously consider relocating from the city.Before this contest, high-net-worth donors must determine their stance towards Mamdani. Cuomo, potentially running as an independent, needs to convince supporters of his viability outside the Democratic primary framework.Should he continue his campaign, he will face Republican Curtis Sliwa and incumbent Eric Adams, who is running independently after avoiding the primary following corruption allegations.Some Wall Street professionals are contemplating more decisive actions.""I've already talked to hedge fund guys who have told me they have got a foot out the door,"" said Eric Rosen, who previously held senior positions at JPMorgan and in hedge fund management.""I left New York City 8 years ago because I didn't like the way the city was being run,"" he said. ""I sold my Park Ave. co-op and its now down 25% and my house in Florida is up 250%. The market has spoken.""","Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, won the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.

Starlink India: What’s next?

Security watch, spectrum talks shape Starlink’s rollout

Elon Musk-owned Starlink is poised to receive its final regulatory approval to launch satellite communication services in India, with space regulator IN-SPACe issuing a draft authorisation document for the company to sign. Once completed, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre will countersign the document, effectively clearing the way for Starlink to begin operations.The development will place Starlink on par with existing satcom players Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite, both of whom have already secured similar approvals. Starlink received its Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence last month, becoming the third company in India permitted to offer satellite-based communication services, reported ET.Despite receiving the GMPCS licence and being close to final authorisation, Starlink must still fulfil critical operational and security requirements before launching commercial services in India. The company is now required to set up ground infrastructure, including satellite earth stations, communication gateways, and a control and monitoring centre within Indian territory.Following the installation of these systems, Starlink will have to demonstrate service functionality for security clearance, a mandatory step for all satcom operators.Without this security nod, companies are not permitted to commercially roll out services, even if they hold all necessary licences.Rivals OneWeb and Jio Satellite, which received their GMPCS permits in 2021 and 2022 respectively, are still awaiting security approval. Both companies were allocated trial spectrum by the department of telecommunications (DoT) last year to test their systems and demonstrate compliance. This trial allocation has now been extended by six months.Starlink’s progress will be closely watched by Indian security agencies, especially in light of earlier concerns. Authorities previously raised alarms over the unauthorised use of Starlink terminals in sensitive regions like the Northeast. The ministry of home affairs flagged the issue to the DoT in March this year, leading to increased scrutiny of the company’s operations and data-sharing practices.Under India’s satcom regulations, all traffic must be monitored within the country, pass through Indian gateways, and comply with local control protocols. Companies are also required to create buffer zones along international borders as part of the operational mandate.The DoT is expected to soon allocate a trial spectrum to Starlink to allow for demonstrations of its services and security compliance.India is simultaneously working on streamlining its satellite spectrum allocation policy. The telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) has recommended that satcom spectrum be assigned administratively for five years. The proposed fee is set at 4% of a provider’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR).For urban users, an additional charge of Rs 500 per subscriber annually is expected, while no such cost will be levied for rural users. Notably, there will be no upfront fee or allocation cost for satellite spectrum under these recommendations.In a sign of the government’s growing interest in satellite connectivity, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia recently met top SpaceX officials to discuss opportunities to use satellite technologies for expanding India’s digital infrastructure","Elon Musk-owned Starlink is poised to receive its final regulatory approval to launch satellite communication services in India.

US retirement age hits 67 by 2026: Early retirees to lose up to 30% in benefits- what it means for social security income,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-retirement-age-hits-67-by-2026-early-retirees-to-lose-up-to-30-in-benefits-what-it-means-for-social-security-income/articleshow/122126781.cms,"Representative image

Why the retirement age is increasing



T he full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security benefits in the United States will increase to 67 starting in 2026, affecting millions of Americans planning their retirement. Those opting to retire early at age 62 could see up to a 30 per cent reduction in monthly benefits.The change stems from reforms signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan in 1983 to address long-term financial challenges facing the Social Security system. The original Social Security Act, introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935, initially set the retirement age at 65.The FRA has been rising gradually since 1991, increasing by two months per year. It reached 66 in 1996 and will reach 67 in 2026 for individuals turning 65 that year and beyond.When the social security act was created, life expectancy in the US was just 61. By 1983, it had risen to over 74, and today it stands at 79. At the same time, the number of workers supporting each retiree has dropped, from 8.6 in 1955 to 2.8 in 2013, placing greater pressure on the system.The 1983 amendment was designed to address these demographic shifts and extend the program’s solvency.Many Americans claim benefits at age 62 due to financial need, health issues, or concerns about future cuts. However, doing so results in permanently reduced monthly payments. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), claiming benefits at 62 can result in up to a 30 per cent decrease, while delaying retirement until age 70 can significantly increase monthly payouts.A recent report from the Social Security Board of Trustees warns that the Social Security Trust Funds will have enough revenue to pay full benefits only until 2034. After that, without Congressional action, only 81 per cent of scheduled benefits would be payable. This could reduce the average monthly cheque from $1,976 to about $1,600.In 2024, trust fund reserves fell by $67 billion to $2.72 trillion, as program costs continued to exceed income.

"Liquidity surplus alone doesn’t boost broad credit growth, economic activity holds greater influence: StanChart report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/liquidity-surplus-alone-doesnt-boost-broad-credit-growth-economic-activity-holds-greater-influence-stanchart-report/articleshow/122126052.cms,"Standard Chartered Bank (Image credits: IANS)

Credit growth in the economy is influenced more by overall economic activity than by the size of the liquidity surplus, according to a recent report by international bank Standard Chartered.The report said that while a high liquidity surplus may support growth in unsecured personal loans (excluding consumer durable loans), it does not necessarily lead to broad-based credit expansion.""Credit growth depends more on economic activity than the size of the liquidity surplus; however, unsecured personal loan growth (ex-consumer durables) could get a fillip on a large liquidity surplus,"" reported ANI quoting the report.It noted that credit growth, excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans, tends to slow down during times of excess liquidity. This points to real credit demand, which is closely tied to economic activity, being a stronger driver than the availability or cost of funds.The central banks often respond to slowing economic activity by increasing liquidity as a counter-cyclical measure. However, even with such efforts, overall credit (excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans) as a share of GDP has historically declined during times of high liquidity surplus.Citing one example, the report said that between December 2016 and September 2017, when liquidity surplus ranged between 2.6% and 3.3% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), credit (excluding unsecured personal and consumer durable loans) as a share of GDP fell from 48.9% to 46.2%. This downward trend continued until mid-2019.In contrast, unsecured personal loans (excluding consumer durables) have shown a strong upward trend over the past decade, with their share in GDP more than doubling to around 6%. This growth is driven by structural factors such as greater credit access and the rise of digital lending. However, the pace of expansion in this segment tends to pick up during periods of high liquidity.For instance, during March 2021 to March 2023, when liquidity conditions were relaxed, the share of unsecured personal loans in GDP rose faster than in previous similar periods, the report highlighted.","Credit growth depends more on economic activity than the size of the liquidity surplus. Unsecured personal loan growth (ex-consumer durables) could get a fillip on a large liquidity surplus, says Standard Chartered.

The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation focuses on reproductive health.

The Sherwood Foundation supports Nebraska-based nonprofits and early childhood education.

The Howard G Buffett Foundation works to address global hunger, human trafficking, and conflict resolution.

The NoVo Foundation advocates for marginalised girls, women and indigenous communities.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett donated $6 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock on Friday to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family-run charities. This marks his largest annual donation since he began giving away his fortune in 2006.The donation included about 12.36 million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway. Of that, 9.43 million shares went to the Gates Foundation, while 9,43,384 shares were donated to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. Three other foundations, led by Buffett’s children Howard, Susie, and Peter, each received 660,366 shares. These are the Howard G Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation, and the NoVo Foundation.With this latest donation, Buffett’s total charitable giving has now exceeded $60 billion. Despite the large gift, he still owns 13.8% of Berkshire’s stock, as per Reuters.Before Friday’s donation, Buffett’s net worth was estimated at $152 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. Following the donation, he is expected to rank sixth. This gift surpasses the $5.3 billion he gave away in June last year, and the $1.14 billion he donated to family charities in November.In a statement, Buffett reaffirmed that he does not plan to sell any Berkshire shares. Now 94, he has led Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway since 1965. The $1.05 trillion company owns nearly 200 businesses, including Geico and BNSF Railway, as well as large stakes in Apple and American Express.Last year, Buffett revised his will to leave 99.5% of his remaining fortune to a charitable trust after his death. The trust will be overseen by his three children, who will have about ten years to distribute the funds, and must decide together how the money is allocated. Buffett has previously said that donations to the Gates Foundation will stop after his death.","Warren Buffett donated $6 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock on Friday to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family-run charities.

Industrial profits in China fell sharply in May, reversing a brief recovery and highlighting growing challenges in the world’s second-largest economy. The decline reflects a slowdown in factory activity, mounting deflationary pressures, and persistent instability in trade relations with the United States.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday, quoted by Reuters, industrial profits dropped 9.1 per cent year-on-year in May, ending two consecutive months of growth. The slide comes amid weak domestic demand and continued stress in the property sector.NBS statistician Yu Weining attributed the contraction to ""insufficient effective demand, declining prices of industrial products and fluctuations in short-term factors.""In the first five months of 2025, industrial profits fell 1.1 per cent from a year earlier, following a 1.4 per cent rise recorded in the January-April period. The downturn coincides with the steepest factory-gate deflation China has experienced in nearly two years, as well as continued declines in consumer prices.Despite isolated signs of resilience, such as an unexpected uptick in retail sales in April, economists suggest more policy support is needed to strengthen what remains a fragile recovery.ANZ senior China strategist Xing Zhaopeng noted that commodity tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump have affected prices, while fierce domestic price competition has compressed manufacturers’ margins.The automotive sector, in particular, has come under strain. Sustained high US tariffs and aggressive pricing strategies have led Chinese authorities to intervene, urging manufacturers to halt price wars. Automotive dealers have complained about excessive inventory pressure, stating that manufacturers are oversupplying dealerships, which is eroding profitability and forcing some outlets to shut down.Feng Jianlin, chief economist at Beijing FOST Economic Consulting, said, ""The impact of overcapacity and falling prices on enterprises is still emerging, and efforts need to be made to adjust supply and stabilise demand.""A sectoral breakdown of the data revealed that state-owned enterprises saw profits decline by 7.4 per cent in the January-May period, while private sector firms posted a slight increase of 0.3 per cent. Foreign enterprises registered profit growth of 3.4 per cent.","Industrial profits in China fell sharply in May, reversing a brief recovery.

Crude oil price to slump?

Oil prices were on track for their biggest weekly decline since March 2023, as fears of supply disruptions from the Iran-Israel conflict faded, erasing any risk-driven premiums.As of 0637 GMT on Friday, Brent crude futures were up 36 cents, or 0.53 per cent, at $68.09 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 33 cents, or 0.51 per cent, to $65.57. Despite the modest intraday gains, both benchmarks were poised for a weekly drop of around 12 per cent, according to Reuters.Prices have now fallen back to levels seen before the escalation began on June 13, when Israel launched missiles at Iranian military and nuclear facilities. At the start of the week, prices had surged to a five-month high following US strikes on Iranian nuclear installations. However, markets reversed course after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, leading to a steep drop on Tuesday.Analysts noted the lack of a meaningful disruption to oil flows from the geopolitical tensions. ""Absent the threat of significant supply disruption, we still view oil as fundamentally oversupplied, with our 2025 balances indicating a roughly 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) surplus,"" Macquarie analysts said in a research note quoted by Reuters.The firm revised its WTI price forecast upward by $2, now expecting an average of $67 per barrel in 2025 and $60 in 2026, factoring in lingering geopolitical risks.Some support for prices emerged from US government data, which showed a decline in crude and fuel stockpiles last week, alongside a rise in refining activity and demand. ""The market is starting to digest the fact that crude oil inventories are very tight all of a sudden,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at the Price Futures Group.Additional bullish sentiment followed a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that President Trump is considering an early nomination for the next Federal Reserve chair. The move has revived expectations of potential interest rate cuts in the US, which could bolster oil demand.","Brent crude futures were up 36 cents, or 0.53 per cent, at $68.09 per barrel.

US-China Trade Deal

US-China trade deal: Soon after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal, China has also confirmed that details have been finalized. China also said that United States will 'cancel a series of restrictive measures'.Earlier in the day, Trump said that the United States and China have reached a trade agreement. He also indicated an anticipated deal with India.According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's interview with Bloomberg TV, the agreement was finalized earlier this week, though specific details were not disclosed.""We just signed with China the other day,"" Trump said. Lutnick confirmed the agreement was ""signed and sealed"" two days prior.This development follows initial discussions in Geneva in early May, where both nations agreed to delay substantial tariff increases that threatened bilateral trade.

We're going to have deal after deal,"" Lutnick said, according to an AP report.China disclosed earlier this week an acceleration in rare earth export approvals, crucial materials for high-technology products including electric vehicles. Beijing's export restrictions on rare earths have been a significant point of dispute.The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced Thursday that Beijing was expediting the review process for rare earth export licence applications and had approved several applications that met requirements.Export restrictions on minerals overshadowed tariffs during recent trade talks between Beijing and Washington, following China's implementation of licensing requirements for seven rare earth elements in April. This action potentially threatened to affect production of vehicles, robotics, wind turbines and advanced technological items in the United States and globally.The Geneva accord reached in May required both nations to reduce retaliatory tariff increases implemented during Trump's trade war escalation. However, certain elevated tariffs persist, including Washington's duties related to fentanyl trade and those on aluminium and steel.Also Read | Indian team in US for fresh talks on trade deal These dynamic policy changes are negatively impacting both leading global economies.The US economy declined at a 0.5 per cent annual rate from January through March, partially due to increased imports as businesses and consumers acquired foreign products before Trump's potential tariff implementation.Chinese manufacturing profits decreased by more than 9 per cent year-over-year in May, with automotive manufacturers experiencing significant losses. The January-May period showed a decline exceeding 1 per cent compared to the previous year.Trump and US officials expressed optimism about securing trade agreements with numerous countries, including India.""We're going to have deal after deal after deal,"" Lutnick said.","US President Donald Trump said that the United States and China have reached a trade agreement.

Chinese tech giant Xiaomi stunned the electric vehicle (EV) market on Thursday night after it received an overwhelming response to the launch of its new electric SUV, the YU7, clocking 289,000 pre-orders within the first hour of sales.The flood of demand sent the company’s Hong Kong-listed shares soaring to a record high, reinforcing Xiaomi's rapid rise in China's competitive EV sector.According to news agency AFP, Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun expressed astonishment at the unprecedented customer interest. “My goodness, in just two minutes, we received 196,000 paid pre-orders and 128,000 lock-in orders,” Lei said in a video following the launch.“We may be witnessing a miracle in China's automotive industry.”The YU7, a five-seater electric SUV, starts at 253,500 yuan (around $35,360), pricing it nearly 4% below Tesla’s Model Y in China. The sharp price point and Xiaomi’s aggressive feature set appear to have fueled the rapid pre-sale demand.The vehicle boasts a range of up to 760 kilometres on a single charge, significantly above the 719 kilometres advertised for Tesla’s extended-range Model Y.Reuters reported that the YU7's early orders surpassed market expectations of 100,000 and were more than triple the initial response to Xiaomi’s debut sedan, the SU7, launched last year. Analysts at Jefferies noted that while the YU7 is “slightly below” Tesla’s Model Y in price, it “offers much better specs and performance.”Citi analysts, as cited by Reuters, warned that Tesla may need to offer more incentives or even cut prices to keep pace with Xiaomi’s momentum.The YU7 also includes high-end tech features like Apple CarPlay, Apple Music support, and AI-enhanced driver-assist capabilities powered by Nvidia’s Thor chip. Despite being behind Tesla in full self-driving technology, Lei Jun claimed the YU7 beats the Model Y “on a range of metrics.”As per CNBC, the launch was originally planned for July but was moved up, possibly to capitalise on strong market momentum and an intensifying EV price war in China. The vehicle will begin deliveries within one to five weeks.Beyond cars, Xiaomi also launched AI-enabled smart glasses that can take photos, scan QR codes for payments, and perform real-time translations, positioning the brand against Meta’s Ray-Ban smart offerings. Priced at 1,999 yuan ($279), the glasses are currently available only in China.The launch comes at a critical time for China’s economy. Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin this week, highlighted EVs as a cornerstone of Beijing’s push to become a “major consumption powerhouse.” The Xiaomi launch aligns with that strategy, helping drive demand for high-value, tech-forward products.Following the overwhelming reception, Xiaomi’s stock jumped 8% in early trade before paring gains to end 3% higher.According to Reuters, its market capitalisation has now surpassed $200 billion, making it the best-performing large-cap stock in the Asia-Pacific region this year.","Xiaomi's new electric SUV, the YU7, received 289,000 pre-orders within the first hour of sales.

Tesla shake-up: Who is Omead Afshar? Senior executive reportedly fired by Elon Musk amid slumping sales in key markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-shake-up-who-is-omead-afshar-senior-executive-reportedly-fired-by-elon-musk-amid-slumping-sales-in-key-markets/articleshow/122103380.cms,"File photo: Omead Afshar (left) and Elon Musk (Picture credit: X, ANI)

Who is Omead Afshar?

Omead Afshar, one of Elon Musk ’s closest aides and Tesla’s vice president of manufacturing and operations, has been reportedlyfired by Musk as the electric vehicle maker grapples with declining sales across North America and Europe.According to CNBC, Afshar’s termination comes just days before the end of the second quarter, amid ongoing pressure from investors following Tesla’s fifth consecutive monthly sales drop in Europe and a 15% decline in deliveries in China.Afshar’s dismissal marks the latest high-profile exit from Tesla following the recent departure of Milan Kovac, head of the company’s Optimus humanoid robotics program.Afshar had been leading a critical team overseeing Tesla’s business across major markets, including executives in sales and policy.His ouster comes at a time when Tesla’s brand has also taken a reputational hit, partly due to Musk’s controversial political positions and the underperformance of the Cybertruck. Analysts are forecasting a global drop of at least 10% in Tesla’s Q2 deliveries. The stock is down 19% this year.Often described as “Musk’s fixer,” Afshar was one of the most powerful and trusted executives within Elon Musk’s business empire.According to Forbes, he began his journey with Tesla as an engineer in 2011 and rose through the ranks to eventually become vice president, overseeing operations in North America and Europe.An American citizen born to Iranian parents, Afshar studied biomedical engineering with a focus on mechanical engineering at the University of California, Irvine.Known for his perfectionism and operational discipline, Afshar gained Musk’s trust early on and became involved in some of Tesla’s most high-stakes projects.He played a key role in building Tesla’s massive Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, a project that solidified his reputation for delivering under pressure.In 2022, he was the subject of an internal probe over the acquisition of rare construction materials, including speciality glass, for a secretive Musk-led initiative, as reported by Bloomberg.Following that investigation, he worked briefly at SpaceX, where he was later promoted to vice president before returning to Tesla.Afshar also had a hand in Musk’s 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now known as X. According to ET, he helped implement cost-cutting measures during the platform’s restructuring.Despite his abrupt firing, Afshar continued praising Musk on social media in recent days, calling the robotaxi pilot launch in Austin “absolutely historic” and thanking the CEO “for pushing us all.”His influence was such that The Wall Street Journal once described him as one of the few insiders who could both understand and execute Musk’s most ambitious visions.","Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, has been reportedly fired by Elon Musk.

Asian equities surged to multi-year highs on Friday, mirroring Wall Street’s optimism, as easing geopolitical concerns and expectations of interest rate cuts lifted investor sentiment across the region.Meanwhile, oil prices posted modest gains but remained on track for a significant weekly decline amid easing Middle East supply risks and growing optimism over US-Iran diplomacy.According to news agency Reuters, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its highest level since November 2021 and was last up 0.2%, set to end the week nearly 3% higher.Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5%, crossing the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months, supported by improved sentiment and robust earnings.The rally was buoyed by several positive developments, including a breakthrough between Washington and Beijing on rare earth shipments and news that the US may scrap a controversial tax proposal, a move that had earlier worried foreign investors.Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ, was quoted by Reuters as saying that the reversal ""allays one of the concerns from foreign investors.""European markets also reflected the upbeat tone, with futures on the EUROSTOXX 50 and Germany’s DAX up 0.6%, while FTSE futures climbed 0.16%.The optimism comes amid growing speculation that the US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates soon.As per Bloomberg, a sharp drop in the US dollar has helped lift Asian currencies and fuel demand for regional assets. The Bloomberg Dollar Index is set for its sixth consecutive monthly decline, its worst losing streak since 2017.With Trump reportedly considering a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by October, concerns about the Fed’s independence have further weakened the greenback.Investor appetite in Asia has also been driven by blockbuster fundraising activity, with IPO volumes across Hong Kong and Tokyo rising sharply. Regional companies have raised over $90 billion through share sales this year, a 25% increase from the same period in 2024.In commodities, oil prices rose slightly on Friday but remained poised for their steepest weekly decline in over a year. Brent crude gained 0.41% to $68.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate rose 0.46% to $65.53, Reuters reported.Despite the modest rise, both benchmarks were down more than 10% this week, reversing gains from the initial surge following the Israel-Iran conflict.According to the US Energy Information Administration, crude inventories dropped by 5.8 million barrels in the week to June 20, far exceeding expectations, as summer driving demand increased.Still, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has eased fears of major disruptions, limiting further gains.As per Bloomberg, markets are now shifting their attention to upcoming trade decisions in Washington and a crucial OPEC+ meeting on July 6, where production policy for August will be determined.Reuters quoted Phil Flynn of the Price Futures Group as saying, “The market is starting to digest the fact that crude oil inventories are very tight all of a sudden,” adding that a weaker dollar is also supporting prices.Despite lingering uncertainties around US trade tariffs and Iran’s future oil exports, the market’s focus has returned to fundamentals. Citi analysts noted that Trump’s swift ceasefire push “suggests he remains sensitive to high oil prices,” potentially capping geopolitical risk premiums.With investor optimism returning and central banks signalling support, Asia’s equity and credit markets appear well-positioned, though analysts warn the road ahead may still hold “a few more twists,” especially with upcoming trade deadlines.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its highest level since November 2021.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

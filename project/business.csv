Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in opening trade on Monday following global cues. While Nifty50 went below 24,900, BSE Sensex was down over 800 points. At 9:58 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,855.85, down 257 points or 1.02%. BSE Sensex was at 81,568.05, down 840 points or 1.02%.The escalating Israel-Iran conflict and US involvement are expected to influence market performance on Monday. Market analysts indicate that global factors will be crucial, as investors monitor US manufacturing and services PMI data, alongside geopolitical developments. The market outlook suggests consolidation with expected volatility.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Even though the US bombing of Iran’s three nuclear facilities has worsened the crisis in West Asia, the impact on the market is likely to be limited. The uncertain factor now is the timing and nature of the Iranian response. If Iran targets and damage the US defence facilities in the region or hurts US military personnel seriously, the US response can be huge and this might further worsen the crisis.But the market assessment is that there are limits to what Iran can do against US and Israel. That’s why the early market responses - crude prices, US futures, absence of panic in Asian markets - have been muted.”“Even though the possibility of the closure of Hormuz Strait is a threat, it is important to understand that this has always been only a threat and the Strait had never been closed. The fact is that the closure of Hormuz Strait will harm Iran and Iran’s friend China more than anyone else. The market construct continues to favour a ‘buy on dips’ strategy.""Early Monday trading in Asia showed declining US stock-index futures and rising oil prices following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. Asian stocks showed weakness.Gold prices increased slightly on Monday as investors sought safe-haven assets amidst growing concerns about Middle East tensions, with markets awaiting Iran's reaction to US strikes on its nuclear installations.Oil prices surged on Monday, reaching their peak since January, following America's decision to support Israel in targeting Iranian nuclear installations, raising concerns about supply disruptions.Foreign portfolio investors purchased shares worth Rs 7,940 crore net on Friday, whilst domestic institutional investors recorded net sales of Rs 3,040 crore.Foreign institutional investors reduced their net short positions in the futures market from Rs 96,962 crore on Thursday to Rs 96,368 crore on Friday.","While Nifty50 went below 24,900, BSE Sensex was down over 800 points.

ITR Filing Deadline Extended: Why It Happened And What To Do Now? | Income Tax Return | Explained

ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: Which Form For Gig Workers?

Importantly, ITR-1 and ITR-2 do not apply to income from freelancing or gig work. Selecting the correct form is crucial for smooth return processing and to avoid errors or compliance notices.

Freelancers maintaining books of accounts and claiming actual business expenses should file ITR-3 .

. Alternatively, those in specified professions—such as legal, accounting, or technical consultancy etc—with gross receipts up to Rs 50 lakh (or Rs 75 lakh if cash receipts do not exceed 5% of the total gross receipts) may opt for ITR-4 under the presumptive taxation scheme. Under the presumptive taxation scheme, 50% of gross receipts are deemed taxable, simplifying compliance by eliminating the need for detailed bookkeeping.

Income Tax Return (ITR) e-filing FY 2024-25: ITR filing may be relatively straightforward for salaried individuals, but what about gig workers and those who earn through freelancing? With the rise of freelance and gig-based income, many individuals are unsure how to report such earnings correctly.The ITR filing for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) has been partially thrown open on the Income Tax Portal incometax.gov.in. Individuals who have to file their tax returns using ITR-1 or ITR-4 forms can now do so. So which ITR form should gig workers and free lancers use to file their ITR for FY 2024-25?As non-traditional work arrangements grow, understanding the appropriate tax filing requirements is essential for freelancers and gig workers to remain compliant and minimize potential issues.According to Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India, income from independent work—such as writing, design, consulting, tuition, or platform-based gigs like ride-sharing and food delivery—is treated as “Profits and Gains from Business or Profession” under Indian tax law.Amarpal Chadha tells TOI that ITR-4 cannot be filed if the taxpayer has incomes like short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains u/s 112A exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh, income from and reporting of foreign assets, etc.Also Read | Income Tax Return: Are capital gains from MFs taxed differently under new & old regime?

Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:

Gold Price Outlook

From a technical standpoint, the current setup favors a ""Sell on Rise"" strategy around the ₹99,000–₹99,150 levels. Here's why:

Conclusion:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have shown a weak trend in the past few days. Where are gold rates headed in the near-term and what should investors of gold do?Gold prices opened with a significant gap-down in the June 20 session, reflecting prevailing weakness in COMEX Gold, and continue to trade with a bearish tone in domestic markets. The MCX Gold August Futures contract (05AUG2025) is currently quoting near ₹98,722 after touching an intraday low of ₹98,705, indicating persistent selling pressure at higher levels.1. EMA Resistance Levels: The 8-period EMA is currently placed at ₹99,150, and the 21-period EMA is at ₹99,350. Prices are trading well below both averages, signaling a clear short-term downtrend. Any intraday pullback toward these levels is likely to attract fresh selling.2. Bollinger Bands: The price action is hugging the lower Bollinger Band, a typical sign of trend continuation in strong bearish momentum. There’s no indication of mean reversion yet, which suggests that rallies may be limited and short-lived.3. Pivot Points: The previous day’s pivot level near ₹99,200–₹99,350 now acts as a key resistance zone.Failure to reclaim this zone reinforces the bearish outlook.4. RSI (14): The Relative Strength Index is hovering near 32.75, which is close to the oversold region but not yet showing signs of bullish divergence. This supports the argument for further weakness before any meaningful reversal.5. MACD: The MACD indicator is strongly negative with the MACD line at -34.71 and the histogram indicating increasing bearish momentum. The signal line remains far below zero, indicating a continuation of the downward trend.6. Price Action & Gap Analysis: Today’s gap-down open confirms a breakdown from the range-bound structure observed between June 17–19. This price gap indicates strong selling interest, likely due to pressure in international gold prices and a firmer dollar index.Traders are advised to follow a Sell on Rise approach as long as prices remain below the ₹99,150–₹99,350 resistance zone. The immediate downside targets lie near ₹98,300 and further lower toward ₹98,000 if the bearish sentiment intensifies. A stop loss can be considered above ₹99,500 to protect against unexpected short-covering rallies.","Gold prices opened with a significant gap-down in the June 20 session, reflecting prevailing weakness in COMEX Gold.

Stock market recommendations:Larsen & Toubro’s business mix has shifted, led by strong international order growth, with FY25 inflows up 2x & core EPC revenue up 1.7x vs. FY22. Saudi leads the global pipeline, with Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, and CIS as emerging growth regions. LT expects strong domestic orders from T&D, defence, & buildings & factories.A healthy order pipeline (up 57% YoY for FY26) should drive mid-teens EPC revenue growth over 5yrs. RoE rose from 11% to 16.3% (FY22–25), led by efficient working capital and focus on returns.LT is diversifying revenue, focusing on new growth areas like renewables, hi-tech manufacturing (defence, space), data centres, and international EPC projects.

Despite 6.5x revenue growth over FY19-25, Trent’s share remains in low-single digits, which augurs well for the company.We remain positive on Trent for its robust footprint additions, strong double-digit growth, long runway for growth in Star (presence in just 10 cities) and emerging categories like beauty and lab-grown diamonds. We expect FY25–27E CAGR of ~25–26% in standalone revenue, EBITDA, and PAT, driven by the continuation of robust area additions in Zudio.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting June 23, 2025) are Larsen & Toubro, and Trent.

Gold price prediction today: Gold is in focus with heightened geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel and with the US bombing nuclear facilities in Iran. Will gold prices resume a conclusive upward trend amidst growing global uncertainties?Gold prices remained volatile throughout last week, hovering around the ₹1 lakh mark domestically, as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, boosting safe-haven demand.Despite this, gold’s upward momentum was capped by a firm dollar, which was hovering slightly below 100. Investors are closely monitoring the US Federal Reserve’s policy stance after it left interest rates unchanged while signalling a more gradual rate cut path ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized caution, citing stable unemployment and expectations of rising inflation due to tariffs. Markets are pricing in rate cuts totalling 50 bps in 2025, but less aggressive easing for 2026–27.Meanwhile, US data revealed weaker-than-expected retail sales and industrial production, indicating potential economic softness, though jobless claims were lower, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Market participants now await Powell’s upcoming testimony and key economic indicators including preliminary PMIs, GDP, consumer confidence, and the PCE price index.In global developments, China’s central bank held steady on its loan prime rates, adding pressure to industrial metals. Domestically, silver saw some profit booking from all-time highs. Despite tensions and US intervention in the Iran-Israel conflict, Iran' s stance on Strait of Hormus is very important for further direction in the market.","Gold prices remained volatile throughout last week, hovering around the ₹1 lakh mark domestically. geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, boosting safe-haven demand.

Sources acknowledged that the talks have hit a hurdle.In the absence of a limited deal ahead of the July 9 deadline, domestic industry will have to brace for a 26% levy, especially with a view within the govt that what the Trump administration is offering in the form of a 10% baseline tariff, applicable to all countries, is not good enough.At the start of the negotiations, the govt was hoping to get zero duty access for several products of India's interests, including textiles, leather goods, pharmaceuticals as well as some engineering goods and auto parts.American negotiators, who are keen that the deal be finalised, have indicated to their Indian counterparts that the Trump administration cannot go down to zero tariffs immediately. In any case, India has sought immunity from future tariff actions once a deal is in place.Unhappiness in India over US President Donald Trump's claim - since rejected by PM Narendra Modi - of having brokered the pause in Operation Sindoor, has also not helped in creating a conducive atmosphere for resolution of trade-related issues.","The proposed trade deal with the US has run into rough weather with Indian authorities resisting the insistence of their counterparts.

""The companies include Midwest Advanced Materials, Entellus Industries, and public sector Indian Rare Earths (IREL),"" sources have told TOI.The sources said that heavy industries secretary Kamran Rizvi has also taken presentations from companies as govt develops strategies for indigenous capabilities in magnet production.""Midwest Advanced Materials made a presentation about their plans to produce rare earth magnets in India with a capacity of 500 tonnes per annum.

""The industry members requested govt to support companies in setting up magnet production by providing incentives and monetary benefits,"" the source said.Secretary Rizvi told the companies to make ""realistic statements about magnet production"" as potential customers in the auto sector will suffer due to incorrect assessments. The auto industry has also requested potential local producers to provide a firm timeline on supplies, if possible, emphasising that their production line depends on quick procurement.The situation for the auto industry has deteriorated over the past few months as no Indian auto component or vehicle company has managed to get approval from the Chinese govt for procuring rare earth magnets. Also, there has been ""no clarity as yet"" on any timeline for a confirmed meeting with representatives of Chinese govt, despite intervention of Indian officials.The applications for sourcing magnets have been filed mainly by parts manufacturers who provide fully-built sophisticated component assemblies such as speedometers, electric motors, e-axles, electric water pumps, automatic transmission kits, speakers, sensors, and ignition coils (used in engines).The request for a meeting with Chinese representatives is being pursued not just by industry bodies of component makers (Auto Component Manufacturers Association) and vehicle manufacturers (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers), but also facilitated by officials in ministries.","Indian auto industry faces a magnet supply crunch, following restrictions placed by China. Some homegrown advanced material entities have come forward to build in-house supply chains. The companies have made presentations to govt, including the heavy industries ministry, and assured building of supplies within India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122010639,imgsize-72428,width-400,resizemode-4/122010639.jpg"
"Oil, inflation not immediate worries",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/oil-inflation-not-immediate-worries/articleshow/122010616.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt is drawing comfort from its diversified oil purchases but is keeping close tabs on the situation in the Strait of Hormuz, which accounts for nearly a fifth of global oil consumption, in the wake of the US attack on Iran.The Strait - which serves as the primary export route for Persian Gulf producers such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iraq - is crucial not just for crude supply - but also cargo headed to West Asian markets. Amid the threat of disruption by Iran, govt sources indicated that other routes will be explored.With Brent spiking to $90 a barrel, the margin of the oil companies selling petrol and diesel will get eroded but is unlikely to result in changes in pump prices due to the recent excise duty related changes. Although Opec may impact the overall calculations, India is estimated to have imported more oil from Russia this month than the combined quantity of shipments from West Asia. India's strengthening of ties with Russia on crude purchases post-Ukraine conflict are expected to come to its aid to ensure that there is no disruption, sources said.Beyond oil, there may be concerns on gas as large quantities come from the Gulf region.Besides, the price of piped cooking gas and CNG are linked to these and may impact the overall cost dynamics for industry too.Given that retail inflation in May had moderated to an over six-year low of 2.8%, price increase is not an immediate worry, but its future trajectory will weigh on policymakers, apart from adding to the already high levels of geo-political uncertainty.For trade, war risk insurance is seen to be a challenge, including its availability and pricing. ""Overall demand will take a hit. There is massive uncertainty,"" said Fieo director general Ajay Sahai.""Simultaneously, the situation in nearby Red Sea is deteriorating. Following Israeli airstrikes on Houthi forces on June 14-15, tensions have escalated, placing India's westbound exports at fresh risk. Nearly 30% of India's exports to Europe, North Africa, and US East Coast transit through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which is now increasingly vulnerable. If security conditions force shipping to reroute via the Cape of Good Hope, delivery times could increase by up to two weeks, sharply raising costs for Indian exporters,"" added Ajay Srivastava of GTRI, a trade research body.","Strait is crucial not just for crude supply - but also cargo headed to West Asian markets.

Why IPO-ready startups seek 'confidential' route,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-ipo-ready-startups-seek-confidential-route/articleshow/122010572.cms,"MUMBAI: Startups preparing to go public are increasingly opting for the confidential IPO filing route.After Swiggy's $1.4-billion IPO last year, filed through the confidential mode, sailed through, a clutch of firms including PhysicsWallah, Groww, Boat, and Shiprocket have taken this route. Lenskart and Meesho are also headed this way, sources said.While traditional companies such as Vishal Mega Mart have opted for this mode, and recently, Tata Capital chose to go confidential, the trend is picking up among startups that operate in a competitive market.For one, a confidential filing allows startups to keep their business metrics and performance away from the public eye. It also gives them the leeway to test the market appetite and accordingly decide on the IPO timing. Startups that are still firming up their path to profitability find this approach to be more prudent, investment bankers said.""The trend has been picked up by startups which are in very competitive businesses as it helps them to shield public disclosure of their KPIs and other sensitive business information like clients and vendors. This could also be useful in cases where issuers have a slightly longer time frame in mind for IPOs, yet want to get the regulatory clearance as Sebi observations are valid for an 18-month period in this route,"" Anurag Byas, director, equity markets solutions at Rothschild & Co, told TOI.The first batch of big startup IPOs was seen in 2021 when, fuelled by the pandemic-led surge in appetite for digital services, companies rushed to the markets to capitalise on consumer sentiment. Sebi introduced the confidential filing route in 2022.""Companies facing intense market competition prefer shorter windows for narrative battles in the public square. Less time spent on information wars is better for companies focused on frenetic growth and execution,"" said an executive at an IPO-bound startup which took the confidential route on condition of anonymity.Zepto, PhonePe, Pine Labs, and Lenskart are among a spate of startups that are eyeing a public listing. In a volatile market, the option of confidential filing becomes more favoured. ""With global rate cycles and geopolitical risks keeping equity markets volatile, startups prefer to keep their listing ambitions discreet. This route allows them to stay prepared, monitor the sentiment, and hit the market quickly when windows open up,"" said Prakash Bulusu, joint CEO at IIFL Capital.The practice of confidential filing is in place in developed jurisdictions, and the adoption in India gives issuers greater flexibility, said Kailash Soni, head of India equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs.""Companies are choosing to realign their strategies and focus on investor marketing after receiving Sebi's approval,"" said Gaurav Sood, MD & head, equity capital markets at Avendus Capital.This has helped issuers to consult with Sebi for views on regulatory issues and test waters from a valuation perspective, added Arka Mookerjee, partner at JSA.","After Swiggy's $1.4-billion IPO last year, a clutch of firms including PhysicsWallah, Groww, Boat, and Shiprocket have taken this route.

DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: Manoj Sharma doesn't fly by the book in the Kedarnath sector — he flies by sight, by wind, by instinct. ""We are flying in one of the world's most unforgiving regions with very little real-time weather support,"" he said. ""Operations in such large numbers are being conducted on pilot observation and visual reference. The weather is very unpredictable and changes very rapidly.""That reality, long known to those in the cockpit, now has the country's attention. In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents — two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage — all on the Kedar route. In one case, a Kestrel Aviation helicopter crash-landed near a road after a mechanical failure, injuring the pilot and damaging a vehicle.This is not an outlier year. In 2022, an Aryan Aviation chopper crashed near Kedarnath, killing seven. In 2023, Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) finance controller Amit Saini died after being struck by a tail rotor. And in 2013, a military rescue helicopter went down during flood relief, killing 20.The terrain is tough — but it is not the only challenge. The system built to manage it is, in many ways, still catching up to the traffic it supports.Pilgrimage flights have surged over the past decade, but the region lacks a dedicated air traffic control network.""There is no ATC control nor any weather station in these areas,"" said a veteran pilot. ""Flying in the narrow valley from Gaurikund to Kedarnath needs a lot of experience and safety awareness, as there are no landing sites on this stretch that can be used in an emergency or bad weather."" Another pilot added, ""There is no information provided on routes where major helicopter operations take place. Till such time these issues can't be addressed, these operations should immediately be stopped. ""This month, the civil aviation ministry suspended Aryan Aviation from Char Dham operations and grounded two TransBharat pilots who flew in unsuitable weather, suspending their licences for six months.UCADA — established by the state in 2013 to oversee civil aviation development and safety, including helipad infrastructure and coordination with private operators — has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review with all operators and setting up a command-and-control room to monitor real-time risks. DGCA has deployed officers to oversee safety, airworthiness and the functioning of the control centre.But many in the sector say these moves fall short. ""It seems there are no checks and balances in place,"" said one chopper operator. ""There is someone who replaced one inoperative part on a chopper with another inoperative part from another chopper to show that the part has been changed. Because of unscrupulous operators, conscientious operators and passengers are suffering.""Others point to a deeper culture of pressure and compromise. ""There have been five chopper crashes in the country within the last 1.5 months, which is the worst we have ever seen in helicopter operations in our country,"" said a senior pilot. ""Char Dham operations are one of the toughest... yet we still fly as if nothing needs fixing.""Another pilot was more direct: ""We need a complete stop on chopper operations for this yatra season. All stakeholders — owners, pilots, commercial, engineers, DGCA and UCADA — need to look within and change."" One added, simply, ""It's greed. That's what's driving this. Not safety.""","In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents. Two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage.

Piyush Goyal Says India Will Be $32 Trillion Economy By 2047, Sends Message To UK And Opposition

Frederick W Smith, the visionary founder and former CEO of FedEx Corp, passed away on Saturday at the age of 80, confirmed FedEx.Smith, who transformed the logistics industry with the concept of overnight delivery, leaves behind a legacy that reshaped global commerce and created one of the world’s most recognisable brands.“It is with profound sadness and a heavy heart that I share that Frederick W Smith, our founder and executive chairman, died earlier today,” wrote FedEx President and CEO Raj Subramaniam in a message to employees. “Fred was more than just the pioneer of an industry… he was the heart and soul of FedEx – its PSP culture, values, integrity, and spirit.”Smith's journey from a college student with an unconventional idea to the architect of a global shipping empire is legendary. As reported by the Commercial Appeal, the concept behind FedEx was born from a 1965 term paper he wrote at Yale University, proposing a system for time-sensitive deliveries—a vision few believed in at the time. “The overwhelming body of opinion said it wouldn’t work, or that we couldn’t raise the money,” Smith once recalled.FedEx officially began operations in 1973, and despite early financial and regulatory challenges, the company revolutionised air cargo delivery, offering businesses rapid shipment of urgent goods like electronics and machine parts.Before FedEx, such deliveries were largely dependent on passenger flights, lacking the efficiency Smith envisioned.Smith led FedEx for decades, helping grow it into a multibillion-dollar enterprise employing hundreds of thousands worldwide. Along the way, he forged relationships with major political figures, including George W Bush and John McCain, advocating for open trade and deregulation, key to FedEx’s business model.Born on August 11, 1944, in Marks, Mississippi, Smith faced adversity early in life. Raised in Memphis after his father's death, he overcame a childhood hip disorder to become an athlete in high school. He showed early promise as both a pilot and entrepreneur, co-founding a record label at age 15 and later mastering both aviation and economics at Yale.Jim Barksdale, former FedEx COO and later CEO of Netscape, once said, “He is the most impressive executive I have ever met.”Smith’s death marks the end of an era for FedEx and the logistics industry at large. As Subramaniam noted, “In the coming days and weeks, I know we will all find ways to honor his memory and pay tribute to his legacy.”","Frederick W Smith, the visionary founder and former CEO of FedEx Corp, passed away on Saturday at the age of 80.

It is a centre of gravity for countries seeking mutual respect and non-interference,” said Alipov, rejecting suggestions that the group was being shaped as an anti-West coalition, reported PTI. He noted that trade in national currencies was already underway between BRICS members.India’s BRICS Sherpa and Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs, Dammu Ravi, said discussions around a BRICS common currency are “at a very early stage.”“Today, for now, we are only looking at trade settlement in national currencies. Harmonisation of fiscal and monetary policies is very, very difficult to achieve,” he said.Brazilian Ambassador Kenneth da Nobrega echoed the sentiment, adding that while deeper integration like a common currency requires years of policy alignment, local currency trade was already showing results. “It’s a long way. But trading in local currencies? That’s already working,” Nobrega said.The summit comes amid geopolitical unease following warnings by President Donald Trump against any formal move by BRICS nations to undermine the US dollar’s dominance in global trade. The Trump administration’s tariffs have already drawn concern among developing economies.The summit is set to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and leaders of newly inducted members such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Indonesia.Ambassador Ina Krisnamurthi of Indonesia called for systemic reform, saying, “Our international order, the rules-based system, is crashing into the limits of its founding vision.” She said BRICS must evolve from “just dialogue to delivery,” focusing on climate finance, humanitarian relief, and data equity.“Right now, the Global South represents 85 per cent of the world’s population and 39 per cent of global GDP,” Krisnamurthi noted. “Yet multilateral institutions do not reflect this reality.”Citing a surge in the middle class across India, China and ASEAN, she said: “In 2000, only 150 million enjoyed middle-class living standards. Today, that number is 1.5 billion — double the total population of Western countries.”Egyptian envoy Kamel Galal said Cairo had always seen itself as a natural part of the bloc. “We are keen that the group should focus on areas of cooperation that enjoy consensus, rather than divisive issues,” he said, stressing a development-first agenda for Africa and the Middle East.Touching on global flashpoints like Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and Sudan, Galal called for reforming global institutions to better reflect “the evolving dynamics and rising role of developing countries.”Quoting the Egyptian Book of the Dead, he added, “What I hate is ignorance, smallness of imagination, the eye that sees no further than its own idol. All things are possible. Who you are is limited by who you think you are.”Replacing the oft-cited “conflict, crisis and challenge” narrative, Galal proposed a new vision for BRICS: “collaboration, complementarity, consensus and cohesion.”The panel concluded with a Q&A session that focused on the institutional future of BRICS, prospects of a unified currency, and the bloc’s ambitions under the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework.",Senior diplomats from leading member nations said the grouping is likely to intensify efforts toward settling trade in national currencies. They ruled out any imminent move toward a unified BRICS currency.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has introduced a 30.5 trillion won (USD 22.1 billion) supplementary budget plan aimed at revitalising the country’s weakening economy and supporting struggling citizens, reported news agency ANI, citing The Korea Herald.The proposal, which received Cabinet approval on Thursday, includes 20.2 trillion won in new spending and a downward revision of 10.3 trillion won in revenue projections, South Korea’s first such adjustment in five years.“Fiscal soundness and adherence to balanced budgeting are important, but the current downturn is too severe for the government to stand by,” Lee said at a Cabinet meeting, according to The Korea Herald. “It is time to put public finances to use.”President Lee emphasised two key priorities: stimulating economic growth and ensuring equitable distribution of benefits. Central to the stimulus is a universal cash handout scheme worth 10.3 trillion won, disbursed via spending coupons.All citizens will initially receive a minimum of 150,000 won, while lower-income households will get more. A second round of payments will exclude the top 10 per cent of earners, with the remaining 90 per cent receiving an additional 100,000 won.As per news agency Reuters, this marks the second supplementary budget of the year, coming just weeks after Lee's June 3 election victory. His expansionary fiscal approach aims to counter sluggish domestic demand, compounded by external shocks including US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes and internal political turmoil.The budget includes 2.7 trillion won for the beleaguered construction sector, which has seen four consecutive quarters of contraction.An additional 1.2 trillion won is earmarked for future-oriented industries, such as AI and renewable energy, while 5 trillion won is set aside for livelihood support. This includes 1.4 trillion won for distressed borrower debt relief and 1.6 trillion won to boost job-seeking aid and delayed wage support for vulnerable workers.The revenue forecast has been cut to 642.4 trillion won, down from 651.6 trillion won. Total government expenditure for 2025 has been revised upwards from 673.3 trillion won to 702 trillion won.The resulting integrated fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 110.4 trillion won, or 4.2 per cent of GDP, up from last year’s 3.3 per cent, with national debt forecast to exceed 1,300 trillion won, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 49 per cent.The government plans to fund the package with 19.8 trillion won in treasury bond issuances and an additional 10 trillion won from budget restructuring and reserves.Despite the expanding deficit, the finance ministry said Korea’s fiscal stance remains sustainable by global standards.

‘Maybe I’ll change my mind about firing him’: Trump revives threat to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell; calls him ‘total and complete moron’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/maybe-ill-change-my-mind-about-firing-him-trump-revives-threat-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell-calls-him-total-and-complete-moron/articleshow/121991162.cms,"Donald Trump revives threat to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump on Friday again floated the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, reigniting a long-standing feud over interest rates he claims should be much lower.In a scathing post on Truth Social, Trump called Powell a “numbskull” and a “total and complete moron,” blaming him for refusing to reduce rates despite what Trump called “virtually no inflation” in the economy.“I don’t know why the Board doesn’t override this Total and Complete Moron! Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him?” Trump wrote. “But regardless, his Term ends shortly,” Trump added.Powell’s current term ends in May 2026.Trump’s renewed criticism came just days after the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50%. Powell, backed by all six board members and five regional bank presidents, cited the need for patience as inflation trends slowly downward.Trump, however, insists rates should be slashed to between 1% and 2%, claiming such a move could save the country up to $1 trillion annually.“I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice, I’ve been neutral, and I’ve been nasty, and nice and neutral didn’t work!” Trump added.As per The Hill, Powell has previously stated that a sitting US president cannot lawfully remove a Fed chair except for cause, such as misconduct. A recent Supreme Court ruling also reinforced the Fed’s unique structure as a quasi-independent entity, limiting Trump’s ability to dismiss Powell directly.Trump's renewed focus on the Fed comes at a time when Fed Governor Christopher Waller, considered a top contender for Powell’s successor, suggested that rate cuts could be on the table by July, citing cooling inflation and signs of a weakening labour market.Nonetheless, Waller joined the unanimous decision to keep rates on hold this week.Adding to the speculation, Trump is reportedly preparing to announce a nominee to replace Powell, potentially well before the end of his term.Market analysts have warned that such an early move could create instability by introducing a “shadow chair” dynamic, where the sitting chair and the president's nominee pull policy in conflicting directions.Names circulating as potential replacements include Fed Governor Waller, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, former Trump nominee Judy Shelton, and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett. However, any new Fed chair must be confirmed by the US Senate, a process that could take months.Market strategists caution that the perception of a politically influenced appointment could erode confidence in the Fed’s independence. “Any Wall Street manager would tell you that Fed independence is the golden rule of markets,” said Callie Cox of Ritholtz Wealth Management.Despite the firestorm, Powell remains firm. In a previous statement, he said he would not step down if asked and reiterated that Fed decisions are grounded in economic data, not political pressure.Meanwhile, Trump's intensifying rhetoric and tariff plans continue to inject uncertainty into the central bank’s outlook for the second half of 2025.","US President Donald Trump on Friday again floated the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

While President Donald Trump has repeatedly pressed the Fed to cut rates, Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank would act cautiously, waiting to assess the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation and growth.“I think you'd want to start slow,” Waller said. “But start the process, that's the key thing.”Waller argued that central banks should “look through tariff effects on inflation” and instead focus on underlying price trends.Even if the tariffs pushed prices up temporarily, he said, it would likely be a “one-off level effect” that should not result in persistent inflation.His comments highlight a growing divide among Fed policymakers on the path forward. Powell had said Wednesday that while tariff effects could prove temporary, the Fed is “well-positioned to wait to learn more” before considering a shift in policy.Waller also rejected Trump’s recent suggestion that rate cuts could reduce debt-servicing costs. “Our mandate from Congress tells us to worry about unemployment and price stability, and that's what we're doing,” he said, adding, “It does not tell us to provide cheap financing to the US government.”","Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said the central bank could start cutting interest rates as soon as next month.

Asian equity markets closed on a mixed note Friday while crude oil prices climbed amid mounting geopolitical tension in the Middle East and uncertainty over whether the US will join Israel in its escalating war with Iran.US benchmark crude rose 15 cents to $73.65 a barrel and Brent, the global benchmark, was up 19 cents at $76.89.

Fear looms: Will Donald Trump name US Fed chair Powell’s successor soon? Here’s why markets are wary of ‘shadow chair’ signal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fear-looms-will-donald-trump-name-us-fed-chair-powells-successor-soon-heres-why-markets-are-wary-of-shadow-chair-signal/articleshow/121972446.cms,"AI image

US President Donald Trump has said he will soon announce a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, nearly a year before Powell’s term ends in May 2026 — a move investors warn could destabilise markets if it raises questions about Fed independence.Trump, who reappointed Powell in 2018, has repeatedly criticised the central bank for not cutting interest rates this year. Though he has stepped back from earlier threats to fire Powell, Trump told Reuters this month that a decision on the next Fed chair was coming “soon”.According to a Reuters report, markets are concerned that any premature nomination could create a “shadow chair” dynamic, where two conflicting voices steer monetary policy. “You’re going to have two people trying to steer the ship: One that’s actually steering it, and one that’s the backseat driver,” said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.The central bank’s policy-setting committee has 18 members, but the chair is viewed as its most powerful voice. “Whomever is appointed, the key thing to monitor is whether they are perceived as being a political appointee,” said Eric Winograd, chief US economist at AllianceBernstein.“And by that, I mean someone whose views change with the whims of the president.”Prediction markets have listed names such as White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Judy Shelton, a former Trump nominee, as top contenders. Fed Governor Christopher Waller also ranks high on Kalshi, another online market.The White House and Fed declined to comment. Shelton pointed to her Wall Street Journal op-ed on the Fed, while Warsh did not respond.Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said, “Any Wall Street manager would tell you that Fed independence is the golden rule of markets. To move away from that can introduce a whole host of issues.”Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, added, “It’s a risk that exists if people are too complacent on how this could all play out.”Powell’s leadership has faced persistent criticism from Trump, who called him a “numbskull” last week over the Fed’s refusal to cut rates again this year. The Fed’s policy rate remains at 4.25%–4.5%, with the last cut of 25 basis points taking place in December 2024.Any new chair must be confirmed by the US Senate, a process that could take months. Alex Grassino, global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management, said the markets would closely monitor any announcement: “You’re sort of setting up an alternate version of what you think policy should be.”“The optimal market reaction to any Fed chair nomination may be none at all,” added Felix Vezina-Poirier, strategist at BCA Research. “No reaction, or a decrease in long-term yields, would be a good sign that the market is digesting the Fed candidate.”Still, some investors believe Trump may wait until Powell’s term nears its end before naming a replacement. “If I were betting, I’d bet other,” said Winograd. “I’d bet the field.”","US President Donald Trump has said he will soon announce a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Rare Earth crisis deepens: China’s shipments sink to five-year low; down 74% YoY in May,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rare-earth-crisis-deepens-chinas-shipments-sink-to-five-year-low-down-74-yoy-in-may/articleshow/121969503.cms,"AI image

China's overseas shipments of rare earth magnets fell sharply in May, dropping to their lowest level in more than five years as export restrictions and heightened customs scrutiny disrupted global supply chains.According to data from the General Administration of Customs, China exported just 1,238 metric tons of rare earth permanent magnets last month, a 52.9% drop from April and the weakest monthly figure since February 2020. Compared to May 2024, shipments were down 74% year-on-year.April’s exports had already halved from March, marking a sustained downward trend that has unsettled industries worldwide, including automotive, aerospace, semiconductors, and military equipment manufacturing, reported Reuters.China, which produces more than 90% of the world’s rare earth magnets, began enforcing restrictions in early April on the export of seven types of medium-to-heavy rare earth products and certain magnets. While the move was intended to assert control over strategic resources, it has created confusion at customs, especially since a single customs code covers a wide range of magnet chemistries.Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that Chinese customs officials have become increasingly cautious in processing rare earth shipments, particularly those used in appliances and consumer electronics.They added that officials are unsure how to interpret and apply Beijing’s export control rules.China’s ministry of commerce announced Thursday that “a certain number” of export license applications had been approved, though no details were provided. Meanwhile, Chinese producers such as JL MAG Rare-Earth and Innuovo Technology have confirmed recently that they secured limited export licenses for some clients.Despite efforts to ease bottlenecks, overall exports of rare earth magnets for the January-May period stood at 19,132 metric tons, down 14.5% from the same period in 2024, the lowest five-month total since 2021.Earlier this month, Beijing agreed to expedite the export approval process as part of a broader effort to de-escalate trade tensions with the US. However, industry insiders say customs delays and regulatory ambiguity continue to hinder shipments.","China exported just 1,238 metric tons of rare earth permanent magnets last month, a 52.9% drop from April.

Dollar

Debt

Oil

Gold and crypto winning the game

Ever since US President Donald Trump took office, five months ago, his economic policies have unleashed widespread volatility across global financial markets, triggering investor pullback, a weakening dollar, and a sharp divergence in global stock performance.Here is a look at the financial roller-coaster rise:After years of dominating global markets, US stocks are now lagging behind — with Europe reaping the gains.Since the start of the year, Wall Street’s S&P 500 index has risen just two percent, while Frankfurt’s main index has surged 16 percent. London and Paris have also outperformed, recording gains of eight and three percent respectively.Kevin Thozet of investment firm Carmignac attributed the underperformance to President Trump’s inconsistent stance on tariffs.Thozet told AFP that the president’s shifting stance on tariffs had fuelled significant uncertainty around how they might affect economic growth.The US dollar has shed 10 percent of its value against the euro over the past six months, its steepest decline in three decades, according to Robert Farago, analyst at British investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.While President Trump’s tariff policies are seen as the primary driver, mounting concerns over the ballooning US debt, amplified by a costly presidential budget proposal, have further weighed on the currency.Though some have floated the idea of the Chinese yuan as a possible alternative to the dollar, ECB President Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the euro’s potential for a stronger international role.Still, significant hurdles remain for any currency seeking to challenge the dollar’s dominance.American debt has long been seen as a bedrock of the global financial system, with investors worldwide turning to US Treasury bonds as a safe haven.But that confidence is starting to crack. JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon recently warned that the ballooning US debt is a ""real problem"" and that bond markets are entering a ""tough time.""At the end of May, yields on 30-year US Treasury bonds crossed the key five percent threshold—an indication of waning faith in America's ability to manage its debt.""I've always told clients they need US debt if they want an asset that remains intact even in a disaster, but I think that's no longer the case,"" said Alexandre Hezez, strategist at Banque Richelieu.Adding to the concern, Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers noted that the dollar is weakening even as interest rates rise, ""a sign that money is leaving the US.""Donald Trump made lowering oil prices a key priority in his efforts to curb US inflation.In April, crude prices dipped below $60 a barrel, their lowest level since 2021. However, this drop was driven less by policy success and more by market fears. Investors, rattled by Trump’s tariff moves, anticipated a global economic slowdown that would weaken demand.More recently, rising tensions in the Middle East have pushed prices back up. The military escalation between Israel and Iran has driven oil back to around $75 a barrel.Gold has traditionally been seen as the ultimate safe haven during times of uncertainty and 2025 has been no different. Soaring demand has pushed its value up by nearly 30 percent since the start of the year.Much of this rally has been fuelled by major central banks, which are increasingly turning to gold over the US dollar to shore up their reserves.At the same time, Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind cryptocurrencies. Alongside his personal investments, his administration has introduced measures to integrate digital assets more firmly into the financial system.Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark for the first time shortly after the US election, capping off a nearly 60 percent gain over the past year.","Since the start of the year, Wall Street’s S&P 500 index has risen just two percent, while Frankfurt’S main index has surged 16 percent.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Stock market recommendations:Last week, the benchmark index Nifty began the week on a strong footing, supported by a series of positive macroeconomic and policy cues. The rally was largely attributed to S&P Global Ratings upgrading India’s sovereign outlook, which boosted investor sentiment around the country’s economic prospects.Additionally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of next-generation GST reforms, expected to be implemented by Diwali, added further strength to the rally. These reforms are aimed at simplifying the tax regime and easing the burden on consumers and MSMEs, thereby fostering broader economic growth.The positive momentum continued through the week, pushing the index to a high of 25153 by Thursday. However, despite the strong upmove, Nifty was unable to decisively clear the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous corrective move (from 25669 to 24337). This key resistance level led to profit-taking on Friday, resulting in the formation of a bearish candlestick with a long upper shadow, typically indicating selling pressure at higher levels.On the daily chart, the index has formed an Evening Star candlestick pattern, which is generally considered a bearish reversal signal. This, combined with the rejection at a crucial Fibonacci level, suggests that the bulls may be losing momentum, and a phase of consolidation or a corrective move could unfold unless fresh positive triggers emerge. Notably, during this pullback rally, the RSI failed to move past the 60 mark, indicating limited strength in momentum.Looking ahead, the 100-day EMA zone of 24650–24600 is expected to act as a key support area for the index. On the upside, the 25050–25100 zone will serve as a critical resistance. A decisive move beyond either of these levels could set the tone for the next directional trend in the index.Bank Nifty continued to underperform the broader market last week, reflecting ongoing weakness in banking stocks. After touching a weekly high of 56156, the index saw a sharp decline of over 1000 points, eventually closing at 55150, down 0.35% for the week. This decline led to the formation of a large bearish candle on the weekly chart, highlighting the dominance of sellers throughout the week.The relative weakness is also evident in the Bank Nifty/Nifty ratio, which has slipped to a 65-day low, underscoring the sector’s lag compared to the broader market. From a technical standpoint, the index is now trading below its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, both of which are trending downward — a sign of weakening short- to medium-term momentum.Adding to the cautious outlook, the daily RSI is nearing the 40 mark, indicating fading internal strength and increasing downside risk. Unless a strong reversal or positive trigger emerges, the index may remain under pressure in the near term.Looking at key levels, the 54900–54800 zone will act as immediate support. A sustained move below 54800 could open the door for further downside toward 54300, followed by the 200-day EMA at 53544. On the upside, the 55600–55700 zone will serve as a crucial resistance area for the index.The stock has broken out of a falling channel pattern last week, signalling a potential trend reversal. The breakout was accompanied by strong volume, lending credibility to the move. On the weekly chart, the stock has formed a sizeable bullish candle — its first significant positive close since May 2025, indicating renewed buying interest.Technically, the stock has also moved above its key moving averages on both the daily and weekly timeframes, reinforcing the bullish setup. Additionally, the daily RSI is hovering near the 60 mark, suggesting improving momentum. Overall, the combination of pattern breakout, volume confirmation, and improving momentum indicators points to a positive short-term outlook for the stock. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 466-462 level with a stoploss of Rs 445. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 510 in the short term.Last week, the stock witnessed a breakout from a Stage-2 cup pattern on the daily chart, supported by robust volume, confirming strong buying interest. This breakout marks a significant technical development, especially as the stock is now trading near its all-time high, reflecting strong bullish sentiment.From a trend perspective, the stock is well-positioned above all its key moving averages on both the daily and weekly timeframes, indicating a well-established uptrend. Moreover, momentum indicators are aligned with the bullish view, with the RSI firmly in bullish territory across both timeframes, suggesting sustained strength and room for further upside.Given the combination of pattern breakout, volume confirmation, and strong momentum, the stock appears poised for continued outperformance in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 225-223 level with a stoploss of Rs 215. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 250 in the short term.","According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, Apollo Tyres, and Nykaa are the top stock picks for this week.

Indian lenders account for 50% of Adani Group loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-lenders-account-for-50-of-adani-group-loans/articleshow/123490945.cms,"MUMBAI: The Adani group's dependence on Indian lenders has risen sharply. Domestic banks and financial institutions now account for half of its over Rs 2.6 lakh crore debt, up from 40% a year ago, helped by lower local funding costs after RBI rate cuts and narrower spreads following upgrades in credit ratings. The group's overall debt has increased by 20% in the 12 months ended June 2025.By end-June 2025, rupee loans made up 50% of borrowings, matching the share of dollar debt. PSU banks increased their exposure to 18% of the total from 13% last year, while NBFCs and financial institutions held 25% up from 19% a year ago. Dollar bonds, once 31% of borrowings, slipped to 23% while the exposure to dollar loans from foreign banks dipped to 27% from 28%. Private banks maintained their share at 2% even as lending increased 20%.In just two years, Indian banks' exposure has risen by $15 billion (about Rs 1.3 lakh crore), cementing their role in the group's financing. The group, in a presentation to investors, said that it has improved its ratings by steadying cash flows through long-term contracts in ports and power, while keeping leverage below industry averages. Cash reserves of Rs 60,000 crore, or a quarter of debt, provide a buffer.Recent transactions underline this tilt. Adani Airport raised $150 mn through a syndicated loan from Barclays, DBS, First Abu Dhabi Bank and MUFG, while Adani Ports borrowed $125 mn bilaterally from MUFG. Some of the airport unit's loans from domestic lenders have also been refinanced.The turn to local funding has coincided with stronger earnings. In FY25, Adani posted record EBITDA of Rs 89,806 crore, up 8.2%, with profit after tax of Rs 40,565 crore. Capex rose to Rs 1.26 lakh crore, but liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6 kept leverage in check. With over 90% of earnings tied to AA-rated or higher assets, the group has secured lower funding costs and sustained access to both domestic and foreign capital.Internationally, Adani remains India's largest issuer in offshore markets under the 144A/Reg S route, having raised $9 billion across maturities of up to 30 years.Over seven years it has refinanced $2.7 billion, aided by closer engagement with Moody's, Fitch and S&P, which have upgraded some companies in recent months.The issuance programme, the biggest by an Indian borrower, has attracted over 200 global investors, led by Asia (34%), the US and Canada (31%) and the EU (24%).","The Adani group's dependence on Indian lenders has risen sharply.

Sale of IDBI Bank a step closer after LIC gets Sebi nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sale-of-idbi-bank-a-step-closer-after-lic-gets-sebi-nod/articleshow/123491255.cms,"MUMBAI: Paving the way for the sale of IDBI Bank, Sebi has approved the reclassification of Life Insurance Corporation as a public shareholder from promoter of the bank once the sale transaction is concluded. The regulator's nod is subject to conditions, including LIC's voting rights being capped at 10%, no board representation or control over the bank's affairs, and reducing its stake to 15% or below within two years of the deal closure, as directed by RBI.The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) had conveyed Sebi's decision to LIC after the Cabinet's 2021 approval for strategic disinvestment in IDBI Bank.Recently, speculations that IDBI bank will be acquired by Emirates NBD were sparked when the Middle Eastern lender got a licence from RBI to operate a wholly owned subsidiary in India.LIC chairman R Doraiswamy, in a recent interview to TOI said, ""We acquired up to 51% of IDBI Bank because their recapitalisation need provided us an opportunity. We are now at 49.2%. The govt and LIC will jointly offload part of our stake during privatisation, but we will retain a significant holding post-sale and continue the relationship.""LIC became the owner of IDBI Bank in Jan 2019 when it acquired a 51% controlling stake for about Rs 21,624 crore to rescue the lender from mounting bad loans and weak capital buffers. With the insurance giant's infusion and takeover of management control, IDBI Bank was reclassified by RBI as a private sector lender.The deal provided IDBI Bank with capital for revival while giving LIC, which already held about 10.8% before the transaction, access to the bank's branch network for insurance distribution.Despite continued challenges around asset quality, the deal marked one of the biggest state-backed interventions to stabilise a struggling lender.","Sebi has approved the reclassification of Life Insurance Corporation as a public shareholder from promoter of the bank once the sale transaction is concluded.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Citigroup has a buy on Divis Laboratories with the target price at Rs 7,750. Analysts believe the recent weakness in the stock is a buying opportunity and they think valuations are reasonable due to sector tailwinds and the company's pipeline. They also feel that concerns around Orforglipron (oral GLP-1) Phase-III appear overdone as consensus is still building over $15 billion sales in 2030, which seems enough to estimate for Divi’s intermediate supplies of around $200 million to $300 million.Analysts also feel strong adoption in Tirzepatide and subsequent consensus upgrades in the product indicate an increase in the peptide GLP-1 TAM for Divi’s Labs. They also feel that concerns around Entresto going generic in the US may start fading away.JP Morgan has an underweight rating on Mazgaon Dockyard with the target price at Rs 2,468. Analysts feel risk-reward for the stock remains adverse despite recent price correction. The company’s Jan-March (Q4FY25) and April-June (Q1FY26) quarterly numbers were very weak due to provisioning related to cost overruns. More importantly, a large order award for P-75 Scorpene submarines is yet to materialize and has been delayed versus earlier guidance.If these awards get delayed further, it would pose a risk to FY28 revenue estimates given it takes two years for revenue to start being recognized. As of now, there appears to be little incremental positive news flow on the P-75I submarine award either.Morgan Stanley has an equal weight rating on Wipro with the target price at Rs 285. Analysts feel Wipro’s recent acquisition (Harmans Digital Transformation Solutions Business) to be accretive to its revenue but could be dilutive to margins and neutral to slightly dilutive to earnings per share for FY27. The acquisition allows Wipro to expand in new geographies like South Korea, and for gaining new skill sets around embedded software, digital engineering, IoT, etc. The acquired company’s customer base and priority sectors complement Wipro's.CLSA has an outperform rating on Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) with the target price at Rs 5,436. Analysts feel the Indian government’s approval resulted in HAL’s biggest order ever worth Rs 67,000 crore. This order should put to rest speculation of a likely delay in repeat order for HAL on delays in deliveries for its first order by over a year. This order also proves the delay was no fault of HAL, which was caused by a delay in engine supply from GE.Nomura has a buy on Alkem Laboratories with the target price raised to Rs 6,300. Analysts feel the stock’s valuations are reasonable given recovery in domestic growth and prospects at Enzene. The company has successfully gained traction in recent launches in anti-diabetes after patent expiry and intends to participate in the first wave of GLP-1RA opportunity. Analysts expect Enzene revenue to rise to Rs 800 crore by FY28, from Rs 360 crore in FY25. However, they feel profitability could still be low given higher overheads of CDMO operations.","Citigroup has a buy on Divis Laboratories with the target price at Rs 7,750.

Uber CEO says Rapido has overtaken Ola as top rival in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/uber-ceo-says-rapido-has-overtaken-ola-as-top-rival-in-india/articleshow/123486147.cms,"BENGALURU: Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that Rapido has emerged as the company’s toughest competitor in India, overtaking Ola in category position. “Ola used to be our main competition. I’d say now the tougher competition in India is Rapido. They got into two-wheelers and three-wheelers really aggressively with a zero-commission subscription model. Very scrappy as well. Ola is now kind of a distant third,” he told Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath on his podcast released Sunday.Khosrowshahi said Uber considers India one of its most important markets. The country is now the company’s third-largest globally in terms of trips, with over 1.4 million drivers across autos, two-wheelers, three-wheelers and cars. “India is a must win for Uber, not just tomorrow, but ten years from now,” he said.On Rapido’s approach, Khosrowshahi said its subscription model allowed drivers to retain higher earnings, giving it early traction. But he also noted that Rapido was “not making money” and would be tested on whether it can grow profitably. “We’ve got a lot of respect for them and we intend to compete really hard,” he said.The Uber chief also reflected on the broader quick commerce and mobility space, advising entrepreneurs not to overthink market size.“Businesses that succeed are always adapting. If there's a product market fit in a narrow segment, build there and expand step by step. Total addressable markets are for fundraising decks, not for building businesses,” he said.Khosrowshahi, who previously led Expedia, said Uber sees its role as a “local operating system” for everyday life, spanning rides, food, groceries and retail delivery. In India, Uber Eats was sold to Zomato in 2020 in a deal that gave Uber a stake later divested. “We’re not an investment company. My competency is to build operating businesses and grow them over time,” he said, when asked about exiting Zomato.He also touched on autonomous vehicles, describing them as inevitable but still years away from scale in India. “Drivers of autonomous cars are safer, but much more expensive, even in developed markets. For autonomous to come into India, it's going to take a long time. I think we’re looking at a 20-year horizon,” he said.On leadership, Khosrowshahi said his natural style is collaborative but he has learned to switch to “wartime decision-making” when required. Recalling pandemic layoffs at Uber, he said, “Sometimes collaboration doesn’t help. You have to say here’s what we’re going to do. Because my team sees me listening most of the time, they give me credit when I say we’re going this way.”Khosrowshahi added that despite Uber’s size, he tries to maintain the mindset of a disruptor. “I see our shortcomings much more than our accomplishments. Within these walls, we want to act like a startup. Outside, we have to recognize we are a big company, and that comes with responsibility,” he said.","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Rapido has emerged as the company’s toughest competitor in India, overtaking Ola in category position. “India is a must win for Uber, not just tomorrow, but ten years from now,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123486172,imgsize-729978,width-400,resizemode-4/123486172.jpg"

Political Row Erupts After Rahul Gandhi’s Convoy ‘Crushes’ Cop During Vote Adhikar Yatra

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday rode motorcycles as they resumed their 16-day ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Bihar’s Purnia, continuing their campaign against alleged irregularities in the state’s electoral rolls.The opposition leaders have accused the Nitish Kumar government of manipulating the voter list through the ongoing Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls.Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly termed the exercise as “vote chori,” while stressing that the march is a people’s movement against unemployment, inflation, migration, and the “theft of voting rights.”“Look at the vote-thief government — this is anger against unemployment and inflation. This revolution is against the theft of voting rights. A government formed by theft is not the people’s government,” Gandhi said in a post on X.On Saturday, Gandhi met makhana farmers in their fields in Katihar district, highlighting local livelihood issues during the march. The yatra, will cover over 1,300 km across 20 districts and is scheduled to conclude in Patna on September 1.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, who has been accompanying Rahul Gandhi through different stretches of the yatra, sharpened his attack on Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.Addressing a rally in Bhagalpur, Yadav declared, “This will be the last election of the Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. He will not become Chief Minister again. Do you want an original CM or a duplicate? We all need to be united and vote for change.”Reiterating his call for opposition unity, Yadav added that the movement was about taking “everyone along” in the fight against the ruling government.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah has announced that he will join Rahul Gandhi’s yatra in Bihar on August 29. “Rahul Gandhi ji took out a yatra in Bihar. I am going to join it on 29th August,” Siddaramaiah told reporters.","Congress MP and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday rode motorcycles as they resumed their 16-day ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Bihar’s Purnia.

Central banks independence debate: ECB's Lagarde warns subverting Fed could trigger disruption; says bank's autonomy as ‘critically important’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/central-banks-independence-debate-ecbs-lagarde-warns-subverting-fed-could-trigger-disruption-says-banks-autonomy-as-critically-important/articleshow/123488000.cms,"European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has warned that undermining central bank independence could unleash “dysfunction” and “instability,” issuing her remarks in the United States at a time when President Donald Trump is intensifying pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.Speaking in an interview aired on Fox News after attending the Jackson Hole meetings in Wyoming with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, Lagarde said such independence is “critically important.”“I have seen close hand what happens when a central bank stops being independent or when its independence is under threat,” said Lagarde, recalling her experience leading the International Monetary Fund between 2011 and 2019, AFP reported. “It becomes dysfunctional, it starts doing things that it shouldn’t do. And the next step is really — yes, it is disruption. It is instability, if not worse.”Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly demanded that the Fed lower rates to ease borrowing costs and accelerate growth. With Powell holding policy steady for months, the president has openly sought to weaken his standing in an effort to hasten his exit.Powell’s term runs until 2026, and a US president cannot remove a Fed chair without cause.

US-EU trade deal adds to shipping costs

New Delhi cites regulatory uncertainty

European postal services are suspending shipments to the United States after Washington announced the end of the long-standing “de minimis” tariff exemption, sparking confusion over new customs rules and duties.The de minimis exemption, which currently allows packages worth less than $800 to enter the US duty-free, will expire Friday. According to the US customs and border protection agency, 1.36 billion packages worth $64.6 billion were shipped under this rule in 2024.On Saturday, postal operators in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Italy said they would stop sending most merchandise to the US immediately. France and Austria will follow on Monday, while the UK’s Royal Mail will halt shipments on Tuesday. Royal Mail said items worth over $100, including personal gifts, will now face a 10% import duty.DHL, Europe’s largest shipping provider, said: “Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the US Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.” The company added it will no longer accept parcels from business customers bound for the US.Poste Italiane said, as quoted by ET, “In the absence of different instructions from US authorities ... Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23.” It added that DHL Express and other private couriers remain an option.In the Nordics, PostNord called the suspension “unfortunate but necessary.” In the Netherlands, PostNL spokesperson Wout Witteveen said the US is pressing ahead without a system to collect duties. “If you have something to send to America, you should do it today,” he told the Associated Press.Austria’s Austrian Post said the last commercial shipments to the US, including Puerto Rico, will be accepted Tuesday. France’s La Poste also announced a halt, saying the US did not provide time for postal operators to prepare.The move follows a new US-EU trade framework, which sets a 15% tariff on most products shipped from Europe, including packages under the $800 threshold. The US had already ended duty-free exemptions for goods from China in May, according to ET.PostEurop, an association of 51 European postal operators, warned that unless a solution is found by August 29, all members may suspend shipments to the US.This comes as India announced a temporary suspension of most international postal services to the US, effective August 25, 2025, in response to the regulatory changes.In a government statement, New Delhi said the move follows Executive Order No. 14324, issued by the US administration on July 30, 2025, which formally withdraws the de minimis exemption for goods valued up to $800.","European postal services are suspending shipments to the United States after Washington announced the end of the long-standing “de minimis” tariff exemption.

'Sovereign Brazil’



Exporters get BNDES support







Brazil’s state development bank, BNDES, on Friday announced a 10 billion reais ($1.85 billion) credit line to help companies affected by steep US tariffs. The facility is divided into funding for general operating expenses and exploring new export markets, complementing a 30 billion reais package unveiled earlier this month by the Brazilian government.According to BNDES, companies of all sizes with products subject to any level of US levies can access the credit line, reported Reuters.The move follows the government’s broader 30 billion reais ($5.5 billion) support plan, aimed at exporters impacted by the 50% tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump on several Brazilian goods.Other measures in the government’s plan, dubbed “Sovereign Brazil,” include postponing tax charges, providing 5 billion reais ($930,000) in tax credits to small and medium-sized enterprises through 2026, and expanding insurance coverage for cancelled orders. The program also encourages public procurement of goods that cannot be exported to the US, providing an alternative market for affected companies.Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva emphasised the need for calm and innovation during economic crises. “We cannot be scared, nervous and anxious when there is a crisis. A crisis is for us to create new things,” he said. “In this case, what is unpleasant is that the reasons given to impose sanctions against Brazil do not exist.”The US tariffs have been linked by Trump to the judicial situation of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, adding a political dimension to the trade dispute.The combined credit lines from BNDES and the federal government aim to provide Brazilian companies with liquidity, flexibility, and opportunities to explore alternative markets, helping them offset the impact of US tariffs.","Brazil's state development bank, BNDES, announces 10 billion reais ($1.85 billion) credit line to help companies affected by steep US tariffs.

Intel stake deal: Donald Trump secures 10% US ownership; CEO Lip-Bu Tan pledges American tech leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/intel-stake-deal-donald-trump-secures-10-us-ownership-ceo-lip-bu-tan-pledges-american-tech-leadership/articleshow/123466624.cms,"Donald Trump secures 10% US ownership in Intel (Picture credit: AP)

The United States government has acquired a 10 per cent holding in Intel, marking one of the most striking federal interventions in a private company since the 2008 auto bailouts.US President Donald Trump announced the agreement on Friday, describing the deal as “a great partnership for America and for Intel.”According to filings and statements, Washington is obtaining 433.3 million shares of the Silicon Valley chipmaker, issued at $20.47 apiece, well below Friday’s closing price of $24.80.On paper, the government begins with a $1.9 billion gain, as reported by the news agency AP.The $8.9 billion equity purchase is being funded through previously pledged CHIPS Act grants, together with an additional $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave programme. When added to earlier payments, the total government commitment rises to $11.1 billion.Although the stake makes the US one of Intel’s largest shareholders, it carries no voting rights or board representation, a point Intel emphasised in its own statement. The company’s chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, welcomed the move, saying Intel remained “deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made”, as per AFP.“We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership”, he added.The deal unfolded rapidly. Just weeks ago, Trump had urged Tan to step down over concerns about his past investments in Chinese firms. But after the Malaysian-born executive pledged loyalty to the US in a letter to employees and met with the president at the White House, the tone shifted, as per AP.By mid-August, discussions had advanced to the point where, according to the New York Times, Trump pressed Intel to part with a tenth of its equity.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick hailed the arrangement as “historic,” arguing that it converted what had been Biden-era subsidies into “equity for the American people.”Intel shares rose more than six per cent following the announcement.Still, critics have sounded alarms. As per AP, Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute warned the move was “a horrendous decision” that risks entangling politics with commercial choices.Tech analyst Rob Enderle called it a “slippery slope” toward nationalisation, as quoted by news agency AFP.Some investors, like Nancy Tengler of Laffer Tengler Investments, questioned whether taxpayers would see any return, warning of government meddling in corporate strategy.The intervention comes as Intel battles to recover from $22 billion in losses since 2023, large-scale layoffs, and missed opportunities in the smartphone and AI revolutions. While once a Silicon Valley titan, its $108 billion valuation is now dwarfed by Nvidia’s $4.3 trillion market capitalisation.Whether the government’s stake will help turn the company around, or simply raise new concerns about political interference, remains uncertain.As Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies was quoted as saying by the New York Times, “Once the government becomes a stakeholder, the question is: what will they do to protect their investment?”","US President Donald Trump announced the agreement on Friday.

Powell warns of uncertainties due to Trump's tariffs

Trump a strong critic of Powell

US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Friday that a potential rate reduction could occur during September's central bank meeting. However, he maintained a balanced stance, refraining from making definitive commitments about interest rate cuts. His comments acknowledged mounting concerns about employment conditions whilst emphasising that inflation risks continue to persist.Delivering a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, Powell said, “Risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside, a challenging situation when our goals, our intention like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. ”“Nonetheless, with policy and restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. Policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks, we will never deviate from that approach,” he said.“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising, and if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.“At the same time, GDP growth has slowed, notably in the first half of this year, to a pace of 1.2%, roughly half the 2.5% pace in 2024. The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending, as with the labor market. Some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.""We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags its effects on the economy. For this reason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to that outlook,"" he said.“This year, the economy has faced new challenges, significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth over the longer run, changes in tax, spending and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be,” Powell cautioned.“Changes in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply in this environment. Distinguishing cyclical developments from trend or structural developments is difficult. This distinction is critical, because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations, but can do little to alter structural changes,” he said.“When I appeared at this podium one year ago. The economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at five and a quarter to five and a half percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply, inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state upside. Risks to inflation had diminished, but the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions,” Powell said at the start of his speech.“Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year,” he said.This is Powell’s last Jackson Hole speech as the US Federal Reserve chairperson. His tenure concludes in May 2026.The Federal Reserve, scheduled to convene its next policy meeting in mid-September, has maintained interest rates between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent since their last decrease in December.The decision to keep rates steady was influenced by the strong labour market performance, as officials assessed the impact of Trump's comprehensive tariffs on America's economy.According to analysts, increased import tariffs could lead to price increases. The Federal Reserve generally maintains elevated interest rates as a strategy to control inflation effectively.The Federal Reserve chairperson's keynote address at last year's Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium suggested potential interest rate reductions, but experts caution the situation is less clear at present.""The Fed is in a tough position as inflation remains above target and downside risks to the labor market are intensifying,"" said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics according to an AFP report.US President Donald Trump has openly expressed his criticism of Powell, consistently stating that the Federal Reserve chairman has been ""too late"" in reducing interest rates whilst labelling him a ""numbskull"" and ""moron.""Trump criticised Powell regarding the Federal Reserve's headquarters refurbishment in Washington, suggesting that excessive expenses could warrant the central banker's dismissal.Trump later abandoned this stance but recently demanded Fed governor Lisa Cook's resignation, citing allegations of mortgage fraud.In response, Cook issued a statement declaring that she had ""no intention of being bullied to step down"" whilst noting her commitment to addressing questions about her financial records.","US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Friday that a potential rate reduction could occur during September's central bank meeting.

Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company is holding talks with the Trump administration over a potential new semiconductor for China, even as Washington maintains tight curbs on advanced chip sales citing national security.During a visit to Taiwan to meet Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC), Nvidia’s key manufacturing partner, Huang was asked about reports of a new “B30A” graphics processing unit (GPU) aimed at Chinese artificial intelligence data centres, AP reported. TSMC is the world’s largest chip maker.“I'm offering a new product to China for ... AI data centres, the follow-on to H20,” Huang said. “But that’s not our decision to make. It’s up to, of course, the United States government. And we're in dialogue with them, but it's too soon to know.”The B30A would be based on Nvidia’s Blackwell technology and is said to run at about half the speed of the company’s flagship B300 chips. Top-end Nvidia processors remain barred from China under US restrictions that seek to limit Beijing’s access to advanced computing power for military and AI applications.Huang praised the Trump administration for recently clearing the sale of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China, which had been halted in April. Approval was granted with a condition that Nvidia pay a 15% tax to the US government on such sales. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was asked to pay the same levy on exports of its MI380 chips to China.The approval was part of wider trade talks in which Washington and Beijing agreed to scale back some non-tariff measures. China granted additional permits for exports of rare earth magnets to the US, while Washington removed restrictions on chip design software and jet engines. Following Huang’s lobbying efforts, Nvidia was also allowed to resume H20 sales to Chinese customers.Asked about the tax condition, Huang declined to comment directly but said Nvidia valued the chance to sell H20 chips to China. He also rejected suggestions that such sales carried security risks for the US.“We have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,” Huang said. He added that Nvidia was also in talks with Beijing to assure regulators about the product’s integrity.China’s Cyberspace Administration had recently posted a notice online raising what it called “serious security issues” in Nvidia’s chips. Citing US AI experts, it alleged the processors included “mature tracking and location and remote shutdown technologies.” Nvidia was asked to clarify these claims and provide documentation.Huang said the company was surprised by the accusations. “As you know, they requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20s for some time. And I’ve worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses. And so hopefully this will be resolved,” he said.Reports in Chinese media have suggested authorities were also angered by comments from US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who argued that Washington’s policy was to limit China’s access to cutting-edge chips.“We don't sell them our best stuff,” Lutnick told CNBC. “Not our second-best stuff. Not even our third best, but I think fourth best is where we've come out that we're cool.”China’s ruling Communist Party has prioritised self-reliance in advanced technology but continues to rely heavily on foreign semiconductor know-how.",Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company is holding talks with the Trump administration over a potential new semiconductor for China.

They are dealing with the vast range of goods traded between the two economies in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, involving $2 trillion in annual trans-Atlantic business.The 3 1/2-page text represents a political commitment and is not legally binding. It contrasts with the typical format for trade agreements, which can be hundreds of pages long and carry legal force.The key provisions are the 15% tariff on most EU goods, a zero rate on U.S. cars and other industrial goods exported to the 27-member EU, and a range of exceptions to the 15% rate for aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, with other sectors to be added for goods crucial to each other's economies. Those goods would face lower tariffs from before President Donald Trump's tariff onslaught.""The EU has agreed to open its $20 Trillion market,"" Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said on X. ""The second largest in the world behind the great USA.""He said the deal was ""a major win for American workers, US industries, and our national security. Tariffs should be one of America's favorite words.""European officials have had to defend the deal against dismay from businesses and member governments at the higher tariffs and criticism that the EU gave away too much. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sold the deal as granting quick relief from the even higher U.S. tariff on EU cars of 27.5% and as opening the way for further negotiations that could exclude more goods from the 15% tariffs. The deal provides that the lower tariff on cars would apply retroactively from Aug. 1 if the EU can introduce legislation to implement its part of the deal by then, which EU officials say they will do.""Faced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our member states and industry and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is not the end of the process.""The chief EU trade negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, echoed those sentiments. ""The alternative was a trade war with sky high tariffs ... it builds confidence. It brings stability,"" he said.Economists say higher tariffs slow economic growth and will be reflected in higher consumer prices.One category of goods not excluded from tariffs on EU goods was wine and spirits, which had enjoyed zero tariffs on both ends since a 1997 trade deal. Sefcovic, said EU officials had not won an exemption ""yet"" but hoped to in future talks and that ""doors are not closed forever"" on that issue.That means American distillers face zero tariffs in Europe the short term, but also the possibility of EU retaliation down the line, said Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. ""Without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits, American distillers do not have the certainty to plan for future export and job growth without the fear of retaliatory tariffs returning,"" Swonger said in a statement.The EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs on US goods including wine and spirits until Feb. 5, 2026.Proposals to exempt a certain amount of EU steel imports, known as a tariff rate quota, have been left unresolved pending more talks.The 15% tariff is much higher than tariff levels on both sides from before Trump began imposing his tariffs, when they averaged in the low single digits. The tariffs are paid on the U.S. end, either absorbed by American businesses importing the goods, lowering their profits, or passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices at the cash register.The deal also includes nonbinding EU commitments to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and for EU companies to invest $600 billion in the U.S. In both cases, the money would come from private companies and is based on assessment by the European Commission on what companies were planning to spend.",The deal imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

US Senator Claims India Cut Russian Oil Buys And Sought Trump Tariff Relief Amid Pressure Bid On Oil

State-run Indian Oil Corp and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy have increased their purchases of Russian crude in January. This comes even as India’s overall imports from Russia have declined under US sanctions. Reliance Industries , India’s largest buyer over the past year, along with several other refiners, has not received any supplies this month. This leaves Indian Oil, Nayara and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) as the main importers so far, according to ET.India’s imports of Russian oil averaged 1.18 million barrels per day in the first half of January, down about 30 per cent from both the same period last year and the 2025 average, according to Kpler, a global real-time data and analytics provider. Imports were roughly 3 per cent lower compared with December 2025.US sanctions have significantly narrowed the buyer pool for Russian crude, restricting shipments to just a few Indian refiners. Indian Oil received about 500,000 barrels per day, accounting for nearly 43 per cent of total Russian crude shipped to India. This was Indian Oil’s highest average intake since May 2024 and 64 per cent higher than its 2025 average.Nayara Energy, which has become fully reliant on Russian oil since being sanctioned by the European Union last year, was the second-largest buyer in January. Its imports of approximately 471,000 barrels per day—about 40 per cent of Russian volumes shipped to India this month—were the highest in at least two years and 56 per cent above its 2025 average intake. BPCL received around 200,000 barrels per day, slightly above its average of 185,000 barrels in 2025.Other major refiners, including Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd and Reliance Industries, did not receive any Russian cargoes in the first half of January.Reduced demand from some Indian and Chinese buyers has prompted Russian suppliers to increase discounts on crude. Industry executives said discounts on Russia’s flagship Urals crude for delivery to Indian ports now trades at $5-6 per barrel, up from $2 before US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil last October.Indian Oil has increased its intake this month to take advantage of these discounts.Indian refiners began recalibrating their strategy on discounted Russian crude after the US criticised India’s purchases last year and threatened additional tariffs. Some refiners moderated imports after an additional 25 per cent tariff took effect in late August on Indian exports to the US.However, US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil have intensified caution among Indian refiners. Most have stopped receiving cargoes from sanctioned suppliers, with the exception of Rosneft-backed Nayara, according to industry executives. Reliance Industries, which has a term deal with Rosneft, has halted shipments from both Rosneft and other Russian suppliers, Kpler data showed.","State-run Indian Oil Corp and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy have increased their purchases of Russian crude in January.

On Saturdays, many bank customers often face confusion over whether branches are open or closed, as banks do not operate on all Saturdays each month.As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules, banks remain closed on the second and fourth Saturdays, while they function on the first, third and fifth Saturdays, unless a state-specific holiday applies.Banks are open today across most states, as January 17 falls on the third Saturday of the month. However, banks are closed in Tamil Nadu on account of Uzhavar Thirunal, a state-specific holiday.Uzhavar Thirunal, also known as Pongal or Makar Sankranti in other parts of India, is a major Tamil harvest festival celebrated in mid-January. The festival marks the end of winter and the beginning of the rice harvest season. It is observed as a public holiday in Tamil Nadu.Customers are advised to check state-wise holidays before planning in-branch visits, especially during festive periods. It is important to note that digital banking services such as UPI, mobile banking, internet banking and ATMs remain operational even on bank holidays.","Banks are open today across most states, as January 17 falls on the third Saturday of the month.

Defence Spending Can Fuel Growth, Says CDS Anil Chauhan As India Rethinks Guns Versus Butter Debate

Defence Budget 2026 - 4 Point Approach

FICCI notes that in Budget 2025, the Ministry of Defence was allocated Rs 6,81,210.27 crore for FY 2025–26. This was a 9.53% rise over the Budget Estimates for FY 2024–25. The industry body suggests that while the government maintains the growth of approximately 10% in the overall budgetary support for the Ministry of Defence in the coming year, the share of capital outlay should be increased to 30% from around 26% earlier. “Additional capital outlay will help in modernisation of military infrastructure, particularly for investments in frontline assets, UAVs, counter UAV systems, electronic warfare systems and air defence systems in border areas,” it says.

FICCI is of the view that the budgetary allocation for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) needs to be stepped up. Last year the budget was increased by 12.4% to Rs 26,816.82 crore in FY 2025–26. “The overall allocation for DRDO should be increased by Rs 10,000 crore in the upcoming budget. This will financially strengthen the DRDO in developing new technologies with special focus on fundamental research for frontier technologies in collaboration with private parties through flagship scheme of DRDO i.e. Technology Development Fund and will assist the development of Deep Technology in the defence sector.”

The industry body notes that under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, the government has made notable progress in defence indigenisation through setting up of Defence Industrial Corridors in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. This momentum needs to be strengthened further, says FICCI, advocating for establishing an Eastern India Defence Industrial Corridor. “Synchronising with the ‘Purvodaya Scheme’ , it would rejuvenate the industrial clusters in Eastern India and shall spur job creation, stimulate R&D, and establish India as a global hub for defence exports, while securing national interests across all three borders,” FICCI says.

Budget 2026 should also focus on giving an impetus to defence exports which have risen at a compound annual growth rate of 46% between 2016–17 and 2023–24. This has largely been driven by higher exports from private sector firms. The central government aims to achieve defence exports worth Rs 50,000 crore by 2028-29. FICCI suggests that the government considers setting up a Defence Export Promotion Council (DEPC) that can co-ordinate with armed services, their foreign directorates, DPSUs, private manufacturers, MEA, Indian embassies, and MoD and communicate with foreign governments and buyers.

Budget 2026 for defence: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s Union Budget 2026 should look to prioritise growth-enhancing productive capital expenditure, with a special focus on the defence sector at a time when the global environment is marked with uncertainty, says FICCI in its pre-Budget memorandum.According to the industry body, India needs to lay special emphasis on technology-driven defence innovation. “India’s external security environment today is marked by heightened uncertainty and rise in disputes and conflicts. India’s adversaries are investing heavily in advanced military technologies such as autonomous weapons, hypersonic systems, UAV swarms, and AI-enabled warfare, posing heightened risks. A strong, modern, and well-resourced defence architecture has thus become critical for safeguarding India’s territorial integrity and preserving strategic autonomy,” FICCI has said in its Budget 2026 wishlist.FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques using artificial intelligence, and not just platform-driven enhancements.“Future warfare will be defined by technology-driven, multi-domain and information-centric operations. Conflicts will increasingly span land, air, sea, cyber, space and electromagnetic spectrum domains. For India, preparing for such challenges requires a shift from platform-centric to networked, integrated, AI-enabled capabilities backed by robust indigenous defence innovation,” it says.According to FICCI, increasing the defence budget should not just be about a budgetary choice but a strategic imperative. So what should the Union Budget 2026 for defence focus on? FICCI advocates a four-pronged approach:","In Budget 2025, the Ministry of Defence was allocated Rs 6,81,210.27 crore for FY 2025–26. FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques.

Budget 2026: The urgent need to tackle long-pending and long drawn-out tax litigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-the-urgent-need-to-tackle-long-pending-and-long-drawn-out-tax-litigation/articleshow/126556471.cms,"As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals).

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Here are top five issues that

Budget 2026

should tackle:

1. Reduce pendency before CIT(A) and allow refund of taxes collected during pendency of appeal

2. Rationalise provisions to facilitate obtaining full stay of demand during pendency of appeals

3. Reducing administrative inconvenience and hardship

4. Avoiding repetitive appeals by the Revenue

5. Strengthening the advance ruling mechanism

As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to the far more structural problem of long-pending direct tax litigation. On the ground, businesses argue that predictability, timeliness and administrative efficiency in dispute resolution matter as much as headline tax rates—particularly for capital-intensive sectors such as manufacturing.The scale of the problem is substantial. As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals), involving disputed demands of about ₹18.16 lakh crore. Protracted disputes result in working capital being locked up for years, management attention diverted from productive activity, and depressed valuations when Indian promoters seek foreign investment.Industry body FICCI has flagged the mounting backlog at the CIT(A) level as a critical bottleneck in the dispute resolution framework.The first appellate authority, meant to serve as an effective corrective forum, has instead become a point of prolonged delay.FICCI points out that pendency increased sharply after the faceless appeal regime was rolled out in 2021. While faceless appeals were introduced to eliminate physical interface and improve transparency, the absence of effective monitoring and the unfamiliarity of both officers and taxpayers with the technology have led to repeated notices, duplication of submissions and delayed disposals. Even where taxpayers have filed detailed responses on the portal, they are often asked to resubmit information without clarity on what additional inputs are required. Virtual hearings, when sought, are not granted liberally, and even when conducted, limitations in document presentation weaken effective representation.A key procedural gap, according to FICCI, is the absence of any time limit for assessing officers to submit remand reports called for by the CIT(A), coupled with ambiguity over whether jurisdictional officers or faceless units are responsible for such reports. Meanwhile, parallel penalty proceedings are routinely initiated while quantum appeals remain pending, resulting in both quantum and penalty matters piling up at the first appellate stage.The industry body warns that the litigation lifecycle—already 12 to 15 years before Covid—has now lengthened by another five years. This not only delays revenue collection for the government but also forces companies to carry disputed tax demands as contingent liabilities, adversely impacting share valuations during fund-raising or stake sales.To address this, FICCI has recommended prioritised disposal of appeals involving high-pitched assessments, scrutiny cases, matters where detailed submissions have already been filed, issues covered by High Court or Supreme Court rulings, and appeals pending for over five years. It has also called for filling nearly 40% vacancies at the CIT(A) level and introducing a dual-track system, with fast-track disposal for simple, low-value cases and a detailed track for complex, high-value disputes, backed by differentiated timelines and targets.Tax professional Sandeep Bhalla, Partner at Dhruva Advisors, notes that appeals pending before the CIT(A) for more than two years cause serious hardship, particularly where disputed demands continue to remain outstanding. He argues that in such cases, taxpayers should not be compelled to wait indefinitely and should be allowed to approach the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) directly.Bhalla suggests a structured mechanism under which the assessee could approach the Range Head (Additional or Joint Commissioner), who would prepare a concise factual and legal factsheet. This, along with the appeal records, could then be placed directly before the Tribunal for adjudication. Such a process, he believes, would help decongest the CIT(A) level while ensuring quicker resolution of long-pending disputes.At the same time, Bhalla emphasises that institutional accountability must be built into the system so that appeals remaining undisposed beyond two years without taxpayer fault are treated as a measurable performance failure rather than an administrative inevitability.FICCI has also called for a rethink of the current framework governing stay of disputed tax demands. Although CBDT instructions provide that a stay may be granted on payment of 20% of the disputed demand, taxpayers are often required to make this payment even when the issue has been decided in their favour in earlier years.Compounding the problem, refunds for subsequent years are routinely adjusted by the Central Processing Centre (CPC) against demands that are formally stayed, because stay orders are not digitally integrated with CPC systems. According to FICCI, this defeats the very purpose of a stay and intensifies liquidity stress for businesses.To resolve this, the industry body has suggested creating a real-time interface enabling assessing officers to upload stay orders so that stayed demands are automatically excluded from refund adjustments. It has also proposed allowing alternative forms of security—such as bank guarantees or indemnities—in appropriate cases instead of insisting on a cash pre-deposit, noting that international tax administrations adopt similar risk-based approaches without compromising revenue protection.Bhalla highlights that even after taxpayers succeed in appeals, delays in passing Orders Giving Effect (OGEs) often render appellate relief meaningless. Refunds remain on paper for months, or even years, resulting in continued cash-flow strain.He recommends that OGEs be system-driven and mandatorily passed within three months, with interest payable for departmental delays made personally recoverable from the concerned assessing officer. Mandatory uploading of scrutiny and compliance reports on the tax portal, he argues, would enhance transparency and accountability.Bhalla also points to the largely mechanical nature of rectifications under section 154 against CPC adjustments under section 143(1). He suggests that taxpayers should be allowed to file detailed reconciliations, that CPC orders rejecting rectification must give clear reasons, and that a virtual hearing should be provided wherever adjustments are proposed to be confirmed.Despite settled judicial precedents, the Revenue continues to litigate recurring issues, adding to the backlog. Bhalla recommends that the CBDT issue authoritative position papers on key settled matters, particularly those affecting specific industries, and hold field officers accountable for filing appeals contrary to binding rulings.Bhalla also flags concerns around the functioning of the Board for Advance Rulings, which replaced the Authority for Advance Rulings in 2021. More than four years on, the mechanism has failed to deliver the certainty it was meant to provide, especially for cross-border and high-value transactions, underscoring the need for corrective measures in Budget 2026.As India positions itself as a preferred investment destination, the credibility of its tax dispute resolution system will be closely watched by both domestic and global investors. Meaningful reforms that reduce pendency, ensure timely refunds and curb avoidable litigation could significantly improve confidence on the ground. Budget 2026, therefore, has a chance to signal that tax certainty and administrative efficiency are central to the government’s growth strategy.","As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) Industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to long-pending direct tax litigation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126556606,imgsize-148077,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-tax.jpg"
Tech wreck: Job cuts at TCS drag Big 5 IT companies' net hiring to 17 in 9 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tech-wreck-job-cuts-at-tcs-drag-big-5-it-companies-net-hiring-to-17-in-9-months/articleshow/126592825.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: With just 17 net hires in the first nine months of the 2025-26 financial year, India's top five IT companies eased off the hiring throttle and moved firmly into caution mode. The muted performance marked a sharp contrast to the 17,764 net additions recorded during the same period last year, highlighting how the hiring engine became leaner amid AI-led delivery models. In fact, at some IT companies, recent acquisitions propped up headcount numbers, without which net additions would be flat or even negative.Headcount additions running into just the tens across the top five Indian IT firms continued to be a casualty, raising concerns for students. This reflected deep hiring restraint amid macro uncertainty, pullbacks in discretionary spending, and AI-led productivity pressures, with early signs of a decoupling of headcount growth from revenue. TCS remained the biggest drag on overall numbers, shedding 25,816 employees in the first nine months of the current financial year after it announced that it will cut 2% of its workforce, or over 12,000 employees, largely impacting mid-level and senior executives.Over the same period, Infosys added 13,456, Wipro 9,740, HCLTech 1,885, and Tech Mahindra 752 employees, respectively.In the Dec quarter alone, the combined headcount of the five Indian IT firms declined by 2,174 employees, with TCS alone seeing a sharp reduction of 11,151. Infosys and Wipro, however, added 5,043 and 6,529 employees, respectively. Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based IT advisory firm HfS Research, said the headline number is stark but reflected a structural shift rather than a cyclical pause. He said there is a fundamental move away from the historic pyramid-led growth model, where headcount expansion powered growth, as three converging forces reshape the IT services industry. Fersht said discretionary spending remained under pressure, with clients sweating existing assets and pushing harder on productivity. ""Second, AI and automation are starting to show up in delivery metrics. While AI is not yet driving large-scale revenue acceleration, it is clearly reducing the need for incremental hiring, especially at junior and mid levels. This is where the decoupling between revenue and headcount is becoming visible,"" he said.TCS, however, refrained from calling out its 40,000 campus hiring number this year which it did in the past, signalling a more cautious stance on fresher recruitment. Firms such as TCS are actively rebalancing their workforce, with the scale of reductions pointing to internal productivity resets, role consolidation, and a sharper focus on utilisation rather than growth-led hiring. Organic growth across the IT sector remained anemic, with demand recovery uneven, deal ramp-ups slower, and discretionary spending subdued. Margins on large deals continued to face pressure as competitive pricing and higher productivity commitments limited profitability. While global capability centres (GCCs) continued to add talent, hiring was no longer at the same pace as before, with industry experts noting that recruitment is highly selective and skill-specific.Ray Wang, CEO of US-based Constellation Research, said a combination of exponential AI-driven efficiency and changing client expectations created a low-hire, low-fire environment. ""Single-digit growth is not only being cheered but is becoming the new reality. Services firms that have gained the most ground are AI-first, AI-exponential players that are able to exceed $100,000 in revenue per employee with around 25% digital labour. This mega trend has permanently reshaped the services industry landscape,"" he said.","With just 17 net hires in the first nine months of the 2025-26 financial year, India's top five IT companies eased off the hiring throttle.

‘Be Ready To Pay…’: Trump SHOCKS NATO Allies With New Tariff Warning To Acquire Greenland

European Union leaders on Saturday warned US President Donald Trump against using tariffs as leverage in his bid to acquire Greenland, cautioning that such measures could severely damage transatlantic relations.This comes as Trump said that from February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face a 10 per cent tariff on all goods exported to the United States.Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump’s comments had come as a surprise, stressing that Greenland’s security posture was already aligned with broader Arctic stability. ""The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the president refers, is precisely to enhance security in the Arctic,"" Rasmussen said in a statement sent to AFP.Rasmussen added that Copenhagen was coordinating closely with Brussels and other partners on the issue. ""We are in close contact with the European Commission and our other partners on the matter,"" he said, just days after attending talks at the White House with US and Greenlandic officials on the Greenland question.At the EU level, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa issued a joint statement hours after Trump threatened tariffs of up to 25 per cent on multiple European nations.""Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,"" they wrote in a post on social media.""Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty,"" they added.""The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,"" the statement further said, adding, ""Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the US.""In Germany, senior European Parliament member Manfred Weber warned that Trump’s latest remarks could derail the EU–US trade deal agreed last year. Weber heads the European People’s Party, the largest political group in the European Parliament.""The EPP is in favour of the EU–U.S. trade deal, but given Donald Trump’s threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,"" Weber said in a post on X.""The 0% tariffs on U.S. products must be put on hold,"" he added.Brussels and Washington reached a preliminary agreement in July under which most EU exports would face a 15 per cent US levy. However, both sides continue to seek further concessions, leaving the future of the deal uncertain amid rising political tensions.","US President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 25 per cent on multiple European nations.

Safeguard and quotas

ASUNCION: South American and European Union officials on Saturday signed a major trade deal, which they hailed as sending a powerful message at a time of tariff threats, global uncertainty and protectionism.The deal between the 27-nation European Union and Mercosur bloc members Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay creates one of the world's largest free trade areas after 25 years of tricky negotiations.It was given fresh impetus amid the sweeping use of tariffs and trade threats by US President Donald Trump's administration, which has sent countries scrambling for new partnerships.Trump on Saturday threatened multiple European nations with tariffs of up to 25 percent until he manages to gain control of the Danish territory Greenland.""We choose fair trade over tariffs, we choose a productive long-term partnership over isolation,"" EU chief Ursula Von der Leyen said at the signing ceremony in Asuncion, Paraguay.Paraguay's President Santiago Pena also praised the treaty as sending ""a clear signal in favor of international trade"" in ""a global scenario marked by tensions.""European Council head Antonio Costa said the deal stood in contrast to ""the use of trade as a geopolitical weapon.""And Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said the deal was a ""bulwark ... in the face of a world battered by unpredictability, protectionism, and coercion.""Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- a key architect of the accord -- was unable to attend the ceremony due to scheduling conflicts, and met with Von der Leyen in Rio de Janeiro on Friday where he praised it as a victory for multilateralism.In Paraguay, leaders said the treaty would bring jobs, prosperity, and opportunities to people on both sides of the Atlantic.Together, the EU and Mercosur account for 30 percent of global GDP and more than 700 million consumers.The treaty -- which still needs to be approved by the EU parliament and ratified by each Mercosur nation -- eliminates tariffs on more than 90 percent of bilateral trade.It is expected to come into force by the end of 2026.The deal will favor European exports of cars, wine and cheese, while making it easier for South American beef, poultry, sugar, rice, honey and soybeans to enter Europe.This has angered European farmers, who have rolled tractors into cities like Paris, Brussels and Warsaw to protest a feared influx of cheaper goods produced with lower standards and banned pesticides.""We have good quality Irish beef and good standards here, and they don't have the same standards in South American countries,"" said Trisha Chatterton, a 50-year-old farmer at a protest in Ireland earlier this month.""It's not fair,"" said Luis, a 24-year-old Belgian cattle farmer who took part in a December protest that turned ugly, as demonstrators set piles of tires on fire and hurled potatoes at police.Key power Germany, as well as Spain and the Nordic countries, strongly support the pact, eager to boost exports as Europe grapples with Chinese competition and a tariff-happy administration in the White House.Some in South America are also wary about the impact of the treaty.In Argentina, it is estimated that there could be a loss of 200,000 jobs just from the dismantling of the local automotive industry, trade and investment researcher Luciana Ghiotto told AFP.In a bid to allay fears, the European Commission announced a crisis fund and safeguards allowing for the suspension of preferential tariffs in case of a damaging surge in imports.However Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei warned against quotas and safeguard which ""will significantly reduce the economic impact of the agreement and will go against its essential objective.""According to EU estimates, European exports to Mercosur are expected to rise by 39 percent, while Mercosur exports to the EU could increase by 17 percent.By 2040, the agreement is projected to boost EU GDP by 77.6 billion euros and Mercosur GDP by 9.4 billion euros.",South American and European Union officials sign a major trade deal.

European leaders have pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat, warning that using trade penalties in connection with Greenland is ""wrong"" and could damage transatlantic ties.Trump, on Saturday, announced a 10% tariff on all goods entering the United States from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland, effective February 1.After the threat, leaders across Europe have emphasised that Greenland’s future cannot be controlled through economic pressure and insisted that security cooperation in the Arctic must not be turned into a trade dispute.British PM Keir Starmer took to X, saying that the status of Greenland was not open to outside interference and criticised the use of tariffs against Nato partners. ""Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes. We have also made clear that Arctic Security matters for the whole of Nato and allies should all do more together to address the threat from Russia across different parts of the Arctic.He further added, ""applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.""French President Emmanuel Macron said that France’s foreign policy is based on defending sovereignty and independence and warned that Europe would not yield to threats.""France is committed to the sovereignty and independence of nations, in Europe and elsewhere ... Tariff threats are unacceptable and have no place in this context. Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld. It is in this spirit that I will engage with our European partners.""Sweden’s PM Ulf Kristersson also criticised the tariffs, saying that Stockholm would not accept getting ""blackmailed"" and called for a joint European response. ""We will not let ourselves be blackmailed. Only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.""He further added, ""I will always stand up for my country, and for our allied neighbors. This is an EU issue that affects many more countries than those now being singled out. Sweden is now having intensive discussions with other EU countries, Norway, and the United Kingdom for a coordinated response.""European Council President Antonio Costa said that Europe and the wider international community must defend territorial integrity and sovereignty, warning that tariffs could spark a dangerous escalation. ""Territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law. They are essential for Europe and for the international community as a whole. We have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through Nato. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.""Costa further highlighted the bloc's support for Denmark and Greenland. ""The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland. Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the US. Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty. ""Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump’s remarks were unexpected and insisted that the increased military presence in Greenland was aimed at stability, not confrontation. ""The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the president refers, is precisely to enhance security in the Arctic,"" he said, adding that Denmark was coordinating closely with Brussels and other partners.""We are in close contact with the European Commission and our other partners on the matter,"" Rasmussen added, following recent White House talks involving US and Greenlandic officials.In Germany, European Parliament member Manfred Weber warned that Trump’s stance could block progress on the EU–US trade deal agreed last year. ""The EPP is in favour of the EU–US trade deal, but given Donald Trump’s threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,"" Weber said.""The 0% tariffs on US products must be put on hold.""The EU and the US agreed to a preliminary trade deal in July under which most European exports would face a 15% US tax, but talks are still ongoing and the deal’s future is now uncertain amid rising political tensions.","Trump announced a 10% tariff on all goods entering the United States from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland.

IndiGo statement:

EW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has slapped IndiGo with the steepest fine ever for an Indian carrier - Rs 22.2 crore - for its massive flight disruptions last month.Additionally, the airline has to submit a bank guarantee of Rs 50 crore whose release is tied to implementing, among other things, the more humane flight duty norms for pilots aimed to enhancing flight safety. The regulator has warned senior airline officials, including the CEO & COO. The senior VP of operation control centre has to be removed from his position.The senior VP of operation control centre has to be removed from his position and not given any accountable position in the future. The aviation ministry has ordered ""an internal inquiry to identify and implement systemic improvements within DGCA"".The regulator late on Saturday night released key findings of the report by its four-member panel that probed IndiGo schedule collapse last month. The airline's unpreparedness and consequent inability to implement DGCA's new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) for pilots has cost it dear. Each day's exemption given for its Airbus A320 family pilots to ensure the airline was able to start resuming flights staring the second week of Dec is costing it Rs 30 lakh.This works out to Rs 20.4 crore for 68 days between Dec 5, 2025, & Feb 10, 2026.The airline has been fined one-time Rs 30 lakh each on six more counts, which add up the fine to Rs 22.2 crore. The six failures include failure to comply with new FDTL rules, rest periods, ""inadequate buffer margins in roster planning... failure to strike balance between commercial imperatives and crew members' ability to work effectively and failure of accountable management to ensure overall functioning, financing, and conduct of operations to DGCA standards. ""Between Dec 3 and 5, 2,507 IndiGo flights were cancelled and 1,852 were delayed that left over 3 lakh passengers stranded at airports across the airline's network. Flights had resumed gradually over the next week or so.""Over-optimisation of operations, inadequate regulatory preparedness along with deficiencies in system software support and shortcomings in management structure & operational control on the IndiGo"", have been identified as the ""primary causes for the disruption"" by the DGCA probe panel. ""The airline's management failed to adequately identify planning deficiencies, maintain sufficient operational buffer, and effectively implement the revised FDTL provisions,"" the report says.Apart from fines, the airline's CEO has been cautioned ""for inadequate overall oversight of flight ops and crisis management."" Accountable manager & COO, Isidre Porqueras, has been warned for ""failure to assess impact of winter schedule 2025 and revised FDTL leading to widespread disruptions."" Senior VP (ops control centre) has been asked to be relieved from the post and not be given any accountable position in future. Warnings have been issued to flight ops and crew resource planning ""for operational, supervisory, manpower planning and roster management lapses.""DGCA has asked IndiGo to take appropriate action against any other personnel identified through its inquiry and submit a compliance report regarding the same. Sources say IndiGo has been made aware of the lapses of its senior officials, especially COO, and now the airline is expected to take action against them. ""The findings underscore the need for operational planning, and effective management oversight to ensure sustainable operations and passenger safety & convenience,"" report says.Confirming receipt of DGCA ruling, airline said it is ""committed to taking full cognisance of the orders and will, in a thoughtful and timely manner, take appropriate measures... an in-depth review of the robustness and resilience of the internal processes at IndiGo (is) underway to ensure that the airline emerges stronger out of these events in its otherwise pristine record of 19 plus years of operations"".","The regulator has warned senior airline officials, including the CEO & COO.

NEW DELHI: Only seven states — Rajasthan, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Kerala, Assam and Himachal Pradesh — have constituted all seven State Finance Commissions (SFCs) since 1992–93, when Parliament passed two constitutional amendment Acts to institutionalise local govts in urban and rural areas, according to a report published by Janaagraha, a think tank on local governance.This highlights how most state govts have failed to prioritise the institutionalisation of SFCs, which play a crucial role in devolution of finances to municipal and other local bodies. The study on SFCs flagged chronic delays in constituting these commissions, weakening them from inception. In many cases, SFCs were constituted with truncated tenures — sometimes as short as six months — and continued functioning through repeated extensions.In contrast, the Finance Commission (FC) set up by Centre has a fixed two-year term. The report noted that despite being the most predictable source of funding for cities and towns, SFCs remain neglected and unevenly empowered across states.It called for giving SFCs the same standing as. Its recommendations include fixing timelines for constituting SFCs, ensuring adequate staffing and data systems, and requiring state govts to present Action Taken Reports in their assemblies within six months, with clear explanations for accepted or rejected proposals.The report highlighted that transfers from state govts to local bodies, as recommended by SFCs, are, on average, nearly four times larger than those by, making SFCs vital to local govts. This is particularly significant given that most urban local bodies have weak own-source revenues.According to the report, own-source revenues of municipal bodies cover only 60–70% of their recurrent expenditure. They largely depend on state and central grants for capital investment and some operational spending. It also noted that 72% of urban infrastructure is financed by central and state govts.“Scheme funding is typically sector-linked, and its continuity cannot always be guaranteed. In comparison, devolutions recommended byand SFCs are meant to provide predictable, flexible and autonomous funding to meet local needs,” the report said. It added that in many states, SFC grants are the only predictable source of funds for municipal bodies — not just for asset creation but also for payment of staff salaries and operational and maintenance expenses.For instance, in Karnataka, SFC grants accounted for over 75% of total receipts in smaller municipalities and 40–50% in larger cities.","Only seven states have constituted all seven State Finance Commissions (SFCs) since 1992–93.

Trade policy rethink: GTRI calls for tariff overhaul; simpler customs to cut costs and lift exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trade-policy-rethink-gtri-calls-for-tariff-overhaul-simpler-customs-to-cut-costs-and-lift-exports/articleshow/126624152.cms,"ACMA President Says Auto Parts Industry May Face Slowdown In Second Half, Pins Hopes On Trade Deals

India needs a comprehensive overhaul of its import tariff structure and customs administration to reduce trade costs, improve manufacturing competitiveness and revive export growth, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said on Saturday, PTI reported.In a report titled A Blueprint for Modernizing India's Import Tariffs and Customs Regime, GTRI recommended a gradual move towards zero duty on most industrial raw materials and key intermediates, while adopting a low, standard duty of around 5 per cent on finished industrial goods over the next three years.The report also flagged the need to eliminate inverted duty structures, where inputs attract higher tariffs than finished goods, a practice that, it said, quietly erodes domestic manufacturing competitiveness.GTRI said extreme tariff rates, such as the 150 per cent duty on alcohol, should be rationalised, arguing that such levies encourage evasion while yielding negligible fiscal benefits.It added that tariff reform should focus on the total import duty burden, rather than just the headline basic customs duty, noting that importers face a cumulative load of cesses, surcharges and trade remedies that make effective tariffs far more complex than official rate schedules suggest.The report noted that India’s merchandise trade has crossed USD 1.16 trillion, with nearly 29 per cent of GDP flowing through customs clearances, making efficiency critical as global companies reassess sourcing amid geopolitical fragmentation.“India needs a sweeping overhaul of its import tariff structure and customs administration to cut trade costs, strengthen manufacturing competitiveness and revive export growth,” the report said.GTRI pointed out that customs duties now account for just about 6 per cent of gross tax revenue, averaging 3.9 per cent of the value of imports, indicating that tariffs are no longer a major revenue tool.The think tank highlighted that nearly 90 per cent of import value is concentrated in fewer than 10 per cent of tariff lines, while the bottom 60 per cent of tariff lines generate less than 3 per cent of customs revenue, making the current complex tariff schedule inefficient.“Maintaining such a complex tariff structure for limited fiscal return imposes high administrative and compliance costs,” GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said.The report also called for simplifying customs procedures, citing a maze of overlapping notifications that force traders to navigate decades-old amendments, often without clear harmonised system (HS) code references.GTRI urged the government to issue self-contained notifications, publish all applicable import duties in a single unified online schedule, and improve transparency around the renewal of time-bound duty exemptions.To reduce disputes, it recommended aligning India’s duty drawback system with standard eight-digit HS codes, noting that the current separate coding for refunds increases errors and delays.The report further suggested liberalising approval norms for inland container depots and freight stations to support modern supply chains, redeploying customs officers toward audits and origin verification, and posting officers overseas to help exporters address non-tariff barriers.The report was co-authored by former IRS (Customs) officer Satish Reddy.","India needs a comprehensive overhaul of its import tariff structure and customs administration to reduce trade costs, improve manufacturing competitiveness and revive export growth, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.

An evolving path

NEW DELHI: The Budget is not just an economic document or an annual statement of accounts of the central government - it’s the road map that sets the tone and direction of economic reforms and growth. It also signals policy direction to citizens, businesses and investors, shaping confidence and long-term economic outcomes. Over the last few decades, several Union Budgets in India have stood out for being reformist, transformational and path breaking.From Manmohan Singh ’s landmark 1991-92 Budget that opened up the Indian economy and Chidambaram’s ‘Dream Budget’ to Jaswant Singh’s 2003–04 Budget and Nirmala Sitharaman’s new income tax regime measures, we take a look at some Union Budgets that stood out in the last few decades:On February 28, 1983, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee stood before Parliament and announced what he called ""the somewhat unconventional step"" of allocating Rs 300 crore to states based not on population or political negotiation, but on measured performance in implementing specific programmes.""Another Rs 125 crore would be distributed among the States on the basis of their performance in implementing programmes in identified areas of high priority.""Mukherjee told Parliament.The budget documents specified the mechanism: states would receive funding only after demonstrating capacity to achieve targets above those implied in their approved plans. This was outcome-based federalism a decade before the phrase entered policy discourse.Beyond allocation mechanisms, the 1983-84 budget introduced what Mukherjee termed a ""minimum tax"" on corporate profits. His solution was structural. ""I therefore propose to provide that fiscal incentives and concessions shall not absorb more than 70 per cent of the profits. This would secure that companies pay a minimum tax, on at least 30 per cent of their profits."" he said.The 1983-84 budget received limited attention at the time. India was emerging from drought, international attention was focused elsewhere, and the changes appeared technical. But the principles embedded in that budget—performance-based allocation, minimum taxation regardless of incentives, mandatory investment norms for tax-exempt entities—would recur in subsequent reforms.Two years later, V.P. Singh presented a budget that addressed what he termed the ""counter-productive"" nature of India's personal income taxation. In his February 16, 1985 speech, Singh outlined a comprehensive approach to tax reform.The changes were substantial. Singh raised ""the exemption limit for personal income taxation from Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000"" which, he noted, would result in ""around 10 lakh"" assessees being removed from the tax net entirely. He restructured the rate schedule, reducing the number of slabs ""from eight to four.""""The maximum marginal rate of income-tax on personal incomes will stand reduced from 61.875 per cent to 50 per cent,"" Singh announced.On corporate taxation, Singh adopted the minimum tax principle from Mukherjee's earlier budget, noting: ""There are companies which are flourishing, but are paying no tax at all."" But he went further on depreciation policy. Recognizing that ""the internal funds available with the corporate sector are inadequate"" for modernization, he announced: ""I propose to increase the general rate of depreciation in respect of plant and machinery from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. ""For energy efficiency, the approach was more aggressive: ""I propose to go farther and allow 100 per cent depreciation on devices and systems for energy saving.""The budget also began dismantling the industrial licensing system. ""It is proposed to notify a list of industries for delicensing so that procedural delays are cut to a minimum,"" Singh stated.When Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi presented the 1987-88 budget on February 28, 1987, his focus was not merely fiscal but institutional. For education, the commitment was substantial. ""To give a good start to the new Policy, I have allocated as much as Rs 800 crore for education as compared with Rs 352 crore in 1986-87,"" he said. This represented more than a doubling of education expenditure in a single year.This decision led to the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which received statutory powers through legislation in 1992. Prior to SEBI, the Controller of Capital Issues regulated securities markets through the Capital Issues (Control) Act of 1947—a wartime measure designed for a controlled economy, not a liberalising one.Gandhi also announced expansion of the mutual fund industry beyond the monopoly of Unit Trust of India. ""The State Bank of India will set up a Mutual Fund"" to provide investors with additional options, he said. This was the first step toward creating a competitive mutual fund industry.The Union Budget presented on July 24, 1991 marked a decisive break in India’s economic policy, which was later commonly called LPG or Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation. The strategy was framed explicitly as a response to the balance of payment crisis. Addressing Parliament, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh argued that “over centralisation and excessive bureaucratisation of economic processes have proved to be counter productive,” leaving the economy less productive, less competitive, and acutely vulnerable to shock.The scale of the crisis was laid out in blunt terms. “The fiscal deficit of the Central Government… is estimated at more than 8 per cent of GDP in 1990–91,” Singh said, while “external debt… is estimated at 23 per cent of GDP.” Foreign exchange reserves had fallen to “Rs 2500 crores,” sufficient to finance “imports for a mere fortnight.” India, he warned, stood “at the edge of a precipice.”The policy response was structural rather than incremental. Industrial licensing was dismantled across most sectors as the government moved to “bring about a significant measure of deregulation in the domestic sector.” Trade policy shifted “from a regime of quantitative restrictions to a price based mechanism,” reinforced by exchange-rate adjustment and export promotion, while monopoly controls were relaxed to intensify domestic competition.Privatisation and globalisation as they were later referred to followed as complementary pillars of reform. Fundamentally it was about disinvestment and restructuring. Public enterprises were to be refashioned into “an engine of growth rather than an absorber of national savings,” through equity dilution, greater managerial autonomy and clearer accountability.To cushion the social impact of restructuring, Singh announced “a National Renewal Fund, with a substantial corpus,” ensuring that “the cost of technical change and modernisation… does not devolve on the workers.”Foreign investment, long viewed with suspicion, was recast as essential to recovery and competitiveness. India would “welcome, rather than fear, foreign investment,” permitting up to 51 per cent foreign equity in priority industries. The reforms, Singh concluded, were no longer a matter of choice: “no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come”.P. Chidambaram's 1996-97 budget, presented on July 22, 1996, addressed a fundamental structural problem: India's financial system was unable to provide long-term finance for infrastructure projects.""Infrastructure needs long-term finance, typically 15-20 year financial instrument"" Chidambaram stated.The IDFC was designed as ""a direct lender, as a refinancing institution and as a provider of financial guarantees"" to infrastructure projects. This created institutional capacity for long-term infrastructure financing that had not previously existed in India's financial architecture.The budget also strengthened highway development. ""I have decided to provide a sum of Rs 200 crore to strengthen the capital base of the National Highway Authority of India.""On disinvestment, Chidambaram announced the establishment of a Disinvestment Commission. ""Any decision to disinvest will be taken and implemented in a transparent manner. Revenues generated from such disinvestment will be utilised for allocations for education and health and for creating a fund to strengthen public sector enterprises.""P. Chidambaram’s 1997–98 Union Budget, presented on February 28, 1997, came to be known as the “dream budget” for its sweeping tax reforms and its explicit recognition of the information technology revolution. Chidambaram framed his proposals around the logic of the Laffer Curve, arguing that an optimal tax rate exists at which revenue is maximised, and that pushing rates beyond this point reduces collections by discouraging work and investment.On personal income tax, he made a clear break with past practice. “If we look at comparative income-tax slabs in other developing Asian countries, it will be evident that tax rates in India are still high and constitute an important reason for tax evasion,” he said.""I have, therefore, decided to lower the rates of personal income-tax across-the-board in a significant manner. The current rates of 15, 30 and 40 per cent are being replaced by the new rates of 10, 20 and 30 per cent."" Chidambaram announced.On capital markets, Chidambaram introduced five structural reforms to the Companies Act. ""Over 20 million Indians have invested their savings in the capital market. The establishment of the first Depository was an important step taken to bring the Indian capital market upto world standards and to protect the interests of the investors,"" he said.The reforms included introducing the principle of buy-back of shares by companies subject to certain conditions; merging provisions of Sections 370 and 372 of the Companies Act with an overall ceiling of 60 per cent for inter-corporate investment and loans; providing for nomination facilities for holders of securities; requiring companies raising funds from the capital market to give an annual statement disclosing the end-use of such funds; and giving one-time permission to stockbrokers to corporatise their business without attracting tax on capital gains.The budget also announced comprehensive legislative reform. ""I had set up an expert group to draft a new Companies Bill and another expert committee to prepare a new Direct Taxes Bill."" Chidambaram said.Perhaps most significantly for India's future trajectory, Chidambaram explicitly recognized information technology as a transformative force. ""Information Technology has radically altered conventional wisdom on growth strategies. I propose several measures to encourage this industry and to reduce costs,"" he stated.When Yashwant Sinha presented the 1999-2000 budget on February 27, 1999, he signaled a fundamental shift in how the state would manage public sector enterprises. For the first time after Independence, with the enthusiastic support of all political parties in Parliament, it had been possible to discard the long standing tradition of presenting the budget at 5 PM—a break with colonial practice that symbolized the broader reforms to come.""Government's strategy towards public sector enterprises will continue to encompass a judicious mix of strengthening strategic units, privatising non-strategic ones through gradual disinvestment or strategic sale and devising viable rehabilitation strategies for weak units,"" FM Yashwant Sinha said.The disinvestment programme drew primarily upon the recommendations of the Disinvestment Commission, which had submitted eight reports containing recommendations for 43 public sector enterprises. ""In 1999-2000, I propose to raise Rs.10,000 crore through the disinvestment programme. This will help the Government to fund the requirements of social and infrastructure sectors"" he announced.The budget also addressed a fundamental governance challenge. ""The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act has become obsolete in certain areas in the light of international economic developments relating to competition laws.""This recommendation led to the Competition Act of 2002 and the establishment of the Competition Commission of India.On expenditure management, Sinha announced two institutional innovations. ""We will constitute an Expenditure Reforms Commission headed by an eminent and experienced person,"" he stated. He also proposed to initiate a system of zero base budgeting in preparation for the next budget.When Jaswant Singh presented the 2003-04 budget on February 28, 2003, India had recovered from the 1991 crisis but fiscal discipline remained elusive. FM Jaswant Singh's diagnosis was clear: ""Interest payments in 2002-03 are estimated at Rs 1,15,663 crore, equivalent to 48.8 per cent of the Government's revenue receipts.""The solution was to bind future governments through legislation. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, passed in August 2003, set legally enforceable targets to reduce fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, end automatic monetization of the deficit by the Reserve Bank of India, and cap annual government guarantees at 0.5 per cent of GDP.The Act also mandated transparency. Every budget would now include a Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement, a Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, and a Macroeconomic Framework Statement. The government would have to publicly explain deviations from targets.""The Government has nurtured macroeconomic stability—held inflation low, and maintained a strong balance of payments position while promoting growth,"" Singh stated.The one-page tax return was introduced. ""I propose to introduce a one-page only return form for individual tax payers, having income from salary, house property and interest, etc. This has already been devised, and will come into operation from April 1 onwards."" he said.Tax clearance certificates were abolished. ""Henceforth, only expatriates who come to India in connection with business, profession or employment, would have to furnish a guarantee from their employer, etc. in respect of the tax payable before they leave India. An Indian citizen, before leaving India, will only have to give his/her permanent account number.""On search and seizure operations, new protections applied. ""Stocks found during the course of a search and seizure operation will not be seized under any circumstances. Second, no confession shall be obtained during such search and seizure operations. Third, no survey operation will be authorized by an officer below the rank of Joint Commissioner of Income Tax.""On July 8, 2004, P. Chidambaram returned as Finance Minister and introduced a budgetary innovation that would be replicated across multiple sectors: earmarked taxation.""I propose to levy an education cess of 2% on the aggregate of all Central government taxes,"" Chidambaram stated.The cess was not additional spending—education allocations continued from the general budget. Rather, it created visible linkage between taxation and social investment. Citizens paying income tax, corporations paying corporate tax, importers paying customs duty—all would see 2 per cent of their tax bill designated specifically for education.The innovation was transparency. Unlike general taxation where revenues disappeared into the Consolidated Fund, earmarked cesses made the social contract visible: you pay this specific amount, it funds that specific purpose.The budgets presented by Pranab Mukherjee between 2009 and 2012 coincided with the rollout of digital identity infrastructure that would transform benefit delivery.In his 2009-10 budget, presented in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Mukherjee stated: ""The challenge before us is to revive the economy without compromising medium-term fiscal sustainability.""Budget documents during this period referenced the Unique Identification Authority of India, established in January 2009 through executive order. The UIDAI was mandated to issue unique identification numbers—Aadhaar—to all residents.Subsequent Mukherjee budgets referred to pilot programs for Aadhaar-based beneficiary identification and direct benefit transfers. Though not fully implemented during his tenure, the budgetary provisions and pilot programs laid groundwork for the JAM trinity that would later enable direct benefit transfers at scale.Arun Jaitley's February 1, 2017 budget came months before the July 1, 2017 rollout of the Goods and Services Tax—India's most complex tax reform since independence.""The GST Council has held nine meetings and taken decisions on the basis of consensus,"" Jaitley stated.The GST replaced 17 central and state indirect taxes with a unified framework. But the institutional innovation was the GST Council itself—a constitutional body comprising the Union Finance Minister, Union Minister of State for Revenue, and Finance Ministers of all states.The Council operated on consensus. Each state had one vote; the Centre had one-third of total votes. Decisions required three-fourths majority. This forced negotiation, compromise, and federal cooperation on tax rates, exemptions, thresholds, and compliance procedures.For the first time in Indian fiscal history, tax policy for a major revenue source was made not by the Union government alone, not by Parliament alone, but by a federal body requiring agreement between Centre and states.The Union Budget for 2020-21 was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2020. In her speech, Sitharaman referred to the National Infrastructure Pipeline, which identified infrastructure projects across sectors over a multi-year horizon.A Project Preparation Facility was announced to support the appraisal and design of infrastructure projects. The budget documents referred to the involvement of technical and professional expertise in project preparation. The formulation of a National Logistics Policy was also referred to, with the objective of clarifying roles across ministries and reducing duplication.“In continuation of the reform measures already taken so far, the tax proposals in this budget will introduce further reforms to stimulate growth, simplify tax structure, bring ease of compliance, and reduce litigations” she said.The budget increased capital expenditure and outlined plans for asset monetisation through a structured pipeline. The National Monetisation Pipeline was referred to in the budget documents as a mechanism for leasing public assets.But the 2020-21 budget's most consequential institutional reform was in personal income taxation. Sitharaman announced a fundamental restructuring of the tax regime itself.The Union Budget for 2025-26 was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The budget referred to Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0, which proposed the decriminalisation of specified provisions across multiple laws. The objective, as stated in the budget documents, was to reduce compliance burden and improve ease of doing business.Under the new tax regime, the Finance Minister said no income tax will be payable on incomes up to Rs 12 lakh, excluding income taxed at special rates, with the limit rising to Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers after the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.A high-level committee was announced to review non-financial sector regulations, licences, and permissions. The budget proposed the introduction of a new Income Tax Bill. ""The new bill will be clear and direct in text so as to make it simple to understand for taxpayers and tax administration,"" Sitharaman stated.Thresholds for tax deduction at source and tax collection at source were revised. The budget also announced revisions to thresholds for certain categories of taxpayers, including senior citizens and small enterprises.Four decades separate Mukherjee's performance-based grants from Sitharaman's compliance rationalisation. Yet the trajectory is consistent: budgets have served as instruments of institutional adaptation, responding to the evolving challenges of the Indian state.India's budgetary reforms have not followed a predetermined blueprint. They have emerged from negotiation between continuity and change—preserving the state's redistributive role while dismantling mechanisms that stifled growth.What remains unresolved is whether these frameworks can keep pace with emerging challenges. Digital taxation, climate financing, and the fiscal implications of changing demography require a budget as an anchor of reform and evolution. The budget, once again, may need to serve as more than an accounting exercise.","The Budget is not just an economic document or an annual statement of accounts of the central government. It’s the road map that sets the tone and direction of economic reforms and growth. It also signals policy direction to citizens, businesses and investors. Over the last few decades, several Union Budgets in India have stood out for being reformist, transformational and path breaking.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126620895,imgsize-663350,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"Lashing out at Europe, Trump announces 'Greenland tariffs'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lashing-out-at-europe-trump-announces-greenland-tariffs/articleshow/126623290.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

‘Be Ready To Pay…’: Trump SHOCKS NATO Allies With New Tariff Warning To Acquire Greenland

Add “Greenland tariffs” to Russian oil tariffs, BRICS tariffs, Iran tariffs, Liberation Day tariffs etc. Declaring himself “Tariff King,” US President Donald Trump escalated the idea of taxing the world’s imports to “Make America Great Again” imposing 10 per cent tariffs on eight European countries — including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland— to force them to cede Greenland to the US.Effective February 1, 2026, the US would impose 10% tariffs on the eight European countries ""until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Sunday, evidently irked by some of them sending troops to Greenland to support Denmark. If a deal was not struck by June 1, the tariff will be increased to 25 percent, he added.Trump claimed that the United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years, and “many Presidents have tried, and for good reason, but Denmark has always refused.” Now, because of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important, he said. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are currently being spent on Security Programs having to do with “The Dome,” including for the possible protection of Canada, and “this very brilliant, but highly complex system can only work at its maximum potential and efficiency, because of angles, metes, and bounds, if this Land is included in it,” Trump added.The US President also accused the countries sending their military to Greenland of playing a very “dangerous game,” putting “a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.” Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question, he said.Denmark and Greenland have refuted Trump’s charge that the Arctic is overrun by Russian and Chinese vessels and the two countries are out to grab the territory.The latest tariff announcement comes at a fraught moment for transatlantic relations. European governments have publicly rejected the idea of selling Greenland, asserting that decisions about the territory are strictly a matter for Denmark and Greenlandic authorities. European Union and Nato officials have warned that invoking tariffs against allies over territorial political disputes could undermine the foundation of the post–World War II security architecture.Trump’s announcement revived broader elements of his aggressive tariff strategy first rolled out in 2025. During that earlier phase, he promulgated sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on more than 180 countries, including a baseline 10 percent rate on many trading partners and higher rates on China and the EU, claiming the measures would correct trade imbalances. The roster of affected nations has included Canada, Japan, South Korea, India, and others, with rates ranging from 10 percent up to nearly 50 percent under Trump’s rhetoric.Trump has repeatedly referred to himself, in social media posts and campaign rhetoric, as the “tariff king,” underscoring his belief that tariffs are both a political tool and an economic weapon. In past engagements, he has threatened punitive duties on China, the European Union, Mexico, and other major economies, often in blunt and transactional language that bypasses traditional diplomatic channels.But the recent tariff gambit has drawn intense bipartisan scrutiny at home. Even within Republican circles, unease is growing over the breadth and implications of Trump’s tariff policy. A group of GOP seNators has introduced legislation—the Trade Review Act of 2025—to rein in executive authority on tariffs and restore congressional oversight, a clear signal of mounting institutional pushback.In MAGA-aligned spheres, reactions have been mixed. Some hard-line supporters laud Trump’s confrontational posture toward allies perceived as freeloading on US. security commitments, arguing that “America must be strong and assertive.” But other prominent conservatives and business voices warn that tariffs risk inflationary pressures, disrupted supply chains, and retaliation, potentially harming US. exporters and farmers. Analysts have also pointed to global market volatility sparked by earlier rounds of Trump’s tariffs.Diplomatically, the implications are profound. Nato, long grounded in shared security interests, now faces stress not solely from external threats but from internal discord. Europe’s anger over punitive duties could erode political trust, complicate burden-sharing discussions, and fuel narratives of a fracturing alliance at a moment of Russian and Chinese assertiveness. Canada, a founding member of Nato, has already made tracks towards Beijing.","US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 10 per cent tariffs on eight European countries to force them to cede Greenland to the US.

The European Union and the Mercosur on Saturday formally signed a long-awaited free trade agreement, closing more than 25 years of negotiations and creating one of the world’s largest integrated trading zones.The agreement was signed in Asunción, marking a significant geopolitical win for the EU at a time of intensifying global trade frictions, rising tariffs and expanding Chinese exports. The pact also signals South America’s intent to maintain diversified economic and diplomatic ties, even as the United States sharpens its trade posture in the Western Hemisphere.The deal brings together a combined market of over 700 million people, accounting for roughly a quarter of global gross domestic product. It aims to progressively reduce tariffs on a vast majority of goods traded between the two blocs, opening new opportunities for South American agricultural exporters and European manufacturers seeking access to fast-growing markets.Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ursula von der Leyen said the agreement carried major strategic weight at a time when free trade is increasingly under pressure.“The geopolitical importance of this agreement cannot be overstated,” von der Leyen said, adding, “We choose fair trade over tariffs.We choose a productive long-term partnership over isolation.”She said the pact reflects a shared belief that deeper cooperation is the best way to generate growth and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.The ceremony was attended by the presidents of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, along with Brazil’s foreign minister, representing Mercosur’s largest economy.For the EU, the agreement strengthens its footprint in a resource-rich region that has become a focal point of competition between Washington and Beijing. For Mercosur members, the deal promises expanded access to European markets for agricultural products, while reinforcing their position as global trade partners beyond any single power centre.The accord still faces ratification processes within individual EU member states and Mercosur countries, but Saturday’s signing marks the most decisive step yet toward reshaping trade relations between Europe and South America in an increasingly fragmented global economy.","The European Union and the Mercosur on Saturday formally signed a long-awaited free trade agreement.

Public pushback in Greenland



Greenland for national security, insist Trump



US President Donald Trump threatened multiple European countries with 10% tariff as he escalated his bid to take control of Greenland. The 47th POTUS said that starting February 1, eight European countries will face a 10% levy on goods sent to the US.In a lengthy statement posted on social media, Trump accused Denmark and other European nations of benefiting for decades from US protection without adequate “remuneration” and framed the Greenland issue as a matter of global security. He said the US had “subsidised Denmark, and all of the countries of the European Union, and others, for many years by not charging them tariffs”, adding that “now, after centuries, it is time for Denmark to give back”.Trump claimed that Greenland had become strategically vulnerable, asserting that “China and Russia want Greenland” and that Denmark was incapable of defending the territory. He said only the United States could guarantee its security, linking the island’s importance to US national defence and what he described as “world peace”.According to the statement, countries named for the proposed tariffs include Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland.Trump said these nations had “journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”, calling the situation “very dangerous for the safety, security, and survival of our planet”.He said the tariffs would remain in place “until such time as a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland”, adding that the US had sought to acquire the territory for more than 150 years but had been repeatedly rebuffed by Denmark.Trump also tied the demand to US missile defence ambitions, referring to the “Golden Dome” and modern weapons systems. He said hundreds of billions of dollars were being spent on security programmes linked to the project, including potential protection for Canada, and argued that the system could operate at “maximum potential and efficiency” only if Greenland were included.“The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these countries,” Trump said, warning that strong measures were necessary to ensure the situation ended “quickly, and without question”.As Washington’s rhetoric sharpens, resistance is building on the ground in Greenland.Earlier on Saturday, hundreds of people in Greenland’s capital Nuuk braved near-freezing temperatures, rain and icy streets to march in support of self-governance, rejecting any suggestion of an American takeover. Protesters waved Greenland’s red-and-white national flags, sang traditional songs and walked through Nuuk’s small downtown carrying placards reading “We shape our future,” “Greenland is not for sale” and “Greenland is already GREAT”.Similar rallies were reported across the wider Kingdom of Denmark, underscoring unease within the Danish realm over renewed US claims on Greenland.The demonstrations came just hours after a bipartisan US congressional delegation met officials in Copenhagen to reassure Denmark and Greenland of continued American support. The delegation was led by Chris Coons, who acknowledged that the current rhetoric around Greenland had caused anxiety across the Danish kingdom.“I hope that the people of the Kingdom of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people,” Coons said, adding that the US respects Denmark and Nato “for all we’ve done together”. He said his aim was to de-escalate tensions at a moment when political statements from Washington were fuelling uncertainty in Greenland and among US allies in Europe.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued that Washington should gain control of Greenland, the self-governing territory under Denmark, a Nato ally. Earlier this week, he said any outcome short of US control of the Arctic island would be “unacceptable.”On Friday, while speaking at the White House during an event unrelated to foreign policy and focused on rural healthcare, Trump referred to past instances where he had warned European partners of possible tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.Linking that approach to Greenland, Trump said, “I may do that for Greenland, too,” ahead of his targeted tariff announcement on Saturday. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security.”","US President Donald Trump threatened multiple European countries with 10% tariff as he escalated his bid to take control of Greenland.

Strategic diversification underway



Gold buying gathers pace



China has pushed its holdings of US government debt down to their lowest level in nearly two decades, underscoring a steady recalibration of its foreign exchange reserves away from dollar assets and towards gold and overseas investments amid strained ties with Washington, PTI reported.Data released by the US Department of the Treasury shows that China’s holdings of US Treasuries fell to $682.6 billion in November, down from $688.7 billion in October, marking the lowest level since 2008.The reduction comes even as overall foreign ownership of US debt touched a record high, with key allies stepping in. Japan raised its holdings by $2.6 billion to $1.2 trillion, while the UK increased its exposure by $10.6 billion to $888.5 billion, according to the same data.Analysts say Beijing’s continued trimming of US debt reflects a broader strategy to diversify reserve assets amid concerns over geopolitical risk and the long-term sustainability of American public debt.China currently holds the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves, totalling $3.3579 trillion at the end of December 2025, official media reported.“The decrease in China's holdings of the US treasuries is a result of increased optimisation and diversification of holdings of foreign assets seen in recent years, which helps strengthen the overall safety and stability of the portfolio,” Xi Junyang, professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the state-run Global Times.Shao Yu, chief economist at the Sci-tech Innovation Management Research Centre at Fudan University, said Beijing appeared determined to further reduce exposure to US debt as fiscal risks mount.“The massive accumulation of debt resembles a Ponzi scheme, where larger volumes of new debt are used to replace the old. China doesn’t want to play this game anymore,” he told the South China Morning Post.Alongside the drawdown in US Treasuries, China has been steadily boosting its gold reserves, reinforcing gold’s role as a hedge against external shocks.Latest figures from the People's Bank of China show that the country’s gold reserves rose to 74.15 million ounces by the end of December 2025, up 30,000 ounces from the previous month. This marked the 14th consecutive month of gold accumulation by the central bank.Xi Junyang said the central bank is likely to continue increasing gold holdings as part of efforts to strengthen reserve stability and improve resilience against global volatility, noting that gold still forms a relatively smaller share of China’s reserves compared with other major economies.","China's holdings of US Treasuries fell to $682.6 billion in November, down from $688.7 billion in October.

Allies look beyond US market



Why Canada pivoted to Beijing



USMCA risks loom large



US President Donald Trump’s aggressive and unpredictable tariff strategy is beginning to redraw global trade alignments, with long-standing US partners actively seeking alternatives — and China emerging as a key beneficiary.Canada delivered the clearest signal yet of this shift on Friday, cutting its 100% import tax on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for sharply lower Chinese tariffs on Canadian farm exports, especially canola seeds. The move marks a striking departure from Ottawa’s earlier alignment with Washington on China trade.“It’s a huge declaration of realignment in Canada’s economic relations,” said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “The economic threat from the United States is now perceived by Canadians as far bigger than the economic threat from China. So this is a big deal.’’Canada is not alone. As Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every country — alongside targeted levies on sectors such as steel and automobiles — major economies are accelerating efforts to reduce dependence on the US market.The European Union is expected to formally sign a trade pact with the Mercosur bloc, comprising Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia, while also pursuing a trade agreement with India.China, hit by US tariffs since Trump’s first term, has quietly diversified exports toward Europe and Southeast Asia.That strategy appears to be paying off. Despite a sharp fall in exports to the US, China reported a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus with the rest of the world in 2025, according to official data released this week.Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has overturned decades of US trade policy by imposing double-digit tariffs on imports from almost all countries. He argues the measures will raise revenue, protect domestic industries and force manufacturing back to the US.Yet the application of tariffs has often appeared arbitrary. Trump has threatened countries over political disputes — including Brazil over the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro — and on Friday warned of tariffs against nations opposing his push to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark.Canada’s agreement with China represents a reversal of its 2024 decision to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, mirroring US concerns that low-cost Chinese vehicles could swamp North American automakers.The economic logic, however, is compelling. China cut tariffs on Canadian canola from 84% to 15%, a major relief for farmers who rely heavily on export markets.At the same time, Trump’s retreat from green-energy priorities has altered calculations in Ottawa. “The Trump administration, favoring fossil fuels over green energy, is actively hostile to EV production in North America,” said economist Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“China’s strengths in electric vehicle sector are undeniable,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday. “China produces some of the most affordable and efficient energy efficient vehicles in the world… to build our own competitive EV sector, we need to learn from innovative partners.”Still, the shift is politically risky. Relations between Ottawa and Beijing have been strained since 2018, when China detained two Canadians after Canada arrested a Huawei executive at Washington’s request. Domestic opposition has also surfaced, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford warning the deal could hurt Canadian autoworkers.“Make no mistake: China now has a foothold in the Canadian market and will use it to their full advantage at the expense of Canadian workers,” Ford said in a social media post.Carney countered that the deal is limited, allowing China to export 49,000 EVs at a reduced tariff initially, rising to about 70,000 in five years.The biggest uncertainty lies south of the border. The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) comes up for renewal this year, and Trump is expected to demand changes to shift manufacturing to the US — or potentially threaten withdrawal altogether.Canada sends 75% of its goods exports to the United States, making any rupture economically perilous.“This will make the talks more complicated,” said William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Trump will not be pleased… and will certainly make it an issue in the USMCA talks.’’Trump struck a conciliatory note on Friday, saying: “If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.” Carney, for his part, noted the agreement with Beijing is preliminary, leaving room for adjustments if tensions escalate.For now, analysts say the message is unmistakable. “It sends a big signal that Canada is looking to other partners and has options,” Lovely said, “and would rather walk away from USMCA than make humiliating compromises that serve only American interests.”",Canada cuts its 100% import tax on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for sharply lower Chinese tariffs on Canadian farm exports.

Pulse trade: US senators write to Trump; urge better access to Indian market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pulse-trade-us-senators-write-to-trump-urge-better-access-to-indian-market/articleshow/126605889.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image)

US Threatens 25% Tariff on India-Iran Trade, Indian Rice Exporters Warn of Losses

Two Republican lawmakers have urged US President Donald Trump to press for better access for American pulse crop producers in the Indian market as part of ongoing trade negotiations between Washington and New Delhi.In a letter dated January 16, Senators Steve Daines of Montana and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota called on Trump to include “favourable pulse crop provisions” in any future bilateral trade agreement with India.Both states are among the largest producers of pulse crops such as peas, lentils and dried beans in the US. India is the world’s biggest consumer of these commodities.The lawmakers said American farmers have long been concerned about India’s high agricultural tariffs, which they argue raise costs and make US pulse exports less competitive compared with other suppliers. They observed that India accounts for about 27 per cent of global pulse consumption, with lentils, chickpeas, dried beans and peas among the most commonly consumed varieties, according to PTI.They also pointed to India’s decision to impose a 30 per cent tariff on yellow peas, announced on October 30 last year and effective from November 1, 2025.“As a result of the unfair Indian tariffs, US pulse crop producers face a significant competitive disadvantage when exporting their high-quality product to India,” the letter read.According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), India’s average applied tariff on agricultural products stands at 39 per cent, compared with an average of 5 per cent in the US.USTR has also flagged technical barriers to trade, regulatory hurdles and market access restrictions in sectors including agriculture, which it said have reduced US exports to India.The appeal comes amid broader efforts by Washington and New Delhi to finalise a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor has said the two sides are actively engaged in concluding a new deal. The Trump administration launched negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement with India on February 13 last year and in April the USTR finalised its Terms of Reference, laying the groundwork for multi-sector negotiations.Daines and Cramer argued that lowering trade barriers would benefit both American producers and Indian consumers, given India’s large demand for protein-rich pulses. They said engaging Prime Minister Narendra Modi on pulse crop tariffs would be “mutually beneficial” for both countries.Thanking Trump for his efforts to support agricultural producers in North Dakota and Montana, the lawmakers said they encouraged him to pursue favourable provisions for pulse crops as negotiations move forward.They also recalled raising similar concerns during Trump’s first term, ahead of the 2020 trade talks with India. The senators said the President had “hand-delivered” their earlier letter to PM Modi, which they said helped bring US producers into the negotiations.“As the United States looks to rebalance trade disparities, American farmers are ready to help fill the gap. They have tremendous capacity to feed and fuel the world if trade opportunities are unleashed,” the lawmakers said.In their 2020 letter, written ahead of President Trump’s visit to India, the senators called Indian tariffs on pulse crops ""unfair"" and had significantly harmed US producers. This comes after India was removed from the Generalised System of Preferences in June 2019, leading to additional duties on American exports.","Senators Steve Daines of Montana and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota called on Trump to include ‘favourable pulse crop provisions’ in any future bilateral trade agreement with India.

'China Superpower, Reliable': Carney DUMPS Trump For Xi, Then Gives TARIFF SHOCK To U.S.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced a new trade agreement with China.Carney said that the deal would open markets for Canadian businesses and workers.In a post on social media platform X, Carney said, ""We've secured a new trade agreement with China -- unlocking more than $7 billion in export markets for Canadian workers and businesses. ""In a statement by the Canadian Prime Minister's Office said, ""In a more divided and uncertain world, Canada is building a stronger, more independent, and more resilient economy. To that end, Canada's new government is working with urgency and determination to diversify trade partnerships and catalyse massive new levels of investment. As the world's second-largest economy, China presents enormous opportunities for Canada in this mission. ""To forge a new Canada-China partnership, Carney, visited Beijing this week. This marked the first visit to China by a Canadian Prime Minister since 2017. In Beijing, Prime Minister Carney met with the President of China, Xi Jinping , the Premier of China, Li Qiang, and the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Zhao Leji. After their meeting, Prime Minister Carney and President Xi released a joint statement outlining the pillars of Canada and China's new strategic partnership.Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, CBS News reported.Carney said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, as per CBS News.Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the US.""Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,"" Carney said, as quoted by CBS News.Canada faces 35% levy on its goods. Canada is affected by the blanket 50% levy on imported metals and 25% on non-US automobiles.Meanwhile, China and US arm-twisted each other with threats of 100% tariffs but after US President Donald Trump and Xi Jinping's meeting, the tariffs were exempted on a portion of Chinese products until November 10, 2026.","Carney said that the deal would open markets for Canadian businesses and workers.

Donald Trump Attacks $72B Netflix–WBD Deal, Demands CNN Be ‘Sold Or Included’ In Mega Merger

US President Donald Trump purchased around $100 million in municipal and corporate bonds between mid-November and late December, his latest financial disclosures showed. The investments included up to $2 million in Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery bonds bought shortly after the companies announced their merger.The disclosures, posted Thursday and Friday, showed that most of Trump’s purchases were municipal bonds issued by cities, local school districts, utilities and hospitals. He also acquired corporate bonds from major companies such as Boeing, Occidental Petroleum and General Motors.These investments add to Trump’s expanding portfolio while in office, which includes holdings in sectors that could benefit from his policies, prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest.For instance, Trump said in December that he would have a say in whether Netflix can proceed with its proposed $83 billion acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery, which faces competition from Paramount Skydance. Any deal will require regulatory approval.A White House official said on Friday that Trump’s stock and bond portfolio is independently managed by third-party financial institutions. The official added that neither Trump nor his family members have the ability to direct, influence or provide input on how the portfolio is invested, according to Reuters.Like many wealthy individuals, Trump regularly invests in bonds. He had previously disclosed at least $82 million in bond purchases between late August and early October.","US President Donald Trump purchased around $100 million in municipal and corporate bonds between mid-November and late December.

Around 53 per cent of World Economic Forum chief economists who were surveyed expect global economic conditions to weaken in the year ahead, down from 72 per cent in September 2025, even as they acknowledge the relative resilience of the global economy amid turbulence.The global economic outlook has improved modestly but remains uncertain, with asset valuations, mounting debt, geoeconomic realignment and rapid artificial intelligence deployment creating both opportunities and risks, according to the World Economic Forum's latest Chief Economists' Outlook, published on January 16.Although 53 per cent of chief economists expect global economic conditions to weaken in the year ahead, this marks a significant improvement from the 72 per cent who held this view in September 2025.Uncertainty around technology remains high, with 52 per cent expecting AI-related stocks to decline and 40 per cent expecting gains.When it comes to the potential expected returns from AI, there is wide variation across regions and sectors. Roughly four in five chief economists expect productivity gains within two years in the US and China. Chief economists expect the information technology sector to adopt AI fastest, with nearly three-quarters anticipating imminent productivity gains.Financial services, supply chain, healthcare, engineering and retail follow as ""fast-movers"", with one to two-year timelines.On growth, expectations diverge by region, with economists expecting strong momentum in South Asia and East Asia and weak to moderate growth in Europe.On macroeconomics, nearly a third of respondents are concerned about sovereign debt crises in advanced economies and nearly half in emerging economies; over 60 per cent expect governments to rely on higher inflation and tax revenues to manage elevated debt.""The Chief Economists survey reveals three defining trends for 2026: surging AI investment and its implications for the global economy; debt approaching critical thresholds with unprecedented shifts in fiscal and monetary policies; and trade realignments,"" said Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director, World Economic Forum.""Governments and companies will have to navigate an uncertain near-term environment with agility while continuing to build resilience and invest in the long-term fundamentals of growth,"" Saadia Zahidi added.Global trade and investment are adjusting to a new, competitive reality.Chief economists expect import tariffs between the US and China to remain mostly stable, though competition could intensify in other domains. Some 91 per cent expect US tech export restrictions to China to remain or increase; 84 per cent anticipate the same for Chinese critical mineral restrictions.In this new context, 94 per cent of chief economists expect more bilateral trade deals and 69 per cent anticipate growth in regional trade agreements.The World Economic Forum's 56th Annual Meeting, taking place on 19-23 January 2026 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, will convene leaders from business, government, international organizations, civil society and academia under the theme, A Spirit of Dialogue.","53% of chief economists expect global economic conditions to weaken in the year ahead.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell To Face Jail? Trump DOJ In Action | Karoline's Shock Update Amid Big Clash

President Donald Trump on Friday said he would like to keep his top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, at the White House rather than potentially nominate him to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve.""I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump said at a White House event, when he saw Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, in the audience. ""I just want to thank you, you were fantastic on television the other day.""Trump's comments, while not clearly definitive, have upended expectations around the extensive search the White House has undergone to find a new Fed chair, one of the most powerful financial positions in the world. The president's remarks have boosted the prospects for Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and already a top contender for the position.Hassett has generally been seen as the front-runner in the race to replace Powell because he has worked for Trump since his first presidential term. Last month, Trump referred to Hassett as a ""potential Fed chair.""Powell's term as chair will end May 15, though he could take the unusual step of remaining on the board as governor afterward.Trump appointed Powell in 2018 but soon soured on him for raising the Fed's key interest rate that year.Warsh's candidacy has also likely been boosted by the Justice Department's subpoenas of the Federal Reserve last week, revealed Sunday in an unusually direct video statement by Powell. The Fed chair charged that the subpoenas were essentially punishment for the central bank's refusal to lower interest rates as sharply as Trump would like.The criminal investigation - a first for a sitting Fed chair - sparked pushback on Capitol Hill, with many Republican senators dismissing the idea that Powell could have committed a crime. The subpoenas related to testimony Powell gave last June before the Senate Banking Committee that touched on a $2.5 billion building renovation project.The backlash has intensified concerns in the Senate, analysts say, that the Trump administration is seeking to undermine the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics. That, in turn, may reduce Hassett's prospects.The brouhaha over the subpoenas is ""making it harder to confirm Hassett, who is distinctively close to the president,"" Krishna Guha, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote in a client note. ""Warsh is trusted by Senate Republicans and would be much easier to confirm.""Yet Warsh, historically, is known as a ""hawk,"" or someone who traditionally supports higher interest rates to ward off inflation, as opposed to a ""dove,"" or someone who prefers lower borrowing costs to spur hiring and growth.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose Friday, to just above 4.2%, from about 4.17% Thursday. The increase likely reflected a sense that Warsh's chances had improved, and as a result the Fed would be less likely over time to cut rates than under a Hassett chairmanship.","President Donald Trump said he would like to keep his top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, at the White House.

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday celebrated the expected signing of the free trade agreement between the EU and four South American countries the following day at a ceremony that Lula will not attend.This is the first major trade agreement for Mercosur, which includes the region's two biggest economies, Brazil and Argentina, along with Paraguay and Uruguay. The two blocs are expected to formally sign their quarter-century-in-the-making trade pact this Saturday at a ceremony in Paraguay. Bolivia, the newest Mercosur member, was not involved in negotiations but can join the agreement in the coming years.While local media reported that Argentina's Javier Milei and Uruguay's Yamandu Orsi will be present at the ceremony hosted by Paraguay's Santiago Pena, Lula decided not to make the trip to the capital Asuncion.Instead, the Brazilian leader will be represented by Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira.That caused some surprise, in light of Lula's energetic efforts in favor of the deal, particularly since returning to Brazil's presidency in 2023 for a third, nonconsecutive term.Lula's December disappointment Experts say the move may hint at Lula's disappointment the deal was not signed in December, when Brazil had the rotating presidency of Mercosur.In Rio, Lula again pointed to how long the negotiations had taken.""It was more than 25 years of suffering and attempts to get a deal,"" Lula said during a short statement to the press at Itamaraty Palace in downtown Rio alongside von der Leyen.But he hailed the historic nature of the pact.""Tomorrow in Asuncion, we will make history by creating one of the world's largest free trade areas, bringing together some 720 million people and a GDP of over $22 trillion,"" he said.The European Commission's president paid warm tribute to Lula for his efforts in making the deal happen.""The political leadership, the personal commitment and passion that you have shown in the last weeks and months, dear Lula, are truly second to none,"" said von der Leyen.At a late press conference in Copacabana on Friday, European Council President Antonio Costa also said that the latest Brazilian presidency of Mercosur was crucial to advance negotiations, paving the way to its signature in Paraguay.""Power of friendship"" The significance of creating one of the world's largest free-trade zones while U.S. President Donald Trump yanks the United States out of the international economy is not lost on the signatories.""This is the power of partnership and openness. This is the power of friendship and understanding between peoples and regions across oceans,"" von der Leyen said. ""And this is how we create real prosperity - prosperity that is shared. Because, we agree, that international trade is not a zero-sum game.""The victory for the EU and Mercosur comes at the expense of the U.S. and China, experts say, as Trump aggressively asserts American authority in the resource-rich region and Beijing uses its massive trade and loans to build influence.The accord grants South American nations, renowned for their fertile land and skilled farmers, increased access at a preferential tax rate to Europe's vast market for agricultural goods.Apex, a Brazilian government investment agency, estimates that EU-bound agricultural exports like instant coffee, poultry and orange juice will rake in $7 billion in coming years.But Lula on Friday warned that Mercosur would not limit itself to the ""eternal role"" of commodity exporters. ""We want to produce and sell industrial goods with higher added value,"" he said.Flavia Loss, an international relations professor at Foundation School of Sociology and Politics in Sao Paulo, said that Lula's absence on Saturday may be retaliation for the delay - another sign that Brazil and Mercosur are seeking equal terms with the EU.""I see Lula's absence as signaling: 'The deal is important but we're not going to change everything for them,'"" Loss said.Rebuke of MAGA logic While the deal is asymmetrical and economically favorable to the European Union, politically the agreement is beneficial for both parties, said Roberto Goulart Menezes, an international relations professor at the University of Brasilia.For the European Union, which is under pressure amid Trump's threats to seize control of Greenland, the deal shows that the group of countries is betting on the diversification of its partners and multilateralism, Goulart said, in a symbolic rebuke of Trump's MAGA logic.""And for Mercosur, it illustrates that the bloc is relevant, despite accusations of being insignificant and on its last legs.""Speaking to journalists, Costa addressed criticisms that the deal favors the EU. ""It's a trade deal, but it's also an investment agreement. (...) Because our policy is not, unlike the Chinese approach, to simply arrive and extract the minerals so that the added value is generated elsewhere.""""There is no longer that post-colonial logic of going around extracting natural resources,"" he said.","Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen celebrate the expected signing of the free trade agreement.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

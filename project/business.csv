Silver delivered a glittering rally on Monday, scaling a life time high, lifted by strong demand for the precious metal and global rally. Silver futures touched record high of Rs 2,14,534 per kilogram on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) in what is being seen as one of its strongest annual performances in recent years. Spot silver also gained 2.2% hitting a record high of $68.65 per ounce.With just two weeks remaining in 2025, market participants are closely tracking the momentum, as analysts increasingly see the Rs 2,25,000 level as a realistic target before the year ends.According to Jigar Trivedi, senior research analyst at Reliance Securities, the rally is being supported by “strong central bank buying and sustained ETF inflows”. He added that gold prices also rose to a record $4,380 per ounce on Monday, fuelled by expectations of further US interest rate cuts and rising geopolitical tensions, which have provided additional support to silver prices. Trivedi further told ET that the white metal could continue to gain on global cues and pegged the year-end target at Rs 2,25,000.Tata Mutual Fund, reffering to silver's momentum, said, “prices have surged to record highs in international markets, driven by a physical metal shortage, booming solar industry demand, strong Indian imports, and sustained inflows into silver ETFs”.The expert further told ET that supply disruptions are playing a major role behind the rally. The white metal recently received the designation of “critical mineral”, from the US. At the same time, China—one of the largest silver exporters—imposed export restrictions, further pressurising the global supply chain.Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said that silver continues to outperform within the precious metals segment, noting that COMEX silver has also surged to register fresh all-time highs. “Silver’s strength is being driven by rising industrial demand from solar power, electric vehicles, and electronics, combined with persistent global supply deficits,” Ponmudi said.He added that investor participation has picked up, with silver offering leveraged exposure to the broader precious metals cycle.","Silver futures touched record high of Rs 2,14,534 per kilogram on the Multi- Commodity Exchange (MCX) Spot silver also gained 2.2% hitting a record highs of $68.65 per ounce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126117632,imgsize-61114,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Zero Tariff Access For Indian Exports As Modi Govt Seals Landmark Free Trade Deal With New Zealand

India-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA): Top Points To Know

In a major boost for India, once the FTA is in place, Indian exports to New Zealand will get zero-duty access, with tariff elimination across all tariff lines. The pact is expected to benefit farmers, MSMEs, workers, artisans, women-led enterprises and youth, while creating new opportunities for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, apparel, leather and footwear.

Manufacturing-oriented sectors including engineering, automobiles, electronics, machinery, plastics, pharmaceuticals and chemicals are also set to gain from the agreement, which aims to deepen trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.

The trade deal aims to expand cooperation in services, mobility, goods, investment and trade facilitation, with the aim of doubling bilateral trade over the next five years.

As part of the deal, New Zealand has committed to investing $20 billion in India over a 15 year period, following a framework similar to the European Free Trade Association model. The proposed investments are expected to target manufacturing, infrastructure, services, innovation and job creation, providing a significant boost to India’s investment landscape.

The agreement also places strong emphasis on agriculture. Indian farmers are expected to gain improved access to New Zealand’s market for products such as fruits, vegetables, coffee, spices, cereals and processed foods.

Through initiatives such as the Agricultural Productivity Partnership, Centres of Excellence and access to New Zealand’s advanced agricultural technologies, farmers are expected to benefit from higher productivity, improved quality and increased incomes. Targeted measures for horticultural products including honey, kiwifruit and apples are aimed at supporting sustainable growth in the sector.

At the same time, India has protected sensitive domestic sectors under the agreement. Agriculture and allied products including dairy, sugar, coffee, spices, edible oils, precious metals such as gold and silver, precious-metal scrap, copper cathodes and rubber-based products have been safeguarded to protect farmers, MSMEs and domestic industries.

The FTA opens new avenues for India’s services sector across areas such as information technology and IT-enabled services, finance, education, tourism and construction.

India-NZ trade details

A key pillar of the agreement is services and mobility. New Zealand has offered market access in 118 services sectors and sub sectors and extended Most Favoured Nation treatment in 139 services sectors. India, in turn, has granted New Zealand market access in 106 service sectors and MFN treatment in 45 sectors. The agreement also includes an annex on health and traditional medicine services to promote trade in these areas, marking the first time New Zealand has signed such an annex with any country.

Mobility provisions feature prominently in the pact. For the first time, New Zealand has signed an Annex on Student Mobility and Post Study Work Visas with another country. The arrangement places no numerical limits and guarantees Indian students the right to work 20 hours per week. Post study work visas have been provided for up to three years for graduates with bachelor’s degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, up to three years for master’s degree holders and up to four years for doctoral graduates.

The agreement also creates a new pathway for Temporary Employment Entry Visas, allowing up to 5,000 Indian professionals in skilled occupations to stay in New Zealand for a maximum period of three years. Eligible categories include AYUSH practitioners, yoga instructors, Indian chefs and music teachers, along with professionals from sectors such as information technology, engineering, healthcare, education and construction. In addition, a Working Holiday Visa arrangement will allow 1,000 young Indians to travel to New Zealand each year with multiple entries for a 12 month period.

On the goods front, India’s simple average MFN tariff of 16.2 percent will fall to 13.18 percent once the agreement comes into force, further reducing to 10.30 percent after five years and reaching 9.06 percent by the tenth year. Market access has been extended on 70.03 percent of tariff lines, while 29.97 percent have been excluded, largely covering sensitive sectors such as dairy, select animal and vegetable products, sugar, fats and oils, arms and ammunition, gems and jewellery, and copper and aluminium products.

India-New Zealand trade deal: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his New Zealand counterpart Christopher Luxon on Monday had a telephonic conversation and announced finalising the India-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Both leaders stressed that this FTA would help enhance trade, investment, innovation, and shared opportunities between the two countries.Negotiations for the trade deal began during New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s visit to India in March 2025, with both sides positioning the pact as a major step towards deepening bilateral economic ties. The agreement is expected to significantly enhance economic engagement, improve market access, encourage investment flows and strengthen strategic cooperation between the two countries. It is also projected to create new opportunities for innovators, entrepreneurs, farmers, MSMEs, students and youth across a wide range of sectors.Christopher Luxon shared in a post on X, ""I've just spoken with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi following the conclusion of the NZ-India Free Trade Agreement. The FTA reduces or removes tariffs on 95% of our exports to India. It's forecast that NZ exports to India could increase $1.1B to $1.3B per year over the coming two decades.Boosting trade means more Kiwi jobs, higher wages and more opportunities for hard working New Zealanders. The agreement builds on the strong friendship between our two countries. India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and this gives Kiwi businesses access to 1.4 billion Indian consumers. Our Government is relentlessly focused on fixing the basics and building the future - with new trade deals like this helping to grow our economy so all Kiwis can get ahead.""In the fiscal year 2024-25, bilateral merchandise trade stood at $1.3 billion, while the total trade in goods and services was approximately $2.4 billion in 2024, with services trade alone accounting for $1.24 billion.","A.

Domestically the macros and fundamentals are positive and look promising. This can embolden the bulls to take the rally to new highs in Nifty and Sensex soon. But externally, the strong revival in AI trade is a mild negative. This can delay the much anticipated reversal of FII outflows. There is more volatility ahead in AI trade.

"Gold price hits record high! Yellow metal jumps to $4,383.76 in early trade — What's driving the rally?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-prices-hit-record-high-yellow-metal-jumps-to-4383-76-in-early-trade-whats-driving-the-rally/articleshow/126112531.cms,"(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold prices on Monday hit record high on expectations of more interest rate cuts by the US Fed and the yellow metal's status as the steady safe-haven amid weak dollar.Spot gold surged to $4,383.73 after fresh US economic data signalled continued weakness in the labour market, while easing inflation strengthened expectations of further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. This took the yellow metal past its previous record high of $4,381.52, set in October. The Fed, delivered a quarter-point rate cut last week, fuelling hopes of more easing ahead. Investors are now expecting in two US rate cuts in 2026, a scenario that boosts the appeal of non-yielding assets such as gold.The precious metal, traditionally seen as a hedge in times of uncertainty, has risen 67% so far this year. The rally has been driven by persistent geopolitical and trade tensions, strong buying by central banks and expectations of lower interest rates next year. A softer dollar index has added further support by making gold cheaper for overseas buyers.The global momentum has also been reflected in domestic markets. Last week, MCX gold futures climbed Rs 574, or 0.43% to hit an all-time high of Rs 1,35,590 per 10 grams on Thursday. This marked the fourth consecutive weekly gain and puts gold on course for its twelfth straight monthly rise.Explaining the reason behind last week's rally, Prathamesh Mallya of Angel One said, “weak dollar, dovish federal reserve, lower inflation data in the US triggered the momentum in gold prices in the recent week.”While gold has posted strong gains, silver has outperformed the yellow metal. Last Friday, silver prices surged 8.08%, touching a record high of Rs 2,08,603 per kilogram. The white metal has climbed more than 130% this year, supported by strong exchange-traded fund inflows and concerns around yen carry trades amid expectations of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan.Looking ahead, market experts remain optimistic about both metals but have flagged the possibility of near-term corrections. Pranav Mer said silver could see further upside, though the risk-reward balance remains stretched.“We continue to maintain positive view in gold and expect prices to rise further to Rs 1,40,000-1,45,000 by early next year, with support for reversal placed at Rs 1,29,000 per 10 grams,” he said.","Spot gold surged to $4,383.73 after fresh US economic data signalled continued weakness in the labour market.

"'Policy decision': US judge refuses to scrap Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee; move to curb immigration",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/policy-decision-us-judge-refuses-to-scrap-trumps-100000-h-1b-visa-fee-move-to-curb-immigration/articleshow/126151303.cms,"Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

What is the $100,000 H-1B fee?

Which companies could be most affected?



A US federal judge upheld the Trump administration's move to move ahead with President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, dealing a setback to the American technology companies and business groups challenging the move.US District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington DC on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Commerce, which argued that the steep fee violated federal immigration law and would force companies, hospitals and other employers to cut jobs and services.Howell ruled that Trump had the legal authority to impose the fee, noting that his proclamation was issued under ""an express statutory grant of authority to the President.""""The parties’ vigorous ‌debate over the ultimate wisdom of this political judgment is not within the province of the courts,"" Howell wrote, Reuters reported.""So long as the actions dictated by the policy decision and articulated in the Proclamation fit within the confines of the law, the Proclamation must be upheld,"" she added.The Chamber of Commerce had argued that the president lacked the power to impose such a fee and warned it would hurt employers that rely on skilled foreign workers.Its executive vice president and chief counsel Daryl Joseffer said many small and medium-sized businesses would struggle to afford the cost. ""We are disappointed in ‍the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure ‌that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended,"" Joseffer said in a statement.The H-1B visa programme allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialised fields and is widely used by technology companies. The programme issues 65,000 visas annually, with an additional 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, typically valid for three to six years.Until now, H-1B visa fees generally ranged between $2,000 and $5,000, depending on various factors. Under Trump's order, however, the fee for new H-1B applications would jump sharply to $100,000.H-1B visas are allocated through a lottery system, though the programme mainly serves the tech sector. The US Department of Homeland Security has also moved to overhaul the selection process, replacing the random lottery with a system that favours higher-paid and more highly skilled foreign workers.The Trump administration says this change is aimed at protecting American wages and jobs.Companies such as Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are among the largest users of H-1B visas, according to US government data cited by Bloomberg.Opponents of the policy argue that the higher fee would force employers to choose between significantly higher labour costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers. Separate legal challenges have also been filed by Democratic-led states and a coalition of employers, nonprofits and religious organisations.In issuing the order, Trump cited his authority under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of foreign nationals deemed detrimental to US interests.Judge Howell further stated that the administration had adequately supported its claim that the H-1B programme was displacing American workers, pointing to examples where companies laid off thousands of US employees while continuing to seek H-1B visas.","US District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington DC on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Commerce.

Foreigners Buy Indian Shares After Three-Week Selloff

Santa Claus Rally

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

The story of Indian stock markets has been defined by the exodus of foreign investors in 2025. But in the last few sessions, foreign investors seem to be back on Dalal Street, with purchases of Indian equities seeing a surge last week, marking the strongest inflows in nearly two months, as the rupee staged a sharp recovery from record lows.Overseas investors bought $644 million worth of domestic shares, the highest level since mid-October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The renewed buying interest came as the rupee recorded its largest weekly gain in almost six months, reversing part of the pressure seen earlier.The inflows followed a period of sustained selling, during which foreign investors had pulled out nearly $1.8 billion from Indian equities over the previous three weeks. That phase of outflows coincided with a slide of more than 1 percent in the rupee, which had weighed on returns for dollar-based investors.The recent turnaround underlines the strong relationship between currency movements and foreign portfolio flows into Indian stocks. Since exchange rate fluctuations directly influence returns for overseas investors, greater stability in the rupee is seen as a crucial factor in maintaining global interest in the country’s equity markets.Meanwhile, experts are of the view that the stock market could see a year-end rally as analysts point to the possibility of a seasonal Santa rally, supported by a mix of historical trends and favourable technical indicators.Data from ICICI Direct shows that the Nifty has delivered gains in 23 of the last 30 years, or about 77% of the time, during the period from December 20 to the end of the year.

BoFA Securities has a buy rating on Varun Beverages with the target price at Rs 550. Analysts said that VBL has acquired Twizza, the no 4 player in South Africa, enhancing production capacity with its three backward integrated facilities. This complements the company’s manufacturing footprint and strengthens VBL's market position. The deal was done at an attractive valuation that adds 6% to VBL volume, 4% to its revenue and 2% to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). Overall execution and delivery next summer are the key for the company.Nuvama has a buy rating on Century Plywood with the target price at Rs 1,028. Analysts said that the company’s management was confident of achieving Rs 12,000 crore revenue by FY31 targeting 18% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). The company can achieve Rs 700 crore – Rs 750 crore revenue from the current gross block and will need further Rs 2,000 crore – Rs 2,500 crore investment by FY29 to achieve FY31 target. The company also said that its plywood execution was strong, while medium-density fibreboard (MDF) margins shall turn around H2FY27 onwards, laminates turnaround is in progress, and particle board to record EBITDA breakeven by Q3FY26.Nomura has a buy on Samvardhana Motherson with the target price at Rs 125. Analysts said that the company is acquiring Nexans Auto’s wiring harness business through which it’s set to foray into the global photovoltaic wiring harness segment with an attractive acquisition. They expect the potential transaction to be cash earnings per share (EPS)-accretive. Analysts believe the acquisition is attractively valued and could potentially lead to EPS accretion of 2% in the first year itself.Morgan Stanley has initiated its coverage of Pine Labs with an equal weight rating and the target price at Rs 260. Analysts said that the company is a leader in its focus segments, benefits from first mover advantage and a strong partner ecosystem. They projected a 19% revenue CAGR for FY25-FY28 and expect its shift towards an asset-light model to drive EBIT margin to 20% by FY28 (against 3% in FY25).Investec has initiated its buy rating on Canara HSBC Life Insurance with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 225. Analysts said that the stock is a mispriced opportunity as it’s a relatively low-risk way to play the structural life insurance growth story in India.

CEAT has undergone a healthy corrective phase, declining nearly 17.6% from its recent peak of ₹4,438 and moving into the ₹3,930–₹3,900 zone. This region coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the prior rally, indicating the presence of a potential demand pocket.The technical structure is showing early signs of stabilization, with falling trendline breakout indications visible on both price action and RSI, suggesting flattening momentum and a possible reversal setup. As long as ₹3,765 remains protected, the risk–reward remains favourable for a recovery move toward ₹4,300.Endurance Technologies has corrected approximately 14.5% from its peak of ₹2,986 and is currently trading near the ₹2,680–₹2,650 zone, where the stock is showing signs of stabilization. This zone aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, the 200-DEMA, and a prior breakout region, indicating strong confluence support.Additionally, positive divergence on both RSI and MACD points toward weakening downside momentum and the possibility of a near-term trend reversal. Sustaining above ₹2,545 keeps the structure constructive for an upside move toward ₹2,850.After a sharp 42% correction since July 2025, HPL has approached a key demand zone last seen in February 2025, where strong buying interest had previously emerged.The stock has now taken out its prior swing high, signalling a potential trend shift rather than a mere relief bounce.This improvement is further supported by the daily RSI breaking above its previous swing levels, indicating strengthening momentum and renewed accumulation. If the stock holds above ₹375, the structure supports continuation toward ₹460 in the coming sessions.","According to Mehul Kothari, DVP - Technical Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, the top stocks to buy are: HPL Electric & Power, Endurance Technologies, andCEAT.

Tech Savvy CEOs

'Strategy, Not Reaction'

MUMBAI: From HUL abruptly replacing Rohit Jawa as the CEO to the sudden resignation of Britannia vice-chairman, MD & CEO Varun Berry - 2025 has been the year of CEO churn in consumer firms. The pace of top deck rejigging at companies in the space this year has been significantly higher than in the past few years, analysts at executive search and advisory firm Longhouse said.Few of the new appointments to corner offices, as in the case of Nestle India, have been part of natural progression, following the retirement of previous chiefs but most of the changes have been driven by companies' push to get faster growth in India where competition from digital-first brands are challenging traditional norms of doing business.HUL, for instance, passed on the baton to homegrown talent Priya Nair who as president (beauty & wellbeing) at Unilever came with expertise in the category, one of HUL's key focus areas. L'Oreal replaced Aseem Kaushik with internal candidate Jacques Lebel as India country manager while former CEO & MD of Arvind Fashions Shailesh Chaturvedi retired early, making way for successor Amisha Jain.""The increase in CEO churn reflects how sharply India's operating environment has changed.This is no longer a straightforward high-growth market - it's become far more complex and competitive. Double-digit growth has tapered to low single-digits, margins are under sustained pressure, and omni-channel disruptions have added layers of complexity. As a result, boards and investors are reassessing leadership far more frequently,"" Sonal Bahl, partner at Positive Moves told TOI.Some of the new CEO appointments point to an emerging trend - the focus among companies to get digital savvy chiefs at a time when discovery of products is increasingly happening online and consumers are getting used to shopping from 10-minute delivery platforms.Nestle India's chairman & MD Manish Tiwary joins from Amazon where he last held the position of India country manager. Tiwary, also an HUL alumnus and FMCG veteran brings both digital and offline retail experience. Reliance Retail Ventures created a new CEO post altogether as it prepares for a potential IPO, roping in Flipkart's former chief product and technology officer Jeyandran Venugopal for the role. A key mandate for Venugopal at Reliance Retail Ventures is to accelerate omni-channel growth. While appointing former Levi's executive Jain as CEO & MD, Arvind Fashions said that it aligns with the firm's strategic focus on digital transformation and brand equity.""Traditional companies are increasingly prioritising financial efficiency instead of expanding headcount. Alongside this shift, there is a clear trend toward appointing digital-first leaders to strengthen digital capabilities and improve the contribution of digital revenues to the overall business,"" said Rohit Srivastava, senior partner at Longhouse.Boards have become far less patient with long learning curves. When gaps in execution, strategic alignment or market responsiveness become visible, boards are intervening earlier than they might have in the past, said Bahl.""In retail and FMCG, the churn was more strategic than reactive. Companies were not just filling roles, they were redesigning leadership for a digital future,"" added Mala Chawla, MD, India & Singapore at Stanton Chase.","The pace of top deck rejigging at companies in the space this year has been significantly higher than in the past few years.

What’s your overall assessment on growth and inflation , and are we nearing the end of the current interest rate cycle?



What is the outlook on inflation?



Given trade tensions, how do we build buffers?



You said there is enough room for expansion in the economy. You want to touch on your reading of the output gap?



MoSPI will be undertaking changes to GDP, inflation and industrial production data. What are the points that you are watching closely?



You spoke about following economies that have lowered inflation targets and narrowed the tolerance band, do you see RBI adopting multiple targets as well?



What is your view on the debate over whether the focus should be on headline or core inflation?



What is being done to improve research and monetary policy communication?



What are your thoughts on the FTAs being signed by India with other countries? Will they help diversify exports and imports?



So, there will not be any risk of overstimulation?



RBI deputy governor Poonam Gupta is upbeat on India’s growth prospects, especially due to a series of reforms. In her first interview since taking charge eight months ago, she tells TOI that the recent movement of the rupee is not a concern. Excerpts:On the growth front, if one simply plots India’s growth rate over the past four decades, the trend exhibits steady acceleration. Currently, we are in a position similar to the East Asian economies when they transitioned to high-middle-income status. Beyond demographics, India has the advantage of large domestic consumption and a diversified economic base, unlike countries reliant on a couple of sectors such as natural resources or manufacturing.Across different sectors, agriculture is becoming more resilient to natural shocks, with rising productivity driven by greater mechanisation, scale, and diversification. Manufacturing remains aspirational and is growing broadly in line with the average of agriculture and services, at about 7-8%. Within manufacturing, diversification is also increasing. Services, where India is a global leader, continues to be the largest and the fastest growing part of the economy.Reforms have picked up pace in recent years and have now cumulated to a point where they can deliver even stronger growth outcomes. That is why, despite a 50% US tariff and elevated global uncertainty, the Indian economy is performing well. With no new structural risks in sight, growth could easily come at 7-7.5% in the coming years, with limited downside risks. Given the reforms already undertaken, their ongoing momentum, and the underlying strengths of the economy, growth could move to an even higher trajectory in the years to come.From a medium term perspective, inflation has been trending downwards. We are just about to complete 10 years of inflation targeting. Inflation has declined on average during the last 10 years and has become less volatile. Inflation has been exceptionally benign this year, and is likely to remain so for several months. RBI’s forecast for 2025-26 stands at 2%, the lower end of the tolerance band. Structurally, as economies become larger, more mature, and more prosperous, inflation tends to decline. This happens for several reasons: their capacity increases, productivity improves, and their supply response becomes faster.If one goes by these global trends, inflation in India too should continue to trend lower and become more stable in the medium term.As for the current policy rate cycle, the Monetary Policy Committee has already reduced it by a cumulative 125 basis points in less than a year. Thus, a significant action has already occurred in the current cycle. Yet, the current neutral stance gives it the flexibility to take further action depending on incoming data. If the inflation outlook remains benign and the inflation-growth outlook so warrants, then hypothetically the MPC could consider further action.The economy is doing well despite the recent tariff shock because of its in-built strengths and buffers. It is partly owing to diversification and partly attributed to quick and nimble policy responses. The increasing number of FTAs signed, alongside GST and labour reforms, is leading to further strengthening of these buffers.Forex volatility is a concern. How will it impact the economy and to what extent can RBI defend the rupee?India’s external position has been and remains resilient across both the current and capital accounts. On the current account, three pillars hold. First, we have always had a merchandise trade deficit, but it has not been accelerating. Second, services continue to perform ever more strongly. Third, remittances are large and roughly match the services surplus at about 3% of GDP. For a fast-growing emerging market economy such as ours, a 2-3% current account deficit is considered sustainable. This year’s CAD estimate is much below that at around 1-1.2% of GDP, reflective of a growing economy.On the capital account, India receives a healthy dose of FDI. Besides FDI, it receives foreign portfolio investment and other sources of capital such as bank flows and external commercial borrowings, among others. This year, foreign portfolio investment has been relatively weak. Research shows a pecking order for capital flows for their stability, with FDI being the most stable, and portfolio flows being more fickle.The current observed pattern of India’s capital flows aligns with this ranking.The rupee’s current trajectory aligns well with its historical trends. Average depreciation over the past decade is about 3% a year. There are variations from year-to-year around the 3 % average. There are years when the exchange rate depreciation has been higher, followed by relatively stable periods. This year’s slide, at around 4.5%, is aligned with past experience and is in the ballpark. The inflation pass-through of such a rate of depreciation is likely to be very mild, limited to a few basis points. Instead, it should work as an automatic stabiliser and be somewhat positive, in net terms, for the economy.Going by RBI’s capacity-utilisation survey, utilisation is currently at about 74% and has not risen. Although we do not have hard data on the level of capacity utilisation when fresh investment actually kicks in, my working hypothesis is that the trigger threshold has likely moved up and that it varies by sector—some sectors may run close to 90% before adding capacity.Going by this, we still have slack in the economy and the capacity for the economy to grow faster.Besides, the production process itself has possibly changed. Services—and parts of manufacturing—have turned nimble. Through gig-style supply, and contract hiring they can meet demand faster than before, stretching their existing capacity further. Hence, strong growth—about 8.2% this quarter and near 8% in the last quarter—coexists with benign inflation. Headline, food, and even core ex-gold inflation remains moderate. Besides, wage pressures are absent suggesting that there is still slack in the economy, implying that we are unlikely to see inflationary pressures or overheating anytime soon.There have been some criticism of RBI’s inflation forecasting…Forecast errors are a common feature around the world. Inflation forecasting is even more challenging in India, given the high and outdated weight of food in the CPI basket and the volatile nature of food prices.Just like most other central banks, professional forecasters or multilateral institutions, RBI makes forecast errors too. However, there's no systematic bias in these errors. Besides, we are constantly striving to improve our approach to forecasting inflation. RBI uses a suite of structural and time-series models to forecast inflation. These models are continuously reviewed and upgraded. In addition, we have enhanced our engagement and have stepped up stakeholder consultation including with agriculture experts, industry bodies, and professional forecasters. We engage more, listen harder, and treat criticism as input, not noise.Bottom line: RBI does its job well, without systematic bias. Still, we stay on our toes. The intention is that policy must keep pace with fast changing economy, with expanding digital commerce, shifting consumption baskets and changes in financing.RBI has a close, two-way engagement with MoSPI. We exchange views and inputs year-round. MoSPI has run an impressively extensive, rigorous, and consultative process in revising the series and we are keenly awaiting the revised data series.It is being widely anticipated that food’s weightage in the CPI index will likely fall in the revised CPI series. Equally importantly, the composition of food is likely to change too. If it results in a lower weight of volatile food items like specific vegetables, that will make inflation series even more stable. If inflation volatility drops, policymaking will become smoother and business decisions steadier.Another important issue to watch out for would be reweighting: which items in the price basket will gain as the weightage of food weightage shrinks. Overall, we must wait and watch to assess the net implication of a revised series on the level of inflation and its volatility.Most countries which have adopted inflation target have a single objective of price stability. India follows flexible inflation targeting. Flexibility comes from the tolerance band and from the mandate itself—price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth. The US is one of the few economies which has a dual target, pairing inflation with employment.We recently reviewed global practice for our discussion paper on inflation targeting and found no shift across countries toward multiple targets. Countries are choosing to retain a single target of price stability. There have also been instances of countries like New Zealand which reverted to price stability as the sole mandate before briefly working with a dual mandate.Another issue to consider is whether central banks have adequate policy tools to target multiple different targets.Take the target of employment, for example. Employment depends on a number of factors: economic growth, skills, efficiency of labour markets; regulation; sectoral mix of the economy and their respective employment elasticities; policies at the state level; labour market regulations etc. Central banks don’t control most of these levers. Their main policy tool is the policy rate.Targets without tools would not be effective. That’s why central banks generally avoid multiple targets. I guess one must stay humble about what all monetary policy can deliver.Most IT frameworks target headline as the metric. Globally countries review their frameworks every few years. Some emerging markets have lowered targets and narrowed bands during such periodic reviews.Having once adopted it, no country has ever abandoned inflation targeting. It is believed to have worked well for the most part, and no credible alternative has emerged. Thus far, it remains the global default.This issue is under review, so I’ll respond more narrowly based on my previous work on cross country experiences and the extensive consultations that we have conducted around the framework. Globally, many economies have recently reviewed inflation targeting—the US, Canada, the European Central Bank—each via different routes. We chose a consultative path. We issued a discussion paper, in which we invited views on a few focused aspects of the framework. We have collated the responses that we have received and are sharing them with the government.The response we have collated articulated clear messages. The majority of the responses favour retaining headline inflation. They have backed a 4% target for India’s current trajectory. They have cautioned against narrowing or reshaping the band amidst global and climate related uncertainty.RBI houses one of the country’s largest pool of economists/statisticians. We are continually trying to build and leverage that strength harder. We are engaging more internally as well as with the wider research community. We are striving to improve the relevance, rigour and reach of our research offerings.Results are emerging, but this is a continuous process. Timely, relevant, and rigorous policy research is a moving target.In terms of communication, both the literature and practices have evolved. Earlier, it was believed that there ought to be surprises in monetary policy announcements in order for them to be effective. After the advent of inflation targeting, it is increasingly believed that more transparency, more engagement, and fewer surprises yield better outcomes. In fact, communication and forward guidance are now being considered as additional policy tools at the disposal of central banks.I see FTAs strengthening India’s resilience and speeding prosperity. Opening more external markets will help. Even amid a shock as large as a 50% tariff by the US, the economy has stayed calm—and new market access will further cushion it. Among the feedback that we hear, most stakeholders are comfortable and optimistic about the outcomes of the trade deals being signed.Will FTAs curb over-reliance on specific export/import partners? In principle, yes—but trade diversions can take some time. Capacity must exist in the trading partners; they must be able to supply what we import, at competitive prices, and vice versa.More markets opening—and a potential US deal—could make external demand stronger than before. That additional demand would have the potential for us to use our existing capacity better, spur investment, and lift growth. Taken together, this appears to be an inflection point, setting the stage for an accelerated take-off.I do not perceive any overstimulation risk at this point. Enhanced demand can be met without strain with capacity utilisation sitting at nearly 74%. If demand accelerates beyond what the current capacity can handle, then more investment will follow and result in additional capacity creation. I see no roadblocks to more investment occurring in such a situation. There is ample and affordable financing available to fund any such investment push. Most nominal indicators do not point to overheating in the foreseeable future.","RBI deputy governor Poonam Gupta is upbeat on India’s growth prospects, especially due to a series of reforms.

Gold and silver rebounded last week after sharp profit booking toward the end of the week before that, with silver breaking the psychological ₹2 lakh mark on the domestic front continuously marking all-time high, while gold also hit record highs hovering ~$4400 on Comex. Silver has surged over 120% YTD in 2025 and gold over 65%, making both among the best-performing assets of the year. Softer US Treasury yields and a weaker dollar index, lingering around 98, with volatility in USDINR supported prices continued to support domestic prices.Last week, amidst RBI Intervention USDINR fell by almost Rs 2. The Federal Reserve’s 25 bps rate cut in December meeting, delivered amid a divided vote, reinforced expectations of policy uncertainty, with officials offering mixed views on the future rate path. Recent US data showed rising unemployment, weaker-than-expected payroll additions for October and November, and mixed retail sales, keeping pressure on yields and the dollar.Silver backwardation widened again, signalling supply tightness and strong speculative interest, while gold faced mild demand headwinds in India due to record prices despite the wedding season. Globally, safe-haven demand remained intact amid geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty.Markets now await key triggers including US housing numbers, GDP, PCE price index, consumer confidence, durable goods orders data. We are heading towards holiday shortened days as well amidst the Christmas holiday so volatility could also get thin.With support of Rs. 132,000 prices could target towards 138,000-140,000.

The US economy expanded in the third quarter at the fastest pace in two years, bolstered by resilient consumer and business spending and calmer trade policies.Inflation-adjusted GDP, which measures the value of goods and services produced in the US, increased at a 4.3% annualised pace, a Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed on Tuesday. That was higher than all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey and followed 3.8% growth in the prior period.The BEA was originally due to publish an advance estimate of GDP on Oct. 30, but the report was cancelled due to govt shutdown. The S& rose in early trading Tuesday, while Treasuries fell. The delayed report card shows the economy maintained momentum through the middle of the year as consumers powered ahead and the most punitive of Trump's tariffs were rolled back. While the shutdown is expected to weigh on fourth-quarter growth, economists expect a modest rebound in 2026.","Inflation-adjusted GDP, which measures the value of goods and services produced in the US, increased at a 4.3% annualised pace.

Pakistan government on Tuesday sold its national airline, PIA, for Rs 135 billion to a consortium led by Arif Habib investment firm on Tuesday. The sale, organised through a bidding process in Islamabad, marks the largest transaction in Pakistan's history.It aims to revive the once-prestigious carrier that had been struggling due to years of mismanagement, as reported by PTI.There were three companies bidding for this auction, namely Arif Habib, Lucky Cement, and Airblue. Arif Habib won this auction after an aggressive bidding process against Lucky Cement. The successful auction cost of Rs 135 billion was much higher than the government's reference price of Rs 100 billion. Airblue has quoted the lowest amount, Rs 26.5 billion.The sale will involve 75% of the shares of PIA at this stage, and the successful bidder will have 90 days to purchase the rest 25%. A greater portion of the money accruing from the sale of the national carrier, 92.5%, will be invested in the airline, while the remaining 7.5% will be paid to the government.The deal requires Arif Habib to invest an additional Rs 80 billion in PIA over the next five years.This comes after the government took over the airline's massive debt of Rs 654 billion last year to make the sale more attractive.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the transparent nature of the sale. ""It will be the largest transaction ever in Pakistan's history,"" he stated during a federal cabinet meeting.The entire bidding process was broadcast live on local TV channels. This successful sale came after a failed attempt last year when the airline didn't attract the desired price.PIA's privatization marks the end of an era for what was once a prominent airline. Years of poor management had severely impacted its service quality and reputation, ultimately forcing the government to sell it to private investors.","Pakistan government sold its national airline, PIA, for Rs 135 billion to a consortium led by Arif Habib investment firm on Tuesday.

'Economic golden age': Donald Trump hails Q3 GDP beat as proof of tariffs push; inflation and jobs data add caution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/economic-golden-age-donald-trump-hails-q3-gdp-beat-as-proof-of-tariffs-push-inflation-and-jobs-data-add-caution/articleshow/126144571.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday seized on stronger-than-expected third-quarter growth to claim an “economic golden age,” arguing that tariffs and his tax policies were driving a sharp acceleration in activity even as official data pointed to lingering inflation pressures and a softening labour market.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the US economy’s 4.3% annualised growth rate in the July–September quarter had “BLOWN PAST expectations” and credited his policies for the performance. “The SUCCESS is due to Good Government, and TARIFFS,” he wrote, adding that “Consumer spending is STRONG, Net Exports are WAY UP, Imports and Trade Deficits are WAY DOWN, and there is NO INFLATION.”He also claimed that investment was “SETTING RECORDS” because of his tax bill and tariffs, declaring that the “Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead.”The Commerce Department’s data showed that gross domestic product expanded at a 4.3% annual rate in the third quarter, accelerating from 3.8% growth in the April–June period and comfortably beating forecasts of around 3%, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. It was the first of three official estimates for the quarter, released after delays linked to the government shutdown.Growth was supported by robust consumer spending, exports and government outlays.Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US economic activity, rose at a 3.5% annual pace, up from 2.5% in the previous quarter. Exports increased at an 8.8% rate, while imports fell 4.7%, providing a boost to headline GDP.A measure of the economy’s underlying strength — combining consumer spending and private investment while excluding volatile components such as inventories, trade and government spending — grew at a 3% annual rate, slightly higher than the 2.9% pace recorded in the second quarter.However, the growth report also showed that inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s comfort zone. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose at a 2.8% annual pace in the third quarter, up from 2.1% in the previous quarter. Core PCE inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, climbed to 2.9% from 2.6%.The labour market data has also been mixed. The government reported last week that the US economy added 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest level since 2021.Despite inflation staying above the Fed’s 2% target, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate three times toward the end of 2025, citing concerns about slowing momentum in hiring.","US economy grew at 4.3% annualised rate in the July–September quarter.

Tariff jitters: US consumer confidence slips in December; inflation and jobs worries deepen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariff-jitters-us-consumer-confidence-slips-in-december-inflation-and-jobs-worries-deepen/articleshow/126144113.cms,"'India Got Out Of The Gates Faster Than Most Nations', Says US Expert As Trade Deal Talks Nears End

US consumer confidence weakened in December, sliding to its lowest level since President Donald Trump rolled out sweeping tariffs earlier this year, as households grew more anxious about high prices, trade levies and job prospects, according to a survey by the Conference Board.The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December from an upwardly revised 92.9 in November, AP reported. The reading is close to the 85.7 level recorded in April, when the Trump administration introduced import taxes on key US trading partners, AP reported.Consumers’ assessment of current economic conditions saw a sharper drop. The present situation index fell 9.5 points to 116.8, reflecting growing unease about inflation and employment conditions. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained the biggest concern for consumers, alongside tariffs.Short-term expectations for income, business conditions and the labour market were little changed at 70.7, but remained well below 80 — a threshold that can signal a recession ahead. This was the 11th straight month that expectations stayed under that level.Perceptions of the job market also weakened. The share of consumers who said jobs were “plentiful” fell to 26.7% in December from 28.2% in November, while those who said jobs were “hard to get” rose to 20.8% from 20.1%.The softer sentiment follows recent labour market data showing mixed signals. Government figures released last week showed the US economy added 64,000 jobs in November after losing 105,000 jobs in October. The unemployment rate climbed to 4.6% last month, its highest level since 2021.Economists say the labour market is stuck in a “low hire, low fire” phase, as companies remain cautious amid uncertainty over tariffs and the lingering effects of high interest rates. Since March, average monthly job creation has slowed to about 35,000, down from 71,000 in the year ended March. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said he suspects those figures could be revised even lower, AP reported.","The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December.

Trump Immigration Offensive SHOCK Reveal; Workplace Raids, Expanded Detention Incoming Next Year

President Trump’s executive office – the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is currently reviewing a rule submitted by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This rule – ‘Weighted selection process for H-1B cap applications’, once approved and finalized will fundamentally alter the way H-1B visas are allocated.DHS intends to weigh the lottery based on salary levels tied to the Department of Labor’s (DOL) four-tier wage system – this would give those with a higher wage a better chance of being selected in the H-1B lottery. This move follows just days after the DOL sent a proposed rule to OMB for review, which sought to hike prevailing H-1B wages across all levels.Immigration attorneys are largely of the view that the weighted selection rule will be finalized and implemented before the next H-1B filing season. There is an annual quota of 85,000 for H-1B cap applications. E-registrations for H-1B applications open up in March. As demand significantly exceeds supply, post registration a random lottery is conducted. The sponsoring employers then file a detailed H-1B application for those candidates (beneficiaries) who were successfully selected in the lottery.This random selection mechanism will change. In September, when the ‘weighted lottery approach’ rule was released for public comments, TOI had done a deep dive into the mechanism and implications.An H-1B candidate with a Level IV wage offer (the highest tier) would be entered into the lottery four times, while a Level III beneficiary would be entered three times, a Level II beneficiary twice, and a Level I beneficiary only once. This ‘weighted lottery’ approach would give higher odds of selection to those offered the highest wages.Under the current system, all beneficiaries (across all four levels) entered in the lottery face equal odds of selection of about 29.59%. Under the proposed rule, however, odds diverge sharply by wage level.The implications for the Indian diaspora who aspire to work in the US at lower tiers – including new graduates from US universities are stark. For the fiscal ended September 2024, of the 1.41 lakh H-1B applications approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), 80,449 (or 57%) were for Indian beneficiaries. It should be noted that the total figure is above the annual quota of 85,000 as USCIS keeps a buffer for rejections or employers withdrawing from the process.The National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) states that under the new mechanism, the probability of selecting an individual at Level IV for an H-1B application would increase by 107% but fall by 48% for individuals at Level I. Effectively, the rule would tilt opportunities heavily toward mid-career professionals or those in senior roles, while creating a barrier for entry-level professionals, including the bulk of recent international graduates from US universities.NFAP found that, compared to the current system, individuals at Level I would receive 11,518 fewer H-1B selections, while people at Level IV would gain 4,426 more, Level III would receive 5,528 more H-1B selections and Level II would get an additional 1,564.","President Trump’s executive office – the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is currently reviewing a rule submitted by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) This move follows just days after the DOL sent a proposed rule to OMB for review, which sought to hike prevailing H-1B wages across all levels.

The US economy grew at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 4.3% in the July–September quarter, driven by stronger consumer spending, exports and government outlays, even as inflation remained above the Federal Reserve’s comfort level, according to official data released on Tuesday, AP reported.Gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of goods and services produced, accelerated from a revised 3.8% growth rate in the April–June quarter, the Commerce Department said in a report delayed by the government shutdown. Economists surveyed by FactSet had expected growth of around 3%, AP reported.Despite the stronger expansion, inflationary pressures picked up.

A separate measure of the economy’s underlying strength — which includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile components such as exports, inventories and government spending — expanded at a 3% pace, slightly higher than the 2.9% recorded in the second quarter.Trade also contributed to growth. Exports surged at an 8.8% annual rate, while imports, which subtract from GDP, declined by 4.7%.Tuesday’s release marks the first of three official estimates for third-quarter GDP growth. Outside of the first quarter — when the economy contracted for the first time in three years as companies rushed to import goods ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariff rollout — the US economy has continued to post solid growth.This resilience has come despite sharply higher borrowing costs imposed by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 to rein in inflation that surged as the economy rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 recession of 2020.While inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, the central bank cut its benchmark lending rate three consecutive times to end 2025, largely due to concerns over a cooling labour market.Recent jobs data have pointed to slowing momentum.

China has escalated trade tensions with India by launching a dispute at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over New Delhi’s policies covering solar cells, solar modules and information technology goods, seeking formal consultations under the global trade body’s dispute settlement mechanism, Reuters reported.The WTO said on Tuesday that China has requested dispute consultations with India, Reuters reported, marking the first procedural step in resolving trade disagreements under WTO rules.“China said the measures in question include India’s tariff treatment and certain measures that China said are contingent upon the use of domestic inputs and otherwise discriminate against Chinese imports,” the WTO said in a statement, quoted Reuters.Earlier last week, China had moved the WTO against India by formally requesting consultations, challenging New Delhi’s tariffs on information and communication technology (ICT) products and subsidy measures in the solar sector, PTI reported.In a statement, China’s Ministry of Commerce alleged that India’s measures violate multiple WTO obligations, including the principle of national treatment, and amount to import-substitution subsidies that are explicitly prohibited under WTO rules.“They grant unfair competitive advantages to India’s domestic industries while undermining China’s interests,” the ministry said, urging India to honour its WTO commitments and promptly revise the disputed measures.The latest move comes less than a week after India announced the imposition of anti-dumping duties on cold-rolled steel imports from China for a period of five years, a step New Delhi said was aimed at protecting its domestic industry.In October, Beijing had sought consultations over what it described as unfair subsidies provided by India to its electric vehicle and battery sectors.That earlier petition alleged that India’s incentive schemes for electric vehicles and batteries distorted competition and adversely affected Chinese manufacturers.Under WTO rules, consultations are the first formal step in the dispute process, giving both sides a chance to sit across the table and try to settle their differences before the issue moves towards a dispute settlement panel.",China has escalated trade tensions with India by launching a dispute at the World Trade Organization.

Discovery deal

NEW DELHI: Paramount Skydance, a media and entertainment company, has amended its all-cash takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), addressing concerns raised by WBD's board by securing a personal financial guarantee from billionaire Larry Ellison.In a statement, Paramount said Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of USD 40.4 billion.It stated ""Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of USD 40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount"".This move directly responds to questions raised by WBD directors about the financial backing behind the proposal.Paramount Skydance Corporation has reaffirmed its offer to acquire 100 per cent of WBD's outstanding shares at USD 30 per share in cash. If completed, Paramount would assume all assets and liabilities of Warner Bros. Discovery, making it a full takeover.Earlier, WBD had argued in its Schedule 14D-9 filing that the equity backstop from the Ellison family trust was inadequate. The trust holds a majority of the assets of Larry Ellison, who is also the founder of Oracle and the controlling shareholder of Paramount.WBD stated that only a personal guarantee from Ellison would resolve its concerns, a demand Paramount said was never raised during the 12 weeks before WBD agreed to what it described as an inferior transaction with Netflix.Paramount also questioned WBD's disclosures, noting that its filing does not explain the financial analysis used by the board to select the Netflix offer.It said the filing omits details on the valuation of the Global Networks stub equity, which Paramount values at USD 1 per share, and lacks clarity on debt-related adjustments under the Netflix deal.The issue centres on transparency and value for shareholders. Paramount argues that WBD investors do not have enough information to properly compare the two offers.So this highlights that the Paramount Skydance is currently pursuing a takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) through an all-cash offer. To strengthen this bid, Larry Ellison has provided a personal financial guarantee, showing that the combined group has sufficient funding to complete the deal.","Paramount Skydance, a media and entertainment company, has amended its all-cash takeover offer for Warner Bros.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Gold Price Outlook

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates are likely to maintain a sideways bias with limited upside in the near-term future.Gold prices ended the last week down on a weekly average basis despite the rally seen on Friday in International Spot markets. The rally in prices was seen driven by weaker US job data & tariff fears which weighed on the US Dollar.Meanwhile the rally was short lived as the US Dollar regained positive traction in the current week and recovered a part of Friday's weaker-than-expected US jobs data-inspired losses, acting as a headwind for the yellow metal at higher levels. Apart from this, the prevalent risk-on environment contributed to capping the upside for the safe-haven precious metal this week.The US NFP released last Friday rose by 73,000 in July, versus a 14,000 increase (revised from 147,000) prior, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed. This figure came in below the market consensus of 1,10,000. Meanwhile, the US Unemployment Rate ticked higher to 4.2% in July from 4.1% in June, indicating softness in labour demand fuelling short covering moves in gold.With few macro data points lined up in the week, gold direction still remains sideways to slightly positive for the current week.Meanwhile, on the physical demand front, India's domestic gold had generated physical buying interest during the last few weeks after a pullback in prices from Rs 1, 00,555 per 10 grams to Rs 97,700 per 10 grams was seen in domestic spot markets in July.Due to the drop in international prices last month, Indian Jewellers were also seen replenishing inventories, eventually offsetting the impact due to rupee depreciation. This is seen as a key indicator for Gold long term bullishness even though the short - term outlook still remains cloudy.In the international markets, US Dollar could attract some buyers in the week ahead, as the same seemed to have stalled the post-NFP downfall. This could hold back gold bulls from placing fresh aggressive bets capping the sharp upside from current levels. Traders also look ahead to the US Jobless claims, Consumer Sentiment data & Fed speakers later this week for further direction in prices. Overall Spot gold could likely witness key resistance zones at $ 3,385 – 3,445 per oz (CMP $ 3350) which looks unlikely to be breached on a weekly basis.In the domestic markets uncertainties persisting on US – India tariff front have propelled local currency pairs to trade at new lows since February and could also support the domestic futures prices on MCX in near term as the same is seen holding above key 1 lakh mark per 10 gm since the start of the week.","Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations for gold investors.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Thursday as US President Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on India to 50% weighed on sentiment. While Nifty50 went below 24,550, BSE Sensex was down around 150 points. At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,523.55, down 51 points or 0.21%. BSE Sensex was at 80,400.73, down 143 points or 0.18%.Thursday's trading will be influenced by the US President's implementation of additional 25% tariffs.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “""The 21 day window for the additional 25 % tariff to take effect leaves room for negotiation and an eventual deal with the US. But there is huge uncertainty surrounding the trade policy and to what extent both nations will be willing to make compromises. President Trump, fresh from the successes he has extracted in deals with others including the EU, is unlikely to budge significantly from his unjustified stand. Unfortunately for India, the US is bargaining from a position of strength. India’s response has been mature and measured.”“Market is unlikely to panic but weakness will continue in the near-term.Since uncertainty is high investors should be cautious in their approach. At least in the near-term, export-oriented sectors will remain weak. Domestic consumption themes like banking and financials, telecom, hotels, cement, capital goods and segments of automobiles will remain resilient.""US markets ended higher on Wednesday, with Nasdaq leading at over 1% growth. Apple shares increased following announcements about domestic manufacturing commitments, whilst positive corporate earnings reports also boosted sentiment.US stock futures increased early Thursday, despite Trump's warnings about 100% tariffs on semiconductor imports. Asian markets displayed mixed trading patterns in early sessions.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 4,999 crore net on Wednesday.

MUMBAI: Industrialist Anand Mahindra has said that US tariffs will have the unintended consequences of creating new growth drivers, and India should use the opportunity to unleash reforms like in 1991 and promote tourism as a forex engine. In an elaborate post on X following the tariff announcements, the Mahindra & Mahindra chairman outlined his two proposals - creating a genuine single-window clearance system for all investments, starting with willing states aligning to a national platform to deliver speed, simplicity, and predictability and draw global capital; and positioning tourism as a major foreign exchange earner by fast-tracking visas, improving facilitation, and developing secure, hygienic tourism corridors around key hotspots as models for national standards. Mahindra said that the friction with the US has nudged Europe to rethink its security dependence, leading to higher defence spending.","Industrialist Anand Mahindra has said that US tariffs will have the unintended consequences of creating new growth drivers.

US President Donald Trump after slapping an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods that said his administration is considering imposing secondary sanctions on ""a couple of others,"" hinting that China could be one of them.Speaking at a White House press briefing on Wednesday, Trump was asked if similar penalties could be imposed on China for its continued purchase of Russian oil.""It may happen. I don't know, I can't tell you yet. But we did it with India. We are probably doing it with a couple of others, one of them could be China,"" Trump told reporters during a press briefing in White House.The comments came just a day after he signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, citing national security concerns tied to India’s energy ties with Russia.Trump also confirmed that more secondary sanctions could be coming soon, signaling broader economic retaliation aimed at countries buying oil from Russia.When reporters pressed again asking Trump, ""do you have any similar plans to enact more tariffs on China?""The US President responded saying, ""Could happen. Depends on how we do. Could happen.""Despite calling out China’s Russian oil imports, Trump has so far stopped short of taking concrete action, unlike the swift move he made against India.The president further emphasised that India, which he often calls a ""friend""— is ""very close to China in terms of the purchase of oil from Russia.""However, he appeared to suggest that the tough move against New Delhi might have helped push Russia and China to resume talks with Washington.""I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but we've had very productive talks today,"" he said, referring to his envoy Steve Witkoff's parleys in Moscow.Trump’s mixed signals on China have drawn criticism from both Democrats and his own camp.Former strategist Steve Bannon and other MAGA allies have accused Trump of being inconsistent or soft on Beijing, criticism that continues to follow him from his earlier tenure, when detractors often labeled him ""Putin’s Puppet.""Earlier, former US Ambassador to the United Nations and Trump’s former primary challenger Nikki Haley criticised Trump’s stance, warning against damaging ties with a key democratic ally.""India should not be buying oil from Russia. But China, an adversary and the number one buyer of Russian and Iranian oil, got a 90-day tariff pause. Don't give China a pass and burn a relationship with a strong ally like India,"" Haley posted on X.These remarks came a day after US officials confirmed the new round of tariffs on Indian products.When asked why India was being singled out while other countries like China also continue buying Russian oil, Trump did not offer a direct explanation but indicated broader action could follow.He said, ""It's only been 8 hours. So let's see what happens. You're going to see a lot more...You're going to see so much secondary sanctions.""Trump has signed an order imposing an extra 25% tariff on imports from India, citing national security and foreign policy concerns. The White House said India's continued imports of Russian oil, both directly and indirectly, pose an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to the United States.With this move, total tariffs on Indian goods entering the US will increase to 50%. The first round of duties will start on August 7, and the additional 25% will be applied 21 days later, according to the directive.The new tariff will cover all Indian goods imported into the US, except for items already in transit or those granted specific exemptions.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) issued a strong response, calling the move ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable, further claiming that ""India will take all actions necessary to protect its national interests.""""The United States has in recent days targeted India's oil imports from Russia. We have already made clear our position on these issues, including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India."" MEA said in a statement.""It is therefore extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest,"" it added.","US President Donald Trump said his administration is considering secondary sanctions on ""a couple of others,"" hinting that China could be one of them.

NEW DELHI: The govt is likely to hold firm on its stand with the US, drawing a red line in sensitive areas such as dairy and agricultural products, including genetically modified food, while keeping the interests of Indian consumers paramount when it comes to oil purchases.""We will stick to our red lines,"" said a senior government functionary immediately after Trump announced his latest trade fatwa.While negotiators are looking to engage in further talks with their US counterparts, a breakthrough looks tough given that both sides have dug in their heels. A team of American trade negotiators is scheduled to be in the capital later this month for the sixth round of talks for a bilateral trade agreement.For the govt, lowering tariffs on farm products, such as corn and soybean, is not just politically sensitive given that it will expose small Indian farmers, many of whom are subsistence farmers, to competition from large growers in the US, who have farms spread across hundreds of acres and are subsidised by their govt. The same is true for dairy too and Indian negotiators have consistently conveyed the govt's sensitivities.GM food is another no-go area with some discussion with US earlier focusing on certification and export of processed maize as ethanol and soya oil. But Trump administration, at the political level, has been insisting on an across the board opening up.While the US is demanding zero duty access for all its products into India, there is no reciprocity in the proposed agreements, with Trump levying additional tariffs - 10%-20% - on all other countries which he has clinched deals.Govt had suggested some duty cuts to allow market access for American products into the rapidly growing market, the largest in world, and also increase purchase of oil, fertilizer and defence equipment to reduce the trade surplus that India enjoys. But the Trump administration dismissed them as inadequate.In any case, US has been unwilling to offer any concessions on sectoral tariffs such as 50% in the case of steel, aluminium and copper and 25% for automobiles & auto parts.","The govt is likely to hold firm on its stand with the US, drawing a red line in sensitive areas such as dairy and agricultural products.

Mumbai: RBI has come out with final co-lending rules for banks and non-banks which allow dual lending with a single KYC. The final norms mandate blended lending rates, irrevocable funding commitments, and escrow-based cashflow distribution, while keeping first loss default guarantee. These, along with capital impacts and lower returns, could make co-lending less attractive for originators. A 15-day loan transfer deadline may also drive lenders toward simpler direct assignment deals, ICRA said. The framework will become effective Jan 1, 2026.RBI's norms on non-fund credit have allowed banks, financial institutions and NBFCs to offer partial credit enhancement to make certain types of bonds safer for investors. This facility can be extended to bonds issued by registered entities-municipal corporations, companies or special-purpose vehicles-for funding any type of project by large, non-deposit-taking NBFCs with assets of Rs 1,000 crore or more, subject to specified conditions.An RBI panel has recommended keeping the weighted average call rate as the main monetary policy target. It suggested ending 14-day variable rate repo and reverse repo (VRR/VRRR) auctions as the main liquidity tool, replacing them with 7-day operations and flexible terms up to 14 days when needed.The RBI should usually give at least a day's notice for such actions, but can act the same day in special cases. Variable rate auctions will continue for all repo and reverse repo operations, including longer tenors. Existing liquidity management tools are considered sufficient, and the daily minimum CRR requirement will stay at 90% of the set level.","Final norms mandate blended lending rates, irrevocable funding commitments, and escrow-based cashflow distribution.

NEW DELHI: A section of Patna’s newly constructed double‑deck flyover has reportedly sunk following persistent heavy rainfall, raising fresh safety concerns over the infrastructure.The structure was built at a cost of Rs 422 crore. It was inaugurated by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on June 11, 2025 and spans the congested Ashok Rajpath corridorPatna has suffered heavy rainfall over the past few days, causing severe flooding across major areas, including Kankarbagh, Rajendra Nagar, Exhibition Road and Gandhi Maidan. Waterlogging has disrupted daily life—roads, homes, hospitals and schools were inundated, with sewage overflow, traffic chaos, and local collapse of drainage infrastructure.The relentless rains have overwhelmed poor drainage systems, leading to disruptions in daily life and prompting worry over affected infrastructure, including the flyover..The double-deck flyover has two levels. The upper deck is 2,175.5 metres long and carries traffic from Gandhi Maidan to Science College. The lower deck is 1,449.3 metres long and helps vehicles move from Patna College to Gandhi Maidan, near BN College. Both decks, each 8.5 metres wide, connect to PMCH and are meant to reduce traffic jams in the city.Officials said Ashok Rajpath will soon have four levels—two flyover tiers, a ground-level service road, and the upcoming metro underground.","The structure was built at a cost of Rs 422 crore.

The committee will assess several economic parameters, including the repo rate , liquidity conditions, CPI inflation and GDP growth outlook for India's economy.The timing of RBI’s monetary policy assumes significance since it comes at a time when India and the US have failed to reach a trade deal.

So, where is the money going?





What about rebate checks?





Hidden costs of tariffs





The white house view







Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



US President Donald Trump frequently boasts about the billions of dollars flowing into the US government’s coffers from sweeping tariffs, calling it historic, unmatched, and a windfall for the nation. But while he celebrates the surge in revenue, many are asking: Where is all that money going -and who is really paying the price?“We have a lot of money coming in, much more money than the country’s ever seen,” Trump said over the weekend, referring to revenue from tariffs.According to the US treasury department, the government collected nearly $30 billion in tariff revenue last month, a staggering 242% increase compared to July last year. Since April, when Trump introduced a 10% tariff on nearly all imported goods, followed by steeper levies, the government has collected a total of $100 billion. That’s three times the amount collected during the same four-month period last year.Trump has floated two main ideas for the tariff revenue: paying down the national debt or returning money to citizens via “tariff rebate checks.”“The purpose of what I’m doing is primarily to pay down debt, which will happen in very large quantity,” Trump said Tuesday.“But I think there’s also a possibility that we’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America.”So far, neither has happened as reported by CNN.All revenue collected by the federal government, whether from tariffs or taxes, goes into a general fund managed by the Treasury Department. This fund, sometimes referred to as “America’s checkbook,” is used to pay the government’s ongoing expenses, including Social Security and interest on debt.With the US national debt now exceeding $36 trillion, and a budget deficit of $1.4 trillion this fiscal year, the government continues to borrow to make up the difference. The added tariff revenue has helped narrow the deficit slightly, reducing the amount of new borrowing needed.“It’s not like there’s a better use for the money,” said Brett Ryan, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank, in a comment to CNN.A bill introduced recently by Republican Senator Josh Hawley proposes distributing “tariff rebate checks” to Americans. However, economists warn that this move could backfire.“They’re the wrong policy to pursue right now,” said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale and a former economist in the Biden White House, noting that such payouts could fuel inflation.While the government sees a financial boost, the economic pain isn’t invisible. Many businesses have absorbed the higher costs, but not all. Prices for items like appliances, toys, and electronics, which are sensitive to import costs, have been rising, according to recent government inflation data.Major retailers such as Walmart and Procter & Gamble have already issued warnings about upcoming price increases.The uncertainty around trade policy has also had broader implications. Economic surveys indicate that businesses are more cautious about hiring, leading to fewer job openings.“Tariffs are going to have a negative economic effect on the American economy,” Tedeschi said. The Yale Budget Lab estimates the tariffs could reduce US GDP by 0.5 percentage points this year and next, as per CNN.While tariff revenue may offer short-term gains, a slower-growing economy could offset these by reducing income and payroll tax revenue in the long run.Despite the concerns, Trump and his advisers remain optimistic. They argue that the combination of tax cuts, tariff income, and government spending will ultimately strengthen the US economy.","US President Donald Trump frequently boasts about the billions of dollars flowing into the US government’s coffers from sweeping tariffs.

The US trade deficit shrank sharply in June to $60.2 billion, marking a 16% decline from the revised $71.7 billion recorded in May, according to data released Tuesday by the Department of Commerce.The unexpected contraction in the world’s largest economy’s trade gap was driven primarily by a steep drop in imports, as President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs began to bite, AFP reported.Imports fell 3.7% month-on-month to $337.5 billion, with consumer goods leading the retreat, down by $8.4 billion. Industrial supplies and materials also fell by $2.7 billion, while auto and parts imports declined by $1.3 billion.Exports also saw a marginal 0.5% decline to $277.3 billion, with outbound shipments of industrial supplies down by $1.3 billion.Analysts attributed the shrinkage to reduced foreign purchases amid rising costs, as Trump’s administration enforced a 10% duty on most trading partners in April. The US has also imposed higher tariffs on steel, aluminium, and automobiles, fuelling cost pressures on businesses.The data also showed the goods trade deficit with China narrowed by $4.6 billion to $9.4 billion in June. This came against the backdrop of escalating tit-for-tat tariffs between Washington and Beijing since April, which briefly reached triple-digit levels before both sides agreed in May to lower duties temporarily until August 12.","The US trade deficit shrank sharply in June to $60.2 billion, marking a 16% decline from the revised $71.7 billion recorded in May.

White House Calls EU-U.S. Deal A Trump Masterstroke That Will Change The World For Next 100 Years

In a major step towards easing trade tensions, the European Union announced on Tuesday that it will suspend its planned retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth 93 billion euros ($107 billion).The move follows a deal struck last month between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.EU trade spokesperson Olof Gill confirmed the suspension: “The Commission has today adopted the necessary legal procedures to suspend the implementation of our EU countermeasures, which were due to kick in on August 7.”The suspension of tariffs marks a significant concession from the 27-member bloc, one of America’s biggest trading partners.The pause is expected to last six months, reports CNBC. It comes after weeks of negotiations between Trump and von der Leyen over tariff disputes and broader trade issues.“On 27 July 2025, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Donald J. Trump agreed a deal on tariffs and trade,” the EU Commission spokesperson for trade had said in a statement.The EU described the agreement as one that restores “stability and predictability for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.”The Commission also said it would “continue to work with the US to finalise a Joint Statement, as agreed on 27 July.”As part of the deal, Trump announced 15 per cent tariffs on most European goods entering the US. In return, the EU pledged to remove several trade barriers, including the elimination of all EU tariffs on US industrial exports.The White House also claimed the EU would buy $750 billion worth of US energy and invest another $600 billion into the American economy. However, questions remain over how these commitments will be fulfilled, as the EU cannot mandate private companies to make such purchases.The EU has clarified that the July deal is a political agreement and “not legally binding.”A senior EU official said both sides were working on the details of the leaders' agreement and hoped to share more information ""very, very soon"".An EU official also warned that the suspension could be reversed if talks break down. ""We put it back into the freezer and we can always take it out if needed, so we can always unsuspend the suspension,"" the senior EU official said.Following the deal, EU exports will face a 15 per cent tariff starting August 8. This rate is higher than it was before Trump returned to the White House but still much lower than the 30 per cent he had earlier threatened.",The EU will suspend its planned retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth 93 billion euros ($107 billion) The move follows a deal struck last month between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), introduced a significant update to its Policy Manual, specifically targeting marriage fraud in family-based immigrant visa petitions.The critical update to its Policy Manual titled ‘Family-Based Immigrants', released August 1, is designed to ensure that only genuine relationships, particularly bona fide marriages, qualify for lawful permanent resident (green card) status in the US.This measure aims to prevent fraudulent applications and strengthen the integrity of the immigration process. The USCIS stated that thorough verification processes will be implemented to assess the authenticity of relationships submitted for immigration purposes.The USCIS took this firm stance in response to rising concerns that ""fraudulent, frivolous, or otherwise non‑meritorious"" immigration applications are undermining public confidence in family-based immigration and posing national security risks.USCIS explicitly stated its commitment to ""robust alien screening and vetting that protects Americans from potential national security threats"" and to ""detecting aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the US.""Additionally, there have been cases involving Indian nationals caught in marriage fraud. According to a recent release by the US Attorney’s Office, in May 2025, Indian national Aakash Prakash Makwana pleaded guilty to marriage fraud. He overstayed his J-1 visa, arranged a fake marriage with a US citizen, fabricated rental and utility records to feign cohabitation, and falsely claimed domestic abuse to obtain a green card.Upon being convicted of marriage fraud, an individual faces significant prison time, fines, and deportation.The updated policy mandates more comprehensive evidence of bona fide marriages, including photographs, financial documents, and affidavits from acquaintances. Couples may face rigorous interviews to verify the authenticity of their relationship. The USCIS will scrutinize any history of multiple applications by a US citizen for different spouses or prior applications for the same beneficiary, flagging them for detailed investigation.USCIS may issue a Notice to Appear if the beneficiary is found removable due to ineligibility or fraudulent intent.Additionally, according to an earlier report, marrying a US citizen or green card holder no longer guarantees a smooth path to a green card. Immigration interviews are now stricter, with officers demanding more proof of a genuine relationship- from photos and call logs to joint finances and shared plans.Spouses abroad face rigorous consular interviews, while those in the US may be called for “Stokes interviews,” where couples are questioned separately. Long wait times, especially for green card holder spouses, raise additional red flags.Immigration lawyers advise treating the process like an exam: prepare thoroughly, bring evidence, and be ready for personal questions. A weak case could mean denial — or even deportation proceedings.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), introduced a significant update to its Policy Manual, specifically targeting marriage fraud in family-based immigrant visa petitions.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

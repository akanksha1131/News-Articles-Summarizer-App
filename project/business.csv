Cash gifts under tax net: What helped prove the genuineness?

The gift transactions were considered credible as they occurred between biological sisters, demonstrating natural familial bonds and care.

Both sisters provided clear evidence of their funding sources - one through documented property sale earnings whilst the other through verified bank records.

All transactions were properly authenticated and one was specifically processed through proper banking channels.

The Revenue Department's failure to conduct proper verification, despite having access to all necessary information, meant the assessee could not be held responsible for any perceived shortcomings in the inquiry.

The documentation reviewed by the Tribunal included:

Gift declarations and confirmations from both sisters;

Sale deeds proving Smt. Bansal's receipt of sale proceeds;

Bank statements from donors demonstrating fund availability and transfers;

The assessee's bank statements validating the receipts.





Gifts received from relatives and friends can sometimes land you in the Income Tax Department's scrutiny net. One such case was of a Mr. Maheshwari from Agra, who had to prove the genuineness of Rs 10 lakh received as cash from his sisters.According to an ET report, a businessman from Agra, Mr. Maheshwari, said he received Rs 2.74 crore (2,74,33,250) as a gift from his Delhi-based sister, along with Rs 6.25 lakh from another sister. Both sisters were married, and he utilised these funds in his business ventures. He subsequently filed his income tax return (ITR) for AY 2016-17, declaring an income of Rs 10 lakh (10,80,770).His ITR faced scrutiny after receiving a notice under Section 143(2) on September 19, 2017. The income tax assessing officer (AO) documented in the assessment order that Mr. Maheshwari earned income as a firm partner. The officer observed a capital increase of Rs 1.8 crore (1,83,77,061) during AY 2016-17.During the investigation, Mr. Maheshwari clarified that he had introduced capital of Rs 3.67 lakh and Rs 1.8 crore into his proprietorship firms. He attributed this to his Delhi-based sister's gift of Rs 2.74 crore (2,74,33,250), which she had declared in her ITR.He additionally reported receiving Rs 6,25,000 in gifts from his other sister. Whilst he provided documentation to demonstrate the donors' financial capability, the tax officer questioned certain transactions. These included two Rs 5,00,000 gifts received on April 15, 2015, and May 15, 2015, from his Delhi sister, plus the Rs 6,25,000 from his other sister, citing insufficient documentation.Also Read | PPF rules: Why Kerala High Court ordered a mother to return extra interest earned in children’s Public Provident Fund accounts - explained The tax official deemed these gift amounts as a deliberate arrangement to evade taxation under the Income Tax Act and categorised them as unexplained cash credit under Section 68 during assessment, the ET report said.The Agra resident challenged this decision by filing an appeal with the Commissioner of Appeals (CIT A).The CIT A confirmed the tax official's classification of the Rs 10,94,000 gift from the Delhi-based sister as unexplained cash credit under Section 68, citing insufficient evidence of the donor's financial capacity. Dissatisfied with this decision, the individual approached the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Agra bench. On September 30, 2025, the ITAT Agra ruled in his favour, the report said.The brother's success in the case stemmed from providing comprehensive documentary proof that validated both the authenticity of the gifts and the financial capacity of the donors.According to the ET report, the Tribunal's findings were:Also Read | Six years after receiving salary arrears, retired employees were told to repay the entire amount - until this Supreme Court ruling changed everything The ITAT Agra ruled that the Section 68 additions were unwarranted, deciding in the assessee's favour by accepting the gifts as legitimate and properly explained.ITAT Agra's judgement (ITA No. 316/AGR/2024) dated September 30, 2025, acknowledged that the assessee's lawyers highlighted a sale deed showing his Delhi-based sister had received cash from a property sale, which she subsequently gifted to him. The tribunal noted that their sibling relationship was undisputed.ITAT Agra said: ""The factum of a sister giving a gift to brother is also supported by confirmation. Hence in my considered opinion, the source of the donor is also established by the assessee herein in the instant case.""The tribunal noted that the assessee confirmed his sister had properly paid capital gains tax on the property sale.ITAT Agra observed that the CIT (A) had pointed out the Delhi Sister's returns weren't scrutinised under Section 143(3).ITAT Agra declared: ""This cannot be a reason to disbelieve the gift and doubt the creditworthiness of her. Income Tax is not in the assessee's (brother) hands as to get her returns scrutinized. That job is left to the wisdom of the income tax department. The assessee cannot be faulted for an act which is not in his control. Hence there is no reason to disbelieve her creditworthiness to have given a cash gift of Rs 10,94,000 to the assessee (brother) and accordingly the same is to be treated as explained. ""Chartered Accountant (Dr.) Suresh Surana told ET that the Tribunal's assessment confirmed that both donors were the assessee's biological sisters, validating the familial bond appropriate for such gifts. The source of Smt. Bansal's cash gifts was adequately substantiated through property sale proceeds. The Tribunal specified that the absence of scrutiny of her return under Section 143(3) was not sufficient grounds to question her creditworthiness, as this responsibility falls under the Income Tax Department's jurisdiction rather than the assessee's.Surana notes that regarding Smt. Agarwal's case, the Tribunal determined that the gift transfer occurred through proper banking channels, supported by bank records and gift confirmation. The Tribunal concluded that the assessee had adequately fulfilled obligations under Section 68, demonstrating the donor's identity, creditworthiness, and transaction authenticity, particularly since the Assessing Officer did not pursue additional donor investigations despite having complete information.","A businessman from Agra had to prove the genuineness of Rs 10 lakh received as cash from his sisters.

'Prospects Damaged': Russia Slams Trump Sanctions; Rules Out Immediate End To Ukraine War

India’s Exports Basket: The Rise of iPhones

The commerce ministry's half-yearly export data reveals that electronics exports grew by 42% hitting $22.2 billion, with Apple's iPhones contributing approximately half of this value, compared to $15.6 billion in the previous year.

Commerce ministry data shows that electronics exports have firmly established themselves as the nation's third-largest and most rapidly expanding overseas sales segment during the first half of FY26. Experts told ET that with limitations on Russian oil procurement, electronics could rise to the second position behind engineering products within two years.

The electronics sector was at the seventh position in export rankings during FY22.

For the year concluding in March, electronics emerged as the fastest-growing category amongst the top 10. Subsequently, its growth has intensified, achieving the highest growth rate across all 30 export categories in the first six months of FY26.

Electronics advanced to the third position, surpassing gems and jewellery and chemicals in FY25. Previously, it had moved from seventh position in FY22, overtaking drugs and pharmaceuticals and readymade garments sectors.

On the other hand, petroleum products saw a decline of 16.4%, dropping to $30.6 billion from $36.6 billion. Despite remaining India's second-largest export category, petroleum has shown a consistent decline from $97.4 billion in FY23 to $63.3 billion in FY25.

Engineering maintained its leadership with $59.3 billion, showing a 5.35% increase from $56.3 billion in the previous year.

The electronics sector has seen substantial growth over three years, with exports increasing by 63% from $23.5 billion in FY23 to $38.5 billion in FY25.

Electronics Exports - Rising through the ranks

The Decline of Oil Exports





The booming Apple iPhone production in India, and the latest sanctions on Russian oil firms by Donald Trump, may power electronics to become the second most-shipped exports category in India. It’s a story of rise in electronics exports and a likely fall in India’s oil exports as US sanctions may hit the flow of discounted Russian crude.According to an ET report, electronics exports are projected to surpass petroleum products as India's second-highest export category, following US sanctions that could hit Indian refiners' Russian crude purchases.""At the current rate, electronics exports will double from FY23 to FY26,"" an analyst was quoted as saying.Export analysts indicate that oil shipments could experience a steeper downturn following US sanctions on discounted Russian crude, eliminating the price benefit for Indian refiners.""The exports were going down despite the cost advantage due to Russian oil for the past few years. When this advantage is no longer available, the exports may suffer more,"" noted a sector specialist.The differential between petroleum, ranked second, and electronics during the first six months reduced from $73.9 billion when the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme commenced to $24.7 billion in FY25.This gap is projected to further contract to $16 billion in FY26, according to industry observers.Whilst petroleum products will maintain the third position in FY26, electronics could potentially overtake petroleum as India's second-highest export category by FY28, based on current growth trajectories. However, this progression largely hinges on the evolution of India's oil trade in relation to the US administration's position regarding Russian oil.Electronics exports have dominated China's trade portfolio for many years. Given the current global geopolitical shifts that are encouraging multinational companies to diversify their manufacturing bases, India is strategising to establish electronics as its core competency, according to industry specialists.The Production Linked Incentive scheme for smartphones has significantly boosted electronics exports, with major players like Apple, Samsung and domestic manufacturer Dixon Technologies leveraging financial benefits to enhance production and overseas sales. India has emerged as Apple's secondary manufacturing hub after China for iPhone production. Notably, Indian-manufactured iPhones now constitute more than 20% of global iPhone shipments.During the first half of the current fiscal year, Apple's iPhone exports reached an unprecedented $10 billion. These shipments represented over 75% of the total smartphone exports valued at $13.4 billion and contributed 45% to the overall electronics exports of $22.2 billion.","Electronics exports have firmly established themselves as the nation's third- largest and most rapidly expanding overseas sales segment.

Gold price prediction: Gold prices are likely to trade with a lower bias in the coming days, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Here is his outlook for gold prices in the coming days: Last week, Gold, after recording its biggest weekly gain in five years amid global uncertainty and trade tensions, witnessed a sharp fall along with silver, which plunged over 5% in a single session as investors booked profits following a strong rally earlier this year. Market sentiment turned cautious amid prospects of a cease-fire between Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas, although continued attacks in the Middle East kept geopolitical risks elevated.US President Trump’s request for Ukraine to accept Russia’s deal and his comments ruling out a 100% tariff on Chinese goods added to global speculation, while expectations of a meeting with President Xi Jinping fuelled hopes of easing US-China tensions. After COMEX gold neared $4,400 and silver soared over 85% YTD, markets corrected sharply as margin calls and a firmer dollar index triggered panic selling.Nonetheless, concerns around the Fed’s independence, political instability, and persistent geopolitical unrest continue to support strategic buying in bullion. Amidst US shutdown major economic data points are delayed however, US inflation print was released slightly lower than expectations providing an immediate support to bullions.This week along with further talks between the US and China, the Fed policy meeting is also scheduled where a 25 bps cut is expected by the market. Any comments from Governor Powell during the meeting suggesting a data dependent approach or a cautious tone could further weigh on prices. Along with that, any change in the tone from the weekend positivity between US and China could put a cap on the lower side.","Gold prices are likely to trade with a lower bias in the coming days, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

What does Kerala High Court ruling mean for your PPF deposits?





Public Provident Fund or PPF is a popular savings scheme with the sovereign guarantee and a decent rate of return adding to its charm. It is specially seen as a safe bet for risk averse investors. But there is a cap to the annual investment in the scheme - if you end up earning interest on any extra contribution made over and above this limit, then you will have to return that amount. Here’s a Kerala High Court judgment to better understand this:On 22 March 1999, three public provident fund accounts were opened by a mother at the post office, including one for herself and two for her children. She consistently made deposits into all three PPF accounts. The first child attained majority on 24 December 2005, whilst the second child turned 18 on 26 September 2007. Despite her children becoming adults, she continued making deposits into the PPF accounts as and when possible.According to an ET report, in 2017, the Post Office dispatched a letter dated 29 September 2017, notifying the mother that the aggregate amount in the three PPF accounts exceeded the prescribed limit under the Public Provident Fund Scheme 1968, as the accounts were opened when the children were minors.Consequently, the Post Office recovered Rs 6,87,021 in accumulated interest from all three PPF accounts.Dissatisfied with this action, the mother initiated a Writ Petition before the Kerala High Court. Whilst a Single bench Judge ruled in favour of the petition, the Post Office subsequently challenged this decision before a division bench of the Kerala High Court.On August 14, 2025, the Kerala High Court scrutinised both the single bench judge's ruling and the Public Provident Fund Act 1968, the ET report said.The court noted that the mother had opened three PPF Accounts on March 22, 1999, including one for herself and two separate accounts for her first and second children.According to Rule 3 of Public Provident Fund Act 1968, there exists a yearly deposit ceiling of Rs 1 lakh for an individual, which includes both their personal account and accounts opened for minors under their guardianship, as stipulated in Rule 3(1) of the Scheme. This limit has seen periodic increases.The court concluded that under Rule 3, any deposits exceeding the limit made into these minor accounts before they reached adulthood would be considered as the mother's deposits, thereby violating the prescribed limit under Rule 3 of the Public Provident Fund Act 1968.The High Court of Kerala presented specific portions of the Provident Fund Act, 1968, highlighting the following:Rule 3 from Scheme 1968, along with its associated clarification, states:- ""3. Limit of subscription:- (1) Any individual may, on his own behalf or on behalf of a minor of whom he is the guardian, subscribe to the Public Provident Fund (thereafter referred to as the fund) any amount not less than Rs 500 and not more than Rs 1,50,000 in a year.”- “(3) The limit of deposit of 1,00,000 in a year by an individual in his selfaccount and accounts opened by him on behalf of his minor(s) of whom he is the guardian is combined under rule 3 (1) of the Scheme. This limit is separate for accounts opened by the HUF or an association of persons or body of individuals vide rule 3 (2) of the scheme.""Section 3 empowers the Central Government to establish and implement the Public Provident Fund Scheme through Official Gazette notification. It authorises the creation of a provident fund accessible to the general public. The section stipulates that the Scheme can encompass matters detailed in the Schedule whilst overriding other existing laws except this Act. Additionally, the Central Government retains authority to modify, supplement or alter the Scheme via Official Gazette notifications, according to the ET report.Section 4 specifies that individuals may contribute to the Fund, either for themselves or as guardians of minors. These contributions must comply with the maximum and minimum limits prescribed within the Scheme framework.Following the analysis of account documents, the court determined that the total forfeited interest amounting to Rs 6,87,021 pertained solely to the minor accounts until they reached legal age.Subsequently, the operations of these accounts continued with regular payments and interest disbursements by the appellants to the respondents. There remains no contention regarding the interest disbursements following the attainment of majority age.Source: ETThe interest forfeiture spans distinct periods for each child: for the first child from March 20, 2002 to March 16, 2005, whilst for the second child from March 20, 2002 to March 24, 2007.Source: ETThe Kerala High Court has clarified that under Scheme 1968, when a mother manages and makes deposits into her minor children's accounts, the combined deposits across all three accounts will be considered together for the prescribed scheme limits.Analysis of the presented charts reveals annual breaches of established limits. The Post Office (appellants) failed to identify these irregularities until an internal audit in 2017 brought them to light. The court noted that paying interest above the prescribed limits constitutes unfair enrichment and places an unnecessary burden on public funds.The Kerala High Court's ruling on PPF accounts has substantial ramifications, particularly concerning accounts initiated by guardians for minor children, as explained by Gyanendra Mishra, Partner at Dentons Link Legal to ET.Gyanendra Mishra believes that the ruling definitively establishes the principle of deposit clubbing, with several key implications for investors:The verdict confirms that statutory deposit limits must account for both guardian and minor's PPF accounts collectively. The combined yearly deposits must not surpass the limits set by the PPF Scheme, 1968.The court affirmed that postal authorities have the legal right to recover interest earned on deposits exceeding annual limits.The ruling precisely outlines when clubbing rules are applicable. Interest forfeiture applies exclusively to excess deposits made whilst the account holder was a minor. Deposits and interest accrued post-majority remain unaffected, with accounts then considered autonomous.This verdict, which supersedes a previous Single Judge's ruling favouring the investor, establishes a clear legal framework. It alerts guardians managing PPF accounts for minor children to monitor their cumulative annual contributions across associated accounts to prevent penalties.Mishra says: ""In summary, the judgment's primary significance is that it removes any ambiguity regarding the treatment of a minor's PPF account. It confirms that such an account is considered an extension of the guardian's account for the purpose of the annual deposit limit, and any violation can lead to a lawful forfeiture of the interest earned on excess contributions.""Deepak Kumar, Partner at Khaitan & Co told ET that there is a pressing need for PPF regulatory bodies and relevant authorities to inform individuals about both benefits and restrictions of PPF accounts opened for their minor children. Regular advisories should be issued warning against over-contributions, as these can result in substantial financial losses owing to interest forfeitures on amounts exceeding legally prescribed limits, he adds.","Public Provident Fund or PPF is a popular savings scheme with a decent rate of return. It is specially seen as a safe bet for risk averse investors. But there is a cap to the annual investment in the scheme - if you end up earning interest on any extra contribution made over and above this limit, then you will have to return that amount.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124823759,imgsize-78838,width-400,resizemode-4/ppf-rules.jpg"

‘Indians Are Very Mature…’: US State Secy Marco Rubio’s Big Remark On US-Pakistan Ties





External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday in Kuala Lumpur to discuss international relations and ongoing trade negotiations between their nations.The discussions were held alongside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit events in the Malaysian capital.""Glad to meet @SecRubio this morning in Kuala Lumpur. Appreciated the discussion on our bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues,"" Jaishankar posted on X.This encounter occurred as India and the US are finalising a proposed bilateral trade agreement, which officials indicate is approaching completion. Last week, union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal emphasized that India would not rush into any trade agreements or accept terms from partner countries that might restrict its ""trading choices.""Goyal pointed out that trade agreements are about more than just ""tariffs or market access"" adding that they focus on building ""trust, long-term relationships, and creating sustainable frameworks for global business cooperation.""He stressed that New Delhi would maintain a cautious and balanced approach. Alluding to discussions with Washington, he remarked, ""In a very short-term context, it's not about what is going to happen in the next six months. It's not just about being able to sell steel to America."" Goyal further explained that India's trade strategy is driven by a long-term vision rather than short-term objectives, stating, ""Trade deals are for a longer duration. It's not only about tariffs, it's also about trust and a relationship. Trade deals are also about businesses."" Reflecting this approach, Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal mentioned on Friday that trade negotiations between India and the US are ""progressing well,"" with both parties ""converging"" on most issues, suggesting that a mutually beneficial agreement may be near. ""I think we are very close,"" Agrawal said, referring to the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former US President Donald Trump on February 13.The two nations have completed five rounds of discussions for the initial phase of their trade agreement.Prior to this, on Sunday, Jaishankar engaged in individual conversations with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Thailand's Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow.ASEAN, comprising 11 nations, stands as a significant regional organisation, engaging with various dialogue partners including India, the US, China, Japan and Australia.","External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday in Kuala Lumpur.

(AI image)

Gold prices are likely to remain under pressure ahead of the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

The analyst shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

On October 27, spot gold tumbled below the psychologically crucial $4000 level on trade optimism as US and China trade negotiating teams said that they have reached a trade deal framework on multiple trade issues ahead of the much-anticipated Trump-Xi meeting scheduled for October 30.

At the time of writing this article, the spot gold was trading at $3986, down over 3% for the day, while the MCX December gold contract at Rs 120,546 was down by 2.35%.

Earlier, in the week ending October 24, the shiny metal tumbled 3.29% to $4112; thus, posting its first weekly loss in ten weeks.

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

US-China trade truce:

The US and China, after two-day talk in Malaysia, have reportedly reached a preliminary consensus on issues like export controls, fentanyl and shipping levies.

US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that the proposed 100% tariff on China is off the table now and differences over the sale of Tik Tok could be resolved.

He was optimistic that China will delay its latest rare earth controls for a year. It is to be noted that rare earths are needed to produce advanced products ranging from semiconductors to defence equipment.

China is expected to start buying US soybeans that it had stopped before the harvest season.

Trump and Xi are set to finalize the deals as the former said that he expects a good deal with China, adding that additional leader-level follow-up meetings may happen in China and the US.

Data roundup:

The much-awaited US CPI report (September) released on Friday showed cooler-than-expected readings across-the-board as headline CPI rose 0.3% m-o-m (forecast 0.4%, prior 0.4%). Core CPI rose 0.2% m-o-m (forecast 0.3%, prior 0.3%). The headline CPI was up 3% y-o-y (forecast 3.1%, prior 2.9%), while core CPI rose 3% y-o-y (forecast 3.1%, prior 3.1%). CPI inflation clearly running well-above the Fed's target of 2%; however, data coming in cooler-than-expected and remaining around the recent ranges as tariff passthrough is slow, sealed the Fed rate cut in October. Traders have almost fully priced in a 25-bps rate cut in December, too.

S&P US Composite PMI (Oct. prel.) came in at 54.80 Vs the forecast of 53.50 on stellar services and manufacturing PMIs.

University of Michigan (October final) came in at 53.60 Vs the forecast of 54.50 (prior data 55) as current conditions also deteriorated. One-year inflation expectations, although quite elevated at 4.6%, matched the median estimate, while 5-10 year-inflation expectations at 3.9% were hotter than the expectation of 3.7% (prior 3.7%).

LBMA conference:

The London Bullion Market Association's conference started on Sunday in Kyoto, Japan. The Conference would be attended by gold traders, brokers, and refiners.

John Reade, market strategist at World Gold Council, said at the LBMA conference that central bank demand is not as strong as it was earlier. He added that his conversation with traders reflected that gold prices may have to fall further after a steep rally in the last three months.

Gold ETFs:

Total known global gold ETF holdings fell for the third straight day to 98.19Moz as of October 24, as ETF holdings witnessed the first net weekly outflow after eight consecutive weeks of net positive inflows.

Nonetheless, ETF holdings continue to hover around 3-year high as holdings have risen 15.62% YTD.

US Dollar Index and US yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index at 98.06 was down nearly 0.1% for the day.

Ten-year US yields at 4.015% were up 1.5 bps, while 2-year yields rose 3 bps to 3.51%.

Moody's changes the sovereign debt outlook for France to negative:

The rating agency Moody's changed the French sovereign debt outlook to negative due to political instability that may culminate into a faster weakening of the nation's key fiscal parameters, though it retained its Aa3 rating.

Upcoming data and events:

Major US data on tap this week include US Conference Board consumer confidence (October 28), advance goods trade balance (Oct. 29), 3Q advance GDP and Core PCE Price Index QoQ (Oct. 30) and September PCE Price Index (October 31) – the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation.

The Eurozone's 3Q GDP data will be released on Oct. 30.

This week is packed with monetary policy decisions of key central banks. The US FOMC is expected to cut the overnight Fed Fund rate by 25 bps in its monetary policy due on October 29.

Bank of Canada is widely expected to cut rates by 25 bps to 2.25% on October 29 as the growth falters amid tariff wars.

The European Central Bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged in its policy to be announced on October 31, as core inflation is running at 2.3% y-o-y.

Similarly, the Bank of Japan is expected to stand pat on its interest rate in its monetary policy decision due on October 30.

Gold Price Outlook:

Gold is expected to remain under pressure ahead of the Trump--Xi meeting on October 30 as trade deal optimism takes CenterStage.

While there may be further progress on some sectoral issues through talks between the US and China, key issues like national security, state subsidies, technical race and Trump's agenda of financial imbalance remain unresolved. In addition, in a contentious development, the US is launching a trade investigation into whether China fully implemented its commitments under the phase one agreement and will be deciding on required actions.

Gold is likely to be under pressure in the near-term as bears eye the test of support around $3822. Interim support is around $3950. Fed rate cut expectations will limit the downside.

Resistance is noted around $4160/$4200.

On a long-term horizon, we look for a target of $5,000 by the end of 2026 and suggest accumulating the metal in downward correction.

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver is vulnerable after falling through the support zone of $47.50-$47.80. However, it is looking quite oversold after falling nearly 15% from its peak of $54.49.

US-China trade truce will be positive for the metal. Although downside pressure persists, we suggest accumulating the metal for medium to long term.

Support is at $45.70, followed by $44. Resistance is at $47.80/$48.50.

'Govt wants to prevent monopoly'





NEW DELHI: The Union govt on Monday convinced the Supreme Court to permit the department of telecom to review its demand of Rs 6,000 crore additional adjusted gross revenue demand for the FY 2016-17 on Vodafone-Idea.Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran was informed by solicitor general Tushar Mehta that since the previous round of litigation, in which Vodafone was ordered to pay the AGR dues, there had been a change of circumstance as the Centre has acquired a 49% stake in the company. Mehta said, ""We do not want the company, in which the govt has a huge investment, to go bankrupt to make 20 crore people suffer.Govt wants more players in the mobile telecom sector to prevent monopoly,"" said solicitor general Tushar Mehta. Vodafone through senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi had argued that the SC had frozen the AGR dues at Rs 58,254 crore as of 2016-17 and that the DoT cannot raise additional AGR dues in breach of the SC order. Govt had converted Rs 36,950 cr dues as its 49% equity in the telecom service provider.The bench noticed the element of public interest in the case and permitted the Centre to take a fresh view of the additional AGR demands, especially when the issue is purely in the policy domain and involves the interests of 20 crore people. ""We see no reason why the Centre should be prevented from taking a relook at the additional AGR dues,"" the bench said.","Govt wants more players in the mobile telecom sector to prevent monopoly,"" said solicitor general Tushar Mehta.

Dhanteras 2025:

But will this rally continue? Are gold and silver good investment bets over the next year? We ask experts what the gold and silver price outlook is and what levels will they hit by Dhanteras 2026:

Dhanteras 2025: Should you buy gold and silver this year?

What’s the gold price outlook till next Dhanteras?

Gold — Diwali/Dhanteras 2026 target: ₹1,40,000–₹1,45,000+ Bull case 160000+ if geopolitical risk escalates or Fed turns very dovish. For the 12-month horizon to Dhanteras 2026, maintaining the bullish structural view, expect upside if the macro tailwinds persist — Fed cuts, weak dollar, tariffs/ geopolitical premium.Since the price has shown sharp up move recently, its advisable to allocate in dips and parts.

Silver — Dhanteras/Diwali 2026 target: ₹1,85,000–₹2,10,000/kg; Bull case ₹2,20,000–₹2,50,000+ on stronger industrial demand Central banks buying and continued ETF flows.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"
"‘Golden Age’: US, Japan sign agreement on 'securing' supply of rare earths; ahead of Donald Trump's meeting with Xi Jinping",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/golden-age-us-japan-sign-agreement-on-securing-supply-of-rare-earths-ahead-of-donald-trumps-meeting-with-xi-jinping/articleshow/124862151.cms,"Xi Flexes Nuke Muscle Before Meeting Trump; H-6k Bombers, J-10 Jets Drop Missiles | 'TAIWAN VISIBLE'

The rare earth standoff



Message to Xi?







The United States and Japan have signed a new deal aimed at securing supplies of critical minerals and rare earths, as President Donald Trump hailed a “golden age” in relations with Tokyo. The agreement, signed during Trump’s visit to Japan on Tuesday, reflects a growing effort by Washington to reduce its dependence on China for vital resources that power everything from electric cars to fighter jets.According to the White House, the framework is designed to ensure “resilience and security of critical minerals and rare earths supply chains.” The pact comes just days after Trump announced similar memoranda of understanding with Malaysia and Thailand, marking a coordinated push to diversify sources of rare earth materials across the Indo-Pacific.Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s first female leader, hosted Trump at Tokyo’s Akasaka Palace. “This is the greatest alliance in the world,” she said, pledging to build a “new golden era” in US-Japan relations. Trump returned the praise, calling her leadership a “big deal” and promising that “anything I can do to help Japan, we will be there.”The Tokyo deal comes at a tense moment in the global race for rare earth dominance.China controls around 70 per cent of global mining and nearly 90 per cent of refining capacity for these elements, which are essential for advanced technologies including smartphones, electric vehicles and military aircraft.Beijing recently expanded export controls, requiring government approval for any products containing even trace amounts of rare earths. The move, described by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as “China pointing a bazooka at the world’s supply chains,” reignited tensions after months of calm between the two powers.Trump’s counter-strategy has been to build alliances to weaken Beijing’s grip. In Kuala Lumpur earlier this week, he signed deals with Malaysia and Thailand to bolster production and exports of critical minerals, following an $8.5 billion US-Australia framework agreement. “In about a year from now, we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earths, and you won’t know what to do with them,” Trump said confidently on Monday.Experts, however, warn that such optimism may be premature. “China is too far ahead of the world,” said John Mavrogenes, professor of economic geology at the Australian National University, who estimated that alternative supply chains could take a decade to fully develop.Beyond its economic implications, Tuesday’s signing ceremony was rich in symbolism. Trump and Takaichi also inked a brief one-page declaration heralding the “golden age” of their nations’ alliance — a gesture intended to reaffirm America’s strategic commitment to Japan as both countries navigate the shifting power balance in Asia.The deal also arrives days before Trump’s expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, where trade and rare earths are likely to dominate talks. Analysts say the new Japan agreement sends a clear signal to Beijing that Washington is working to fortify supply lines with trusted allies.“By building alternative networks, the US increases its leverage in negotiations with China,” Charles Chang of Fudan University told South China Morning Post. “Even if production takes time, it changes the dynamics.”Takaichi, a protégé of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, presented the US president with gestures of goodwill — 250 cherry trees for America’s 250th anniversary and fireworks from Akita Prefecture for the 4 July celebrations — reinforcing the sense of friendship amid hard-nosed diplomacy.","President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi signed a new deal aimed at securing supplies of critical minerals and rare earths.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Monday cautioned against rising “unilateralism” in global trade, urging nations not to revert to “the law of the jungle” amid escalating tariff tensions with the United States.Speaking at the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Li said economic globalization and multipolarity were “irreversible,” calling for stronger support for the global free trade system. He warned that unilateralism and protectionism were “rampant” and posed “huge risks to the region.”His remarks came ahead of a key meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, scheduled for Thursday in South Korea, where both leaders are expected to discuss ways to ease their ongoing trade disputes.Li’s comments were seen as a veiled criticism of Trump’s tariff policies, which have disrupted global trade networks and financial markets, as reported by AFP.Meanwhile, speaking to reporters while en route to Japan, Trump expressed optimism about reaching an agreement with Xi during their upcoming talks. It will mark the first face-to-face talks between the two leaders since Donald Trump began his second term in January.Many hope the meeting will help ease tensions between the world’s two largest economies.The trade conflict between Washington and Beijing has intensified since Trump announced sweeping tariffs earlier this year. Both sides have been negotiating to avert another round of 100 per cent tariffs set to take effect on November 1.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng held two days of talks over the weekend, with both sides reporting progress. China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang said a “preliminary consensus” had been reached, while Bessent told ABC News that the additional tariffs had been “effectively averted.”He added that the two countries were close to finalising agreements on rare earth exports and American soybean trade.","Chinese Premier Li Qiang warns against rising ""unilateralism"" in global trade.

US stocks advanced on Monday, pushing further into record territory ahead of a week filled with major market-moving events—including a Federal Reserve policy decision and a highly anticipated meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping By mid-morning, the S&P 500 was up 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 254 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.5%. All three indexes extended the all-time highs they reached on Friday.The rally follows strong gains in Asian markets, where optimism grew ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting set for Thursday. Investors hope the discussions will ease trade tensions and support global growth. Trump said, “We feel good” about working things out with China, as quoted by AP.The S&P 500 has surged 37.6% since its April low, fueled by expectations of lower interest rates, easing trade concerns, and robust corporate earnings. The focus now turns to the Fed’s policy meeting on Wednesday, where traders broadly expect a second consecutive quarter-point rate cut aimed at supporting a cooling job market.Still, uncertainty lingers. The Fed has signaled that it could alter course if inflation rises more quickly than expected.A recent inflation report came in slightly better than forecasts, but the ongoing US government shutdown may delay further data, leaving the outlook for rate cuts unclear.Corporate earnings have also played a major role in sustaining the market’s momentum. Keurig Dr Pepper gained 6.9% after posting quarterly profit in line with expectations, citing stronger K-Cup pricing. Investors are now looking ahead to a string of big-tech earnings this week, with Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft due to report Wednesday, followed by Amazon and Apple on Thursday.Mergers and acquisitions added to the upbeat sentiment. Cadence Bank jumped 5.1% after Huntington Bancshares announced a $7.4 billion all-stock deal to acquire it, though Huntington shares slipped 2.1%. Avidity Biosciences surged 42.6% after Novartis agreed to buy the San Diego-based firm for $12 billion following the spin-off of its early-stage precision cardiology programs reported AP.Global markets echoed Wall Street’s optimism. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rallied 2.5%, topping the 50,000 mark for the first time, as public support strengthened for new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s market-friendly policies.

Madoff's investment fraud: HSBC books $1.1 billion provision; shares dip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/madoffs-investment-fraud-hsbc-books-1-1-billion-provision-shares-dip/articleshow/124853430.cms,"HSBC Bank books $1.1 billion provision





HSBC Bank on Monday disclosed a financial charge of $1.1 billion related to a claim by a European fund tied to the late Bernard Madoff’s investment fraud.The provision will be reflected in the lender’s third-quarter results due Tuesday, the London-headquartered bank said. Following the announcement, HSBC’s shares slipped about one percent in early London trading.The move comes after HSBC lost part of an appeal in a Luxembourg court ruling last Friday. The case relates to Herald Fund, which filed a lawsuit in Luxembourg in 2009, the same year Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison for running one of the world’s largest financial frauds.In its statement, HSBC noted that “the eventual financial impact could be significantly different” from the $1.1 billion it is currently setting aside, as quoted by AFP.Madoff, a New York-based financier, ran a Ponzi scheme that deceived tens of thousands of investors worldwide. The scam used new investors’ money to pay earlier clients, creating the illusion of steady returns.Madoff died in prison in 2021 from chronic kidney failure.The fraud unraveled during the 2008 financial crisis, when Madoff could no longer meet investors’ withdrawal requests.

Tesla workers vs Musk: Why Swedish mechanics have been on strike for two years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-workers-vs-musk-why-swedish-mechanics-have-been-on-strike-for-two-years/articleshow/124850458.cms,"Image: Getty images

A fight for collective bargaining rights



Tesla stands firm

A dispute bigger than the picket line

No end in sight





A small group of Tesla mechanics in Sweden has spent two years on the picket lines in a rare and escalating confrontation with one of the world’s most powerful carmakers. Around 70 workers at Tesla’s service centres walked out in October 2023, demanding that the company sign a collective bargaining agreement — a cornerstone of Sweden’s labour system. While operations at the electric car giant continue largely unaffected, the strike has become symbolic: a showdown between Sweden’s union-centred workplace culture and Elon Musk’s vocal opposition to organised labour. Despite mediation efforts and growing pressure, neither side appears close to backing down.Sweden’s unions play a major role in setting pay and working conditions, and roughly 90% of the workforce is protected by collective agreements. IF Metall, the union representing the mechanics, argues that Tesla should not operate outside these long-standing norms. The group says it tried for years to open talks, but the company refused. When Tesla declined again to negotiate, IF Metall called the strike — a tool that is rarely needed in Sweden because most firms voluntarily engage with unions.Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk has consistently rejected unionisation, describing it as a source of conflict within companies.In Sweden, the firm has continued to operate workshops with non-striking staff, contractors and imported workers. That approach has frustrated union members on the ground, who say they are witnessing business as usual while they stand outside in freezing temperatures. The impasse has since drawn in other Swedish unions, port workers, postal employees and electricians, who have staged sympathy actions to pressure the company.What began as a local labour dispute is now seen as a test of the Swedish model itself. Supporters of the strike warn that if Tesla succeeds in avoiding collective bargaining, other multinational companies may follow. Employers’ groups in Sweden typically support the negotiated system, which they say provides stability and predictability. The government has so far avoided intervening, but public sympathy has largely remained with the workers.As the strike stretches into its third winter, there is no clear resolution ahead. The workers insist they will not return until a collective agreement is signed. Tesla, meanwhile, appears confident it can withstand pressure while maintaining operations. For the striking mechanics, the fight has become about more than pay — it is about defending a core national principle they say is worth standing in the cold for.","Around 70 workers at Tesla’s service centres walked out in October 2023.

Billionaire Ray Dalio thinks American economy is dependent on the 1%; with only three states driving its GDP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/billionaire-ray-dalio-thinks-american-economy-is-dependent-on-the-1-with-only-three-states-driving-its-gdp/articleshow/124849170.cms,"Driving the News



The Divide in Numbers



A Growing Wealth Gap



Data from the Federal Reserve show how sharply the wealth divide has grown:

Between 2020 and 2025, the bottom 50% of Americans gained about $2 trillion in wealth.

The top 0.1%, meanwhile, nearly doubled their assets from $12.17 trillion to $22.33 trillion.

Why It Matters



Why His Views Matter



Bottom Line







The American economy may look healthy on paper. Wall Street is roaring, Silicon Valley is buzzing with AI optimism, unemployment is steady, and GDP is rising. But billionaire investor Ray Dalio says this apparent prosperity hides a deeper imbalance. The US, he argues, is becoming dangerously dependent on a small, highly productive elite, while the majority of its workers are falling behind.Speaking at the Fortune Global Forum in Riyadh, the Bridgewater Associates founder said the US economy can no longer be viewed “as a whole.” “You have to look at everything in terms of the very, very big differences and how those differences are handled,” Dalio said. He explained that about 1% of Americans — roughly three million people — are leading in areas like AI and technology, with another 5–10% around them forming the productive core. “The rest — the bottom 60% — are struggling,” he added, pointing to low literacy and declining productivity as warning signs.Dalio’s remarks echo new research from Moody’s, which found that 22 US states are in recession, while 13 are stagnant and only 16 are growing.Yet, the national numbers appear healthy because three states — California, Texas, and New York — are driving most of America’s GDP.As Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi explained, California’s tech sector and New York’s financial power are propping up the entire system: “The future of the entire US economy is tied to the growth in two states.”Dalio also highlighted the deeper social implications: “Consider this, 60% of the American population has below sixth-grade reading level. That’s tough... and because of those things you have a dependency, an extreme dependency.”Dalio says this poses a major policy challenge:“The question is what do [policymakers] do when you don’t have enough money and you have this big wealth gap?” He cautioned that redistributing wealth is a “very difficult decision” with serious consequences for productivity. His advice to leaders was to treat it as a mechanical, not ideological, issue: “What you have is a choice of who’s gonna pay and how are you going to do this?”Even consumer spending reflects the same imbalance. Moody’s found that top earners — those in the 96.6% to 100% bracket — have lifted their spending to 170 basis points compared with 1999 levels, while low and middle-income Americans are at around 120, barely keeping up with inflation. “The US economy is being largely powered by the well-to-do,” said Zandi. “As long as they keep spending, the economy should avoid recession, but if they turn more cautious, for whatever reason, the economy has a big problem. ”Dalio is an American investor, hedge fund manager, author, and philanthropist best known as the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world’s largest and most influential investment firms. Born in New York City in 1949, Dalio grew up in a middle-class household and developed an early fascination with markets, buying his first stock, Northeast Airlines, at the age of 12.After earning a degree from Long Island University and an MBA from Harvard Business School, he started Bridgewater in 1975 from his small apartment in New York. Over time, Bridgewater became a global powerhouse managing tens of billions of dollars for governments, pension funds, and institutions. Its flagship fund, the Pure Alpha Fund, gained fame for its consistent performance and for anticipating major economic events such as the 2008 financial crisis.Dalio’s reputation rests not only on his investing skill but also on his unique management philosophy. He introduced the idea of “radical transparency” at Bridgewater, a culture where employees are encouraged to question each other openly and where meetings are recorded to promote honesty and accountability. His book Principles: Life and Work presents these ideas, blending practical lessons with reflections on decision-making, leadership, and personal growth.Beyond finance, Dalio has become a leading commentator on global economics, debt cycles, and inequality. He frequently warns about the risks of widening wealth gaps and declining productivity, arguing that such divides can threaten social and political stability.In recent years, Dalio has stepped back from day-to-day management at Bridgewater to focus on mentoring, writing, and philanthropy. Through the Dalio Foundation, he supports education, ocean exploration, and mental health research. Today, he remains one of the most influential voices in economic thought and a figure whose career reflects discipline, curiosity, and an enduring search for truth.Ray Dalio’s message is clear: America’s economy has split into two worlds. One is led by a small group whose productivity and innovation sustain national growth. The other, much larger group, struggles with low literacy, weak income, and declining productivity. The risk, he warns, is not just inequality but dependence — a nation living off the output of its top 1%.","Billionaire investor Ray Dalio says the US economy can no longer be viewed “as a whole” He argues that about 1% of Americans are leading in areas like AI and technology. “The rest — the bottom 60% — are struggling,” he added, pointing to low literacy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124849470,imgsize-1027019,width-400,resizemode-4/ray-dalio-says-only-three-states-are-running-america39s-gdp.jpg"

'Don't Need U.S. Or Europe': Lula For Smashing Western Dominance, Echoes Putin After Trump Meet





Brazilian President Lula da Silva on Monday said US President Donald Trump had “assured” him that a trade deal between the two nations was close, signalling a possible reset in strained ties.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Asean summit in Malaysia, Lula said their meeting was “surprisingly good” and that both sides were working to resolve ongoing tariff and sanctions disputes, including US measures targeting several Brazilian officials and a top Supreme Court judge.“The meeting I had with President Trump was surprisingly good. I’m convinced that in a few days we’ll have a definitive solution between the United States and Brazil, so that life can continue well and happily.

China’s foreign minister Wang Yi on Monday said that a “multipolar world is coming,” ahead of a key meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week.His remarks appeared to be a veiled jibe at the United States and its approach to global trade and alliances.Speaking at a forum in Beijing, Wang called for an end to the “politicisation of economic and trade issues” and warned against “fragmenting global markets” through protectionist measures, as reported by AFP.He said repeated withdrawals from international agreements and the creation of rival blocs were putting multilateral cooperation under strain.“The tide of history cannot be reversed, and a multipolar world is coming,” Wang said. He further stressed that countries should work together to maintain global stability and openness.His remarks come as global markets closely watch the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea on Thursday, which many hope will ease tensions between the world’s two largest economies.The meeting will mark the first face-to-face talks between the leaders since Trump began his second term in January.The trade conflict between Washington and Beijing has intensified since Trump announced sweeping tariffs earlier this year.The two sides have recently been negotiating to avoid another round of 100% tariffs due to take effect on November 1.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng held two days of discussions over the weekend.Both sides reported progress, with China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang saying a “preliminary consensus” had been reached.Bessent told ABC News that the additional tariffs had been “effectively averted.” He added that both sides were close to finalising agreements on rare earth exports and American soybean trade.","China's foreign minister Wang Yi on Monday said that a “multipolar world is coming,” ahead of a key meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week.

Stock markets in Asia jumped on Monday after the United States and China outlined a framework for a potential trade deal, raising hopes that tensions between the world’s two largest economies may ease.The development boosted investor confidence across regional markets, which opened higher following a strong finish on Wall Street last week.In early trade, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 2.1% to 50,321.49, crossing the 50,000 level for the first time and continuing a run of record highs on expectations of major fiscal spending under the nation’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.

Building a business



Still working hard…







Moving halfway across the world at 19 might make one feel alone, uncertain, and homesick. But that’s how Money Singh’s story in America began, which took him from being a depressed teenager to owning multiple businesses in the United States of America.Recalling his early days in San Francisco after leaving Punjab in 2006, Singh said, “I was [depressed] for that one year. I wanted to go back.”What started as a reluctant move eventually turned out to be the beginning of his American dream, that made him go from a cab dispatcher earning $6 an hour to running two successful businesses worth over a million dollars each, CNBC reported.His first years in the Bay Area were far from easy. Singh enrolled in college but dropped out when he realised his credits from India wouldn’t transfer. When Singh’s mother urged him to work, he took a short stint at a local drugstore before joining his uncle’s cab company.The next 12 years were spent in the taxi business. Singh drove his own cab, built a small five-car fleet, started his own dispatch company, and later launched Driver’s Network, a marketing agency for independent drivers.By 2018, he was ready for a new challenge. And hence, alongside his existing venture, now known as ATCS Platform Solutions, Singh decided to try something entirely different route, a barbershop.With help from his partner Joypreet and inspiration from his mother, a salon owner in both India and Northern California, Singh opened Dandies Barbershop & Beard Stylist in Mountain View in June 2019.It was a gamble, but it paid off. According to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It, Dandies generated $1.07 million in sales last year, while ATCS brought in $1.18 million in revenue. Both businesses are profitable, and Singh splits his time between them, full-time at Dandies and around 20 hours a week on ATCS.Before the success came struggle. Singh invested $75,000 from his taxi savings and spent a year battling permits and paperwork. “You have to go through permitting. You have to go through dealing with the city,” he told CNBC.“It took me a solid year to get the license to even open the shop, so I was paying rent for one year before I could open the shop.”He had no experience as a barber, so he partnered with a friend. Then, six months later, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. His partner left due to a family emergency, forcing Singh to shut down the shop for almost a year, though the rent bills never stopped.To keep Dandies alive, Singh pulled every financial lever available. He received two Paycheck Protection Program loans, one for $68,000 and another for $18,000, the latter eventually forgiven. He borrowed $20,000 from friends, withdrew $30,000 from his life insurance, built up $80,000 in credit card debt, and even sold his stock portfolio.“I had to sell everything,” he told CNBC. “I had to eat less. I literally had to focus on eating $1 per meal to make sure the business stays open.”During the shutdown, Singh joined barber school so that he could expand services when Dandies reopened in 2021. The move worked. “As we got more engaged with the community, I had a lot of people from every aspect of life: Men, women, LGBTQ, kids. Almost everybody wanted to come to Dandies,” he says. “So we started expanding into different skill sets and we wanted to cater to everybody.”Today, Dandies has three locations, 25 employees, including 15 barbers and consistent profits. Singh takes home around $7,000 per month, divided between $3,000 from Dandies and $4,000 from ATCS. He’s paid off his credit cards and insurance loans, and now repays about $300 a month on his remaining PPP loan.Growing up in Punjab during the violent clashes between Sikh separatists and the government, his family faced repeated tragedies. His father survived being shot by a terrorist back in 1988. Three years later, a bomb exploded outside the family’s convenience store, and later, floods destroyed what remained.“I just don’t feel any different. I’m doing the same thing that I was doing 19 years ago,” Singh says. “I still work 15 to 16 hours a day. I still work hard. I still do the things that I need to do ... Those are the habits that I’ve developed since my childhood.”Now, Singh is preparing for his next leap, a new app called Barber’s Network, which will let barbers and clients book chairs and appointments across the US, similar to platforms like Booksy or theCut. He’s funding the development with profits from Dandies, CNBC reported.Slowing down? That’s not on his list. “I don’t think I’ll ever retire. I would want to work all the way through,” he says. “That’s just what I breathe.”","Money Singh moved to the U.S. from Punjab, India, at the age of 19. He went from working as a cab dispatcher to running two successful businesses worth over a million dollars each.

Canada’s Reagan Ad ‘Trump Card’ Ends U.S. Trade Talks | What Is Trump So Angry About

Driving the news

Carney’s response

What’s behind Trump’s anger?



Tariffs so far

50% on steel and aluminium

25% on automobiles

Over 45% on softwood lumber (after an additional 10% hike)

35% on trade outside the USMCA

25% tariff on trucks starting November 1, alongside new levies on pharmaceuticals and furniture

Domestic reaction in Canada

The road ahead

Bottom line





Prime Minister Mark Carney is trying to project calm and control after US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Canadian imports by another 10%. The escalation, triggered by a provincial TV ad during the World Series, has reignited the trade tensions that Carney had hoped to cool.The US and Canada are once again on the brink of a full-scale trade war. Trump’s latest tariffs come after Ottawa and Washington had already been negotiating a truce over previous trade restrictions. This time, the spark wasn’t steel or lumber, but a one-minute television spot from Ontario invoking Ronald Reagan to criticise American protectionism.For Carney, the political optics are tricky. He must reassure Canadian businesses and consumers while showing the US that Canada will not be bullied by sudden outbursts from the White House.Trump announced a 10% hike on Canadian imports after an Ontario government-funded ad aired during Game 1 of the World Series. The ad used 1980s footage of Ronald Reagan criticising tariffs, something Trump claims was taken “out of context.” He demanded the ad be pulled “immediately” and accused Canada of running “fraudulent” propaganda.Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would remove the ad after the weekend, but the damage was done.Trump abruptly broke off trade talks and announced the tariff increase.Speaking from Kuala Lumpur, where he’s attending the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit, Carney said his government is “ready to resume trade negotiations” and will unveil an “ambitious budget” in two weeks featuring “generational investments” in the domestic economy.He emphasised diversification, shifting Canada’s trade focus toward Asia to reduce reliance on the United States, which he described as an “unpredictable and unreliable partner.” Carney also confirmed plans to finalise a free-trade deal with ASEAN nations by next year, along with a parallel pact with the Philippines.In an apparent dig at Trump, Carney said:“It underscores the importance of reliable partners who honour their commitments.”Trump’s reaction appears less about economic policy and more about optics. The 60-second Ontario ad was produced and paid for by the province, not Ottawa, but Trump viewed it as an affront to his trade policies.In Reagan’s original 1980s radio address, he actually defended certain tariffs on Japan but warned that widespread protectionism hurts Americans. The Ontario ad highlighted only the latter point, leading Trump to claim it misrepresented Reagan’s message.The US under Trump has already imposed a range of levies on Canadian exports:Canadian industries are reeling, with the automotive, lumber, and manufacturing sectors hit hardest.Flavio Volpe, head of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, called the new tariffs “unprovoked and unwarranted,” warning that they will raise costs for US consumers more than Canadians.Jason Kenney, former Alberta premier, defended the Ontario ad as a faithful replay of Reagan’s remarks.Goldy Hyder, CEO of the Business Council of Canada, criticised provincial freelancing on foreign policy:“You don’t see governor after governor on television... Canada can’t have premiers freelancing on the US relationship.”Carney used similar language, stressing that only the federal government conducts international trade talks.This is the second time Trump has walked away from talks with Canada this year. In June, he halted negotiations after Ottawa passed a digital sales tax on US tech firms, resuming only after Carney repealed the measure.Carney’s challenge now is balancing economic reassurance at home with diplomatic composure abroad. He must convince Canadians that their government can weather Trump’s volatility while proving to Washington that Canada will not be drawn into political theatrics over a one-minute ad.Carney’s message is clear. Canada will not be hostage to Trump’s temper. His plan is to build resilience at home, expand markets abroad, and wait for the storm to pass.

FULL: Trump’s 'Bad Years' Note For China On Tariffs, Taiwan; Big Message To Putin, Kim Jong Un





US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that Washington and Beijing have reached a “very substantial framework” that would prevent the US from imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and allow for a deferral of China’s rare earths export controls, as per news agency Reuters.The development follows high-level talks in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week.Bessent told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the framework will enable discussions on more balanced US-China trade, Chinese purchases of American soybeans and other agricultural products, and measures to address the US fentanyl crisis.“No, I’m not [anticipating the 100% tariffs], and I’m also anticipating that we will get some kind of a deferral on the rare earth export controls that the Chinese had discussed,” he said.Final terms are expected to be decided by Trump and Xi, he added.The talks come as tensions have escalated in recent weeks. Trump had threatened new triple-digit tariffs starting on November 1 in response to China’s expanded controls on rare earth magnets and minerals.The US and China previously rolled back most of their tariffs under a trade truce signed in May, which is due to expire on November 10. Bessent said the truce could be extended pending the president’s decision.Economic officials from both countries, including China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang, held discussions with Bessent and US trade representative Jamieson Greer on the sidelines of the Asean summit Li said a preliminary consensus was reached on a range of issues, including the extension of the trade truce, fentanyl and export controls, though he did not provide specific details.Trump, who arrived in Malaysia on Sunday for the Asean summit, expressed confidence about a deal.“I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday,” Bessent told reporters, while Trump said, “I think we’re going to have a deal with China”, according to Reuters.The US president also indicated the possibility of additional meetings with Xi in China and the United States.The framework aims to de-escalate the fragile trade war, which has involved repeated sanctions, export curbs, and threats of retaliatory measures.Among the key issues on the agenda for Trump-Xi talks are Chinese purchases of US soybeans, Taiwan, and the release of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai.The rare earth export controls have caused global supply concerns, prompting Washington to consider restrictions on software-powered exports to China, including laptops and jet engines.The outcome of the Kuala Lumpur talks is expected to clear the way for Trump and Xi to meet next week in South Korea, though Beijing has yet to officially confirm the face-to-face summit.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said Washington and Beijing have reached a “very substantial framework” that would prevent the US from imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods.

US President Donald Trump signed a trade agreement with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and took part in the signing of a historic peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand, called the “Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords”.Trump arrived in the country to attend the ongoing ASEAN Summit ""Today, the Prime Minister and I signed a major trade deal between the United States and Malaysia.""Speaking at the ceremony, described his visit as “a mission of friendship and goodwill” aimed at deepening commerce, strengthening security, and promoting “stability, prosperity and peace” across the region.He added, “That’s why I’m delighted that in addition to the agreement with Malaysia this week, we’re also signing or nearing completion on trade deals with many other Indo Pacific partners. From Cambodia to Japan to South Korea, we’re delighted to forge richer partnerships on energy, technology, artificial intelligence, critical minerals and other industries.”The US President further hailed America’s economic performance, saying, “The United States is having its golden age. Last year we were a country that was doing very poorly under a different semi leadership. I don’t even call it a leadership.But this year we’re doing numbers that nobody ever thought it was possible for any country to do. We’ll be at the end of my first year, over $20 trillion worth of investment into the United States. There’s no country anywhere that’s ever done anything close to that. The United States last year, for the four years it was announced, did less than $1 trillion. And we’re going to be doing over 20. That’s quite a difference.”He emphasised America’s commitment to Southeast Asia, stating, “The United States is for you. It’s committed to a free and open and thriving Indo Pacific. My message to the nations of Southeast Asia is that the United States is with you 100%. And we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come.”Trump’s visit marks his first ASEAN summit since 2017 and his first trip to Asia in his second term. Large crowds gathered at the airport to welcome him, as he was received by Prime Minister Anwar and other Malaysian officials. Analysts say the visit aims to reaffirm US engagement in the Indo-Pacific and showcase Trump’s role as a global negotiator amid ongoing trade tensions.The US President explained the Malaysia stop was also a gesture of thanks to Anwar for his country’s role in resolving the conflict between Thailand and Cambodia.Ahead of his broader tour, Trump allso expressed optimism about a potential meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, describing a “really good chance” of reaching a comprehensive deal focused on technology and trade, particularly rare earth exports. The final leg of his Asian trip will see him meet Xi in South Korea to work on ending the ongoing US-China trade war.Trump also hinted at the possibility of engaging with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying he is “open to it,” and expects to meet Brazilian President Lula da Silva to improve relations following months of tension.","US President Donald Trump signed a trade agreement with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

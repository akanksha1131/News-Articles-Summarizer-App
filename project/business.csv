Vodafone Idea shares surge 18% after Union Cabinet approves bank guarantee waiver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vodafone-idea-shares-surge-18-after-union-cabinet-approves-bank-guarantee-waiver/articleshow/115691990.cms,"The Cabinet offered relief to telecommunications firms by eliminating bank guarantee requirements for spectrum acquisitions through 2022.

Vodafone Idea share price today: Vodafone Idea (Vi) shares surged 18.08% to Rs 8.23 on the BSE during early Tuesday trading, following the Union Cabinet's in-principle approval regarding the company's bank guarantee matter. At 2:53 PM, shares of Vi were trading at Rs 7.59, up 8.74%.The Cabinet offered relief to telecommunications firms by eliminating bank guarantee requirements for spectrum acquisitions through 2022. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had supported this waiver for spectrum purchases.The reforms of 2021 had already removed bank guarantee requirements for auctions from 2022 onwards. Vi's total bank guarantee obligation stands at Rs 24,700 crore, with the spectrum auction dues moratorium concluding in October 2025.Vodafone Idea defaulted on its second bank guarantee (BG) payment of approximately Rs 350 crore on November 1, relating to spectrum acquired in the 2012 auction. Previously, the company had missed a BG payment exceeding Rs 4,600 crore for 2016 spectrum auction in September, as reported by ET.Although Vi spearheaded the BG waiver request, with support from other telecommunications firms, the government's decision particularly advantages Vi. Whilst competitors Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio also require BG submissions for previous auction payments, their obligations are considerably smaller than Vi's.Bharti Airtel faces a BG payment of roughly Rs 2,200 crore due in September next year for the 2016 auction. Jio's obligation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore follows afterwards.Vi requested the waiver citing financial constraints, anticipating that this would enable banks to extend additional credit facilities to the company.Following this development, Bharti Airtel shares increased by 1.6% to Rs 1,604.95, whilst Jio Financial Services shares declined nearly 1% to Rs 320.10 on the BSE.","Vodafone Idea (Vi) shares surged 18.08% to Rs 8.23 on the BSE during early Tuesday trading.

Work-life balance has become a frequently discussed subject lately, with Wipro executive chairman Rishad Premji acknowledging its significance as ""incredibly important"" whilst recognising it as a ""controversial subject"". He maintains that corporate hybrid working arrangements benefit employees.Rishad Premji’s comments come days after Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy reaffirmed his position supporting a 70-hour work-week and expressed concern about India's transition from six-day to five-day workweeks in 1986, whilst rejecting the notion of work-life balance.Post-Covid, whilst Indian IT services companies adopted hybrid working arrangements, organisations like TCS, Infosys and Wipro have increasingly requested office attendance. However, many firms maintain flexibility.Speaking at the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2024, the Wipro group promoter said, ""Work-life balance is incredibly important. I learned this very early on in my early days before Covid, which is work life is something that you have to define for yourself, organizations are never going to work at it for you. So you have to define what it means and draw boundaries.""Also Read | When Narayana Murthy touched Ratan Tata’s feet Premji noted that the understanding of work-life has evolved significantly. Previously, it centered on office arrival and departure times, whereas now it might involve considerations such as managing ""Instagram access at work.""""The concept of what it means is simply not ours, it is also the freedom of what I can do with my time while at work, but not working,"" Premji elaborated.Premji said, ""The one model that IT industry has adopted, and I think the government has been supportive of is a more hybrid model of work. It is a controversial subject. But we, as a company, have said, we won't be able to come three days a week, but we want you to have the flexibility of having two days on your work place. That certainly helps with the workforce.""Addressing employee mental health and work-life balance, Premji noted the positive development of companies openly discussing these previously taboo subjects, particularly following the 2020 pandemic.He highlighted Wipro's initiative to train managers in recognising signs and conducting open discussions sensitively with staff.

How much time did you take to bring these two cars to life?

Aren't your cars getting too fancy in styling and tech for a market like India where consumers are generally conventional?

Global electric giants like China's BYD is already having a limited presence in India (through imports), while govt is trying hard to get Elon Musk's Tesla here. Does that worry you as they are strong and experienced?

Do you think that Indian companies today are good enough to match any global competition?

Many people doubt success of electrics in India. What's your forecast?

As a resurgent Mahindra & Mahindra pumps in Rs 12,000 crore into electric mobility to launch new 'lifestyle' cars, CEO Rajesh Jejurikar says that Indian companies are today confident to take on competition from any global green carmaker, and ""welcome"" players like Tesla and BYD in the market. ""It's not a question of being scared. Let them come and launch something like this in India, but at these prices,"" Jejurikar tells TOI as the company launched two electric cars, BE 6e and XUV 9e, with starting price of around Rs 20 lakh. Excerpts:From sketch to concepts, which we had showcased at Banbury in the UK, to now, we've done all this in flat three years. We are now ready to start the production of the cars soon. So, it's the fastest development and scale up for us, packed with really high technologies, which makes our cars comparable to any global luxury brand. It's comparable on every possible parameter, except the pricing where we are really aggressive .What we've experienced is that if you bring in right technologies and styling, people want them. We were surprised by popularity of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) when it was launched in XUV7OO. Knowledge and interest in autos are increasing and there is a huge awareness about what is coming in. People are today waiting to watch what is new and then aspiring to own them. I don't think our cars are ahead of time. They become ahead of time only if they are priced too high, which our cars are not.We are capable of doing anything, which is world beating. Today it gives us a lot of pride to see that primarily Indian engineers have created these two global cars in just three years. So, when it comes to global brands, it is not at all a question of being scared. We actually welcome them here. Let them come and launch something like this in India, but at these prices... Even after they localise, let's see if any of these players can do what we are doing.Yes. Because I think what we are creating today is led by the local talent that we have here. More than talent, it's the passion and the ability to work hard. I don't think this can be matched by anyone anywhere in the West. Our teams here are so passionate about what they do. Their energy and passion is the competitive edge for India.I think they should be about 30% of the market by 2030. As a country, once we start seeing success with good quality products, we will move at a very rapid rate in adoption of EVs. We haven't seen those kind of products in India yet.","Rajesh Jejurikar says Indian companies are today confident to take on competition from any global green carmaker.

'Took $55bn mcap hit since indictment'

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Adani Green Energy said Wednesday that Gautam Adani , Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain have not been charged with any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) on the counts mentioned in the criminal indictment of the US Department of Justice (DoJ) or the civil complaint of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).""These directors have been charged on three counts in the criminal indictment namely alleged securities fraud conspiracy, alleged wire fraud conspiracy, and alleged securities fraud,"" the company said in a stock exchange filing, refuting media reports that had quoted DoJ documents to say the directors were charged with breaching FCPA.Former Attorney General and senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi addressed a news conference early Wednesday to also say neither Gautam nor Sagar Adani was charged in two crucial counts.Clarifying that these were his personal legal views and that he was not a spokesman for the Adani group (but had appeared for it several cases), former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi on Wednesday said, ""My assessment is and it is clear that there are 5 charges or 5 counts. It is very important to note that count 1 and count 5 are more important than the others but neither in count 1 nor in count 5 is Mr Adani or his nephew is charged.""""So count 1 contained in paras 124 onwards of the indictment is against certain other persons minus the two Adanis. It includes some of their officers and one foreign person, that is the conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is called FCPA. It is somewhat similar to the Prevention of Corruption Act in India,"" said Rohatgi.The penalties for the other three charges are less severe than those for corruption charges. The Adani group had previously denied all allegations and said it would seek legal remedies. In a separate note, Adani group said since the indictment, it has suffered a loss of nearly $55 billion in its market capitalisation across its 11 listed companies.Last week, US prosecutors had indicted billionaire Gautam Adani and his nephew and former executives of Canadian pension fund CDPQ and Azure Power for their alleged role in a $265 million (Rs 2,000 crore) bribery case to secure solar power supply contracts in India, putting the edible oil to ports giant in the midst of a second major controversy in 22 months. The DoJ and SEC have issued a criminal indictment and brought a civil complaint against the three directors of the company. Adani Green also said on Wednesday that the US criminal indictment has not quantified any fine or penalty. However, its three directors face monetary penalties under the civil complaint but the amount has not been specified.On Nov 20, the DoJ indicted Gautam Adani and other defendants with ""conspiracies to commit securities and wire fraud and substantive securities fraud for their roles in a multi-billion-dollar scheme to obtain funds from American investors and global financial institutions on the basis of false and misleading statements"".

MUMBAI: LTIMindtree has set a bold target of more than doubling its revenue to $10 billion by FY32 from the current $4.3 billion.IT firms are navigating GenAI's seismic shift, with early adopters doing things differently compared to peers, where winners do not necessarily take it all. With GenAI being a paradigm-shifter, businesses are embracing it rather than running the risk of being replaced, even if it means cannibalising portions of their existing revenue streams.LTIMindtree's strategy is underpinned by building upon its strong foundation of accelerating momentum in key verticals like BFSI and technology, expanding its client base of Fortune 500 customers , leveraging horizontal capabilities in data and analytics, and growing its hyperscaler partnerships. LTIMindtree counts Microsoft, Citi, Nordea, SITA, and Barclays as some of its top clients.""We want to become a $10 billion company, maintaining our consistent and profitable growth. We are seeing a lot of technology disruptions; the dollars are not easy.If you look at the journey that other companies went through from $5 billion to $10 billion, it was always based on very large deals. But I do not think we are going to rely on just two or three large deals. Two of our industry verticals, BFSI and technology, are more than $1 billion at this point in time. We are very confident that the BFSI portfolio can easily catapult to $2 billion when we look at the overall $10 billion pie,"" company CEO and MD Debashis Chatterjee said.Chatterjee said its strategic pivot at the intersection of three themes - AI in everything, everything for AI, and AI for everyone - is embedded with renewed vigour. ""Whatever we do for our clients, we embed AI. There is a vendor consolidation deal we closed some time ago. The five-year deal is a combination of renewal and a new scope. However, there is a significant infusion of AI, which means that I cannibalised my own revenues and cannibalised some of the revenues that belong to competitors,"" he added.The commercial construct in new deals is a departure from traditional outsourcing models, which end up in a pricing war. In conventional outsourcing arrangements, companies engage in competitive pricing, resulting in minimal first-year margins during portfolio transition, with margin recovery occurring in years three to five.However, COO Nachiket Deshpande said that in the firm's AI-driven approach , the deal construct is significantly different.",LTIMindtree has set a bold target of more than doubling its revenue to $10 billion by FY32 from the current $4.3 billion.

The GDP of the world's largest economy has exceeded 2% in eight out of the past nine quarters.The GDP data also revealed that a measure of the economy's fundamental strength which includes consumer spending and private investment and excludes variable components such as exports, inventories and government expenditure, increased at a robust 3.2% annual rate from July through September, improving from 2.7% in the April-June period.Consumer expenditure, representing approximately 70% of US economic activity, grew to a 3.5% annual rate in the last quarter, rising from 2.8% in April-June and marking the fastest increase since the fourth quarter of 2023. Exports also enhanced third-quarter growth, rising at a 7.5% rate, the highest in two years.However, both consumer spending and export growth were below the Commerce Department's initial projections.Business investment growth decelerated notably due to reduced investment in residential properties and commercial structures like offices and warehouses, although equipment expenditure increased significantly.The incoming President-elect will assume leadership of a generally stable economy when he takes office next month.The economic indicators show stability.

It said signs of an economic recovery were emerging.In a note of caution, it said ""the critical next steps are to complete the commercial debt restructuring, finalize bilateral agreements with official creditors along the lines of the accord with the Official Creditor Committee and implement the terms of the other agreements. This will help restore Sri Lanka's debt sustainability.""Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022 with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to 70 per cent, its currency to record lows and its economy contracting by 7.3 per cent during the worst of the fallout and by 2.3 per cent last year.""Maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring debt sustainability are key to securing Sri Lanka's prosperity and require persevering with responsible fiscal policy,"" the IMF said.The IMF bailout secured in March last year helped stabilise economic conditions.

A claim that Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott , novelist, philanthropist, and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , of ""destroying Western civilization "" is currently resurfacing on social media. These rumors spread on various platforms, including Reddit, where one post claimed that Musk had criticized Scott for her philanthropy, which focuses on women, minorities, and marginalized groups.The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.In March 2024, Musk posted a now-deleted tweet that read, ""Super rich ex-wives who hate their former spouse should be listed among 'Reasons that Western Civilization died.'"" Musk was responding to a post that criticized Scott’s philanthropic efforts, specifically noting that over half of her donations went to organizations focused on race and gender issues. The post asked, ""Who is Bezos' ex giving money to?""While Musk didn't directly name Scott, the context of his reply clearly pointed to the ex-wife of Bezos. The deleted tweet sparked significant backlash, and Musk later removed it. However, the tweet was preserved in the internet archive.This wasn't the first time Musk publicly criticized Scott’s charitable work. In May 2022, Musk expressed concerns about her donations, particularly to Democratic causes, according to a Snopes report. He suggested that Scott, in retaliation for her divorce from Bezos, was targeting all tech moguls, including him, by supporting political movements he believed opposed his business ventures, like Tesla.Scott is a prominent philanthropist. At the time of her 2019 divorce from Jeff Bezos, after 25 years of marriage, Scott, 50, received a 4% stake in Amazon. Forbes currently estimates her net worth at $30 billion, a decrease from $38 billion just days earlier and significantly lower than her peak of $59 billion in 2021.","Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott of ""destroying Western civilization"" The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.

This indicates a declining workforce demand, despite overall economic strength.The monthly average of weekly claims decreased by 3,750 to 217,750, smoothing out weekly fluctuations.Jobless benefit applications serve as an indicator of US redundancies.Following weakening employment figures and declining consumer prices, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points in September, followed by a 0.25-point reduction this month.Fed officials anticipated four benchmark rate reductions next year, following three cuts this year, as projected in September. However, this outlook has rapidly evolved.Recent robust economic indicators and President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies have prompted a more conservative approach from the Fed, potentially resulting in fewer reductions and higher rates than previously anticipated.The central bank has shifted its priority from inflation control to employment support, aiming to achieve a delicate balance of reducing inflation without triggering economic decline.September's 0.5-point rate reduction marked the Fed's first cut in four years, following increases since 2022 that elevated the federal funds rate to 5.3%, a 20-year high.Despite October's slight increase, inflation has consistently declined over two years, approaching the Fed's 2% goal, leading Chair Powell to confirm its general containment.In late October, government reports showed a Fed-monitored inflation measure reached its lowest point in three-and-a-half years.Early 2024 saw jobless benefit applications averaging 213,000 weekly before rising in May. July figures reached 250,000, suggesting high interest rates were affecting US employment.The US economy generated only 12,000 jobs in October, though economists noted the impact of strikes and hurricanes on temporary unemployment.The Labour Department's August report revealed 818,000 fewer jobs were created from April 2023 through March than initially reported, indicating a gradual employment slowdown and influencing the Fed's rate reduction decisions.","US unemployment benefit applications dropped by 6,000 to a near seven-month low to 213,000 last week.

This announcement demonstrates that limiting global warming to 1.5°C with limited overshoot is still possible with strong mitigation efforts.The countries have committed to a linear or steeper trajectory of emissions reductions as a floor for ambition in their next NDCs. This is a critical step towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals.This is the first time countries have explicitly defined how their individual emissions reduction goals will align with the collective global stocktake call at COP28. Recent analysis shows that if all countries reduce emissions on a straight line to net zero GHG—and those who have not yet set all-GHG net zero targets do so—global temperature rise would be limited to an average of 1.4C by the end of the century. This is a dramatic improvement from the average 2.7C temperature rise that the world is currently on track for.The United Kingdom, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates have announced 2035 NDC targets that set a high bar for ambition. Bhutan, Madagascar, Panama, and Suriname have already achieved net zero greenhouse gas emissions.Canada, Chile, the European Union, Georgia, Mexico, Norway, and Switzerland aim to submit next NDCs that are consistent with the IPCC emissions trajectories and the global stocktake call for deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5°C. Absolute, economy-wide reduction targets covering all greenhouse gases, sectors, and categories; and aligned with steep and credible emissions reductions toward their respective mid-century net zero goals, consistent with a linear or steeper trajectory.""Together, we recognize the urgency of action to address the climate crisis and the critical role of major emitters in putting the world on a 1.5°C pathway.

We stand as living proof that net-zero emissions are attainable, even for nations with limited resources. We call on the rest of the world to rise to the occasion, match our ambition, and embrace transformational changes to keep 1.5°C within reach. Climate leadership knows no borders, and the time for bold action is now,” joint statement from Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan; President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar, President Jose Raul Mulino of Panama, President Chan Santokhi of Suriname.“The Paris Agreement is working and keeping 1.5C within reach is both an environmental imperative and an economic opportunity. That’s why I join global partners to call for climate ambition as we commit to putting forward ambitious 2035 climate plans. Canada understands its responsibility and looks forward to securing an ambitious and hopeful outcome that delivers for the people and the planet at COP29”, said Steven Guilbeault, Canada's minister of environment and climate change.“Mexico is committed for renewed commitment to ambitious climate action as a foundational condition for social justice and shared prosperity.

Prior to this latest amalgamation of two of those groups, Group CEO Wu had also been CEO of the Taobao and Tmall Group and Alibaba's cloud division.Alibaba's e-commerce platforms have been under pressure both at home and abroad as aggressive new players such as PDD Holdings' Chinese platform Pinduoduo and international site Temu, along with ByteDance's domestic Chinese Douyin and international TikTok, gain market share selling low-cost goods.In April, co-founder Jack Ma expressed support for the internet giant's restructuring efforts, and acknowledged past mistakes in a lengthy memo to employees.The turnaround efforts have seen some success, with the international division growing rapidly under Jiang's leadership. In September quarter earnings last week, AIDC reported stand-out growth of 29%.China's challenging consumer environment has put pressure on all retailers and e-commerce platforms, though Alibaba appears to have halted some erosion of its lead in market share in recent quarters.After the government unveiled economic stimulus measures in September, this year's Singles Day sales festival, China's biggest shopping event, outperformed muted analyst expectations.Alibaba did not disclose sales figures for the almost month-long event, but said there was ""robust growth"" in sales and a record number of shoppers.",Alibaba Group will merge its domestic and international e-commerce platforms.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

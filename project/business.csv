When should you exit an investment? Top things to keep in mind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-should-you-exit-an-investment-top-things-to-keep-in-mind/articleshow/119410980.cms,"Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable.

By Sandeep Walunj

""If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is – almost never."" – Philip Fisher

""You may not know when to start but must know when to stop!""

Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable:

1. Achievement of Goals

Did you invest with a clear goal—retirement, buying a house, or funding education? If so, exit when the goal nears.

Shift to less volatile asset classes as the exit date approaches to minimize risks.

2. Profit Booking

Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio – If significantly above historical or sector averages, it may indicate overvaluation. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio – A high ratio may signal overvaluation relative to intrinsic worth. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis – If the stock price has reached its fair value based on future cash flows, exiting may be prudent.

Reinvest proceeds wisely and consider tax implications.

During a market rally, sell in tranches to secure gains while retaining exposure.

3.

Stop-Loss Strategy

A stop-loss order sets a predetermined exit point to limit losses.

Example: If a stock is bought at ₹100 with a 10% stop-loss, sell it at ₹90, preventing larger losses.

Set stop-loss levels based on investment type—example 5-15% for volatile stocks, 15-25% for stable blue-chip stocks—aligned with your risk tolerance.

4. Underperformance

Mutual Funds – If it lags behind category peers and benchmarks persistently.

Stocks – Red flags include:

Declining revenues and profits. Rising debt levels. Loss of market leadership. Governance issues (e.g., fraud, regulatory troubles).



5. Portfolio Rebalancing

A well-diversified portfolio needs periodic rebalancing.

If an asset class grows disproportionately large, reduce exposure and reinvest in underweighted assets.

Example: If equities surge, selling some stocks and reallocating to bonds can maintain balance.

6. Market and Economic Conditions

Rising Interest Rates – Sectors like real estate and capital-intensive industries may underperform in this scenario.

Recession Indicators – An inverted yield curve or declining consumer spending may warrant exiting cyclical stocks.

Regulatory Changes – New laws, tax policies, or sectoral regulations can impact profitability.

Behavioural Biases That Delay Exit Decisions

Loss Aversion – Refusing to sell at a loss, hoping for recovery instead of reallocating capital.

Confirmation Bias – Ignoring negative signals and focusing only on positive news.

Anchoring Bias – Fixating on past high prices and resisting selling below that level.

"Gratuity eligibility, payout and formula: Leaving job before 5 years? Here’s how you can still get gratuity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/savings/gratuity-eligibility-payout-and-formula-leaving-job-before-5-years-heres-how-you-can-still-get-gratuity/articleshow/119248440.cms,"Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. (AI image)

How is gratuity payment calculated? Formula explained

The calculation method is: (15X Final drawn salary X Service duration)/26

The computation would be: (15X40,000X5)/26.

The gratuity amount due to Mis X is Rs 1,15,384.61, rounded to Rs 1,15,385.

For staff not under the Payment of Gratuity Act's purview:

The computation for his gratuity proceeds as: (15X40,000X6)/30.

The final gratuity amount that Mr X shall receive is Rs 1,20,000.

Salaried employees quite often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company). The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation. But, did you know that you can qualify for gratuity payout before completing five years, provided they serve beyond a particular duration.According to an ET report, experts say that employees qualify for gratuity upon completing 4 years and 240 days with an organisation. For example, if someone began working at an organisation on January 1, 2021, they would be eligible for gratuity upon leaving after August 29, 2025. This eligibility occurs because they would have served 4 years and 240 days by then, although their five-year milestone would only be completed by January 1, 2026.This provision exists because of how continuous service is defined in the Payment of Gratuity Act Puneet Gupta, Tax Partner, EY India, told ET, ""Section 4(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act says that gratuity will be payable if an employee has rendered a minimum continuous service of five years. Section 2A of the Payment of Gratuity Act defines continuous service. Section 2A(2) of the Gratuity Act defines the deemed-to-be in continuous service. An employee is deemed to be in continuous service for one year if an employee during the 12 preceding calendar months has worked under the employer for not less than 190 days or 240 days, as the case may be.""Also Read | Tax planning before March 31 deadline? Tax saving fixed deposits with high interest rates - check list According to the Payment of Gratuity Act, employees working in underground mines or establishments operating fewer than six days weekly must complete 190 days, whilst others need 240 days. When an employee completes more than 240 days in the fifth year, they are considered to have completed an additional year of service, totalling five years, thus becoming eligible for gratuity.Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner at Deloitte India explains that an employee on payroll becomes eligible for gratuity payment upon completing 4 years and 240 days of service when leaving the organisation. The 240-day period is equivalent to 7.89 months. Therefore, workers should ensure their tenure extends to 4 years and 8 months to qualify for gratuity benefits upon resignation or retirement, she says. Consequently, staff members whose continuous service falls short of 4 years and 240 days, for instance, those departing after 4 years and 6 months or 4 years, 6 months and 1 day, cannot claim gratuity benefits, she notes.The requirement of five years' continuous service is waived if the employee's service ends due to death or disablement.Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. The calculation method varies depending on whether employees fall under the Act's purview or not.Also Read | Gold prices at record high! Have yellow metal prices peaked? Check these 5 charts before putting more money in gold The Act's applicability is determined by the organisation's workforce size. If an organisation has employed 10 or more people on any single day within the previous 12 calendar months, it comes under the Act's jurisdiction. Once covered, the organisation remains subject to the Act even if staff numbers subsequently decrease below 10.For staff members covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, the payment is calculated using 15 days of their final drawn salary for each full year of service, including any period exceeding six months.The final drawn salary encompasses basic pay, dearness allowance and sales commission, as stipulated in the Act.Consider Miss X who has served an organisation (with a six-day work week) for 4 years and 300 days. Her eligibility for gratuity payment is confirmed as her service exceeds 4 years and 240 days. With a final basic salary of Rs 40,000, the 300 days convert to 9.863 months. For gratuity calculations, when excess months exceed 6 (9 months here), it counts as one complete year.Also Read | New TDS rules from April 1, 2025: Check new tax deduction limits for FD interest, MFs and lottery wins Gratuity remains payable even when organisations aren't covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act. In such instances, the gratuity is calculated as half a month's salary per completed service year, disregarding any incomplete year (months less than a year) in the calculation.The gratuity calculation follows this equation: (15 X Last drawn salary X Number of years of completed service)/30.Consider a scenario where Mr X has served an organisation (not under the Act's purview) for 6 years and 7 months. His final basic salary stands at Rs 40,000, and the organisation opts to provide him with gratuity.","Salaried employees often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company) The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation.

In her reply to the discussion on the Bill, Sitharaman highlighted the changes in customs duties . “We aim to boost domestic production and enhance export competitiveness by reducing duties on raw materials and inputs, making domestic products more cost-effective,” she said.

The current law permits the examination of books of account, physically kept or every manual record, which shows income expenditure.Since the 1961 Act does not mention the digital records, most often it becomes contentious and people go to the court and seek protection from not sharing passcode, she said. “So, digital becomes an issue. What prevails now with the gap and that gap is getting filled up in the new Income Tax Bill, which is before the select committee,” she said.The new Bill gives tax officers powers to override the access code of computer systems and virtual digital space, including online trading and investment accounts as well as cloud servers, in search and seizure cases.Now, the Budget will be taken up for discussion by the Rajya Sabha.","In Budget, FM had proposed a relief of up to Rs 1.1 lakh for taxpayers.

$601 million tax & fine notice to Samsung,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/601-million-tax-fine-notice-to-samsung/articleshow/119508025.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tax authorities have ordered Samsung and its executives in the country to pay $601 million (nearly Rs 5,150 crore) in back taxes and penalties for dodging tariffs on import of key telecoms equipment, a govt order showed, for one of the biggest such demands in recent years.

BENGALURU: The mystery shrouding the death of realtor, who was found dead with stab injuries in the neck on the outskirts of the city on Saturday evening, has been unravelled: His wife and mother-in-law were allegedly driven to the act after enduring endless harassment from him.The accused, 19-year-old Yashasvini Singh and 37-year-old Hema Bai, have been arrested by Soladevanahalli police. The incident occurred at BGS Layout near Bilijaji area in north Bengaluru and the deceased is 37-year-old Loknath Singh, a resident of Kannur Gate in Magadi taluk of Ramanagara district. Preliminary investigation revealed that Loknath was sedated before murder.Loknath, who had cheating cases registered against him, had married Yashasvini four months ago despite her parents' opposition. He had reportedly threatened and blackmailed her family since Sept 2023, coercing the latter to accept his marriage proposal. After marriage, he started harassing her and tortured her whenever she refused to give in to his physical demands. Already on the edge, Yashasvini could not tolerate his wayward behaviour when he demanded that she convince her mother to have a physical relationship with him. Subsequently, she left him and returned to her parent's house. However, Loknath went back to Yashasvini's house and threatened her family, including father Krishna Singh, of dire consequences if she did not return to stay with him.""That is when the daughter-mother duo decided to put an end to the torture. They thought that's the only way to get rid of Loknath. Knowing his vices, they worked on a murder plan and waited for the right opportunity,"" police said.On Saturday morning, Loknath called Yashasvini to inform that he's coming to meet her. Loknath left home in his SUV around 10am after telling his sister that he was heading towards the city. The duo prepared food and mixed it with sleeping pills. Hoping to party with Yashasvini, Loknath had packed a few beer bottles. After picking Yashasvini and the food brought by her, Loknath drove to an isolated space in BGS Layout.They drank beer inside the vehicle. While he got high on alcohol, Yashasvini made him consume the sedative-laced food and, at the same time, shared her location with her mother. When Loknath started feeling drowsy, Hema came with a knife and stabbed him twice in the neck. A shaken Loknath tried to flee; he ran for 150 metres and tried to hide in a parked autorickshaw. Passersby, who reached the spot on hearing his screams, found him dead and alerted police.Deputy commissioner of police (North) Saidulu Adavath said: ""Yashasvini was not willing to continue the marital relationship. She also got to know that he had extra-marital affairs. So they planned and killed him.""","Loknath Singh, 37, was found dead with stab injuries in the neck on Saturday evening.

Additionally, 12 Shiv Sainiks were arrested for vandalizing the studio on Sunday night.The studio later announced its closure, stating it would remain shut until it could ""provide a platform for free expression without putting ourselves and our property in jeopardy.""Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel, who filed the complaint, demanded that Kamra issue an apology within two days or face consequences, stating, ""he won’t be allowed to move freely in Mumbai."" Police indicated they would issue a notice to Kamra, who is currently in Pondicherry.Kamra’s show, recorded on February 2 and uploaded on Sunday, led to Shiv Sena members ransacking the venue. The arrested Shiv Sainiks were produced before the Bandra court on Monday and released on bail with a surety of Rs 15,000 each. Meanwhile, Wagle Estate police in Thane registered a non-cognisable offence against Kamra on Monday.DCP (Zone IX) Dikshit Gedam confirmed that two cases had been registered at Khar police station. ""The first FIR is against the comedian for derogatory comments. The second is against the people who ransacked the hotel. Further investigation is on.""The FIR, initially lodged at MIDC police station in Andheri East before being transferred to Khar, accuses Kamra of mocking Shinde in his performance. MLA Murji Patel stated, ""The video showed Kamra using the word 'gaddar' (traitor) to refer to the Maharashtra deputy CM.""Khar police clarified that they had not arrested Kamra, as the charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita—related to statements causing public mischief and defamation—carry a maximum punishment of less than seven years, meaning an immediate arrest is not mandatory. Kamra will be called for questioning and his statement will be recorded.Among the 12 Shiv Sainiks arrested for vandalism was party functionary Rahool Kanal. Additionally, the non-cognizable offence in Thane alleged that Kamra performed a satirical song about Dy CM Shinde, according to police. This complaint was filed by Rupesh Mishra, a Yuva Sena member from Wagle Estate.Previously, Habitat had hosted controversial episodes of ""India’s Got Latent,"" leading to multiple show cancellations. On Monday, the studio issued a statement on Instagram: ""We invite all artists, audience, and stakeholders to discuss and share their views freely and request your guidance so that we also respect the performers' rights. We are shocked, worried, and extremely broken by the recent acts of vandalism targeting us. Artists are solely responsible for their views and creative choices.""We have never been involved in the content performed by any artist, but the recent events have made us rethink about how we get blamed and targeted every time, almost like we are a proxy for the performer.

Are Trump's policies pushing US economy towards a recession?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/are-trumps-policies-pushing-us-economy-towards-a-recession/articleshow/119507566.cms,"Donald Trump

Actions versus feelings?

How determined is Trump?

Is there a cushion?

Is the US economy headed for a recession? Stocks have plunged. So have measures of consumer and business confidence. Forecasters expect slower growth, higher unemployment and faster inflation than they did just a few months ago - and Wednesday, policymakers at the Federal Reserve said they agreed.The administration has announced and then delayed tariffs; it has ended and then restored programmes. Even some experts who are sympathetic to President Donald Trump's aims worry that businesses will pull back on hiring and investing in the face of so much uncertainty - a word that the Fed chair used repeatedly in a news conference on Wednesday.Most forecasters still don't expect a recession. But they say the chances of one have risen sharply - a turnabout from when Trump took office. How likely is a downturn? Here are three big questions about the Trump economy.The evidence of a slowdown comes mostly from ""soft"" indicators. These are surveys showing that businesses are more reluctant to hire and invest, and that workers are more worried about losing their jobs.""Hard"" indicators - measures of actual activity - haven't shown the same weakness. Job growth was solid in Feb, for example. Retail sales slumped in Jan but rebounded last month, although less than forecasters had expected.Attitudes almost always change before actual behaviour does. A company that loses a contract today probably won't lay off its staff tomorrow; an employee who hears a rumour of job cuts might not immediately cancel a long-planned vacation. And even when behaviour does shift, it takes time to show up clearly in the economic data.But it is also possible that falling confidence won't ever translate into real-world decisions. Consumer confidence was low through much of the Biden administration, for example, but actual spending never faltered. And evidence suggests that sentiment measures have become less reliable in an era of extreme partisanship.Trump made tariffs a centerpiece of his campaign last year. But many people on Wall Street didn't believe he would follow through - in part because if he did, stocks would fall and Trump would reverse course. So far, that has been a losing bet. In his first term, Trump worried when markets fell and bragged when they rose. But when stocks fell after tariff announcements this month, he disregarded the selloff and refused to back down. ""Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down,"" he told reporters last week. He and members of his administration now suggest that a period of economic pain is necessary to balance the economy. (Hardly any economists agree.) Still, Trump could change tactics if the slump worsened.Coming into this year, most forecasters expected economic output to grow about 2%, adjusted for inflation. That's slower than the 2.5% it grew last year, but it's a long way from a recession. Yet even before Trump took office, some forecasters warned that the economy was not as strong as well-known indicators like the unemployment rate suggested. Hiring was slowing; the housing market was frozen in place; consumers were saving less to maintain their spending.""All of these things were pretty obvious even in Dec,"" said Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro Research, a financial firm. He argues that a slowdown in growth was inevitable this year, regardless of who won the election - which would mean that Trump is operating with less of an economic buffer than most people believe.The economy has repeatedly proved doubters wrong in recent years, and it may do so again. But it doesn't take a recession to cause real hardship. Even a mere slowdown in growth could leave hundreds of thousands out of work - and, if history is any guide, send Trump's approval ratings through the floor. That's the kind of outcome presidents usually do everything in their power to avoid.","Most forecasters still don't expect a recession.

Challenges and criticism

The Australian government has unveiled its 2025-26 federal budget, focusing on cost-of-living relief , tax cuts, and support for households, students and businesses.With a general election approaching, Australia’s treasurer Jim Chalmers introduced several measures aimed at easing financial pressure on Australians while addressing key economic challenges, including housing affordability and slowing economic growth, reported Bloomberg.One of the most significant highlights is the extension of tax cuts, which will reduce the tax rate for those earning between A$18,201 and A$45,000 to 14% by July 2027.According to Bloomberg, these cuts will result in an average tax saving of A$2,548 by the 2027-28 financial year.Households and small businesses will also receive automatic energy bill relief, with A$150 deducted from their power bills in quarterly instalments starting in July.This initiative is part of a broader A$1.8 billion package to help Australians cope with rising electricity costs, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.The government has pledged an A$8.5 billion investment in Medicare, expanding bulk-billed health services to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for patients.Additionally, A$689 million has been allocated to lower the cost of medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, with the maximum cost of many medications dropping from A$31.60 to A$25.Student debt relief is another major policy announcement, with the government planning to wipe out 20% of student debt, benefiting over three million Australians.The move, combined with revised repayment thresholds, will cut an average of A$5,400 per student from outstanding loans, amounting to A$19 billion in total debt relief, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.Housing affordability remains a critical issue, yet the budget offers only limited solutions. The government announced an A$54 million investment in modular and prefabricated home construction to speed up development.The Help to Buy shared equity scheme has also been expanded from A$5.5 billion to A$6.3 billion, allowing more Australians to enter the housing market with lower deposits.For infrastructure, major investments include A$7.2 billion for Queensland’s Bruce Highway, A$1 billion for Sydney’s Southwest Rail Link and A$2 billion for Melbourne’s airport rail station upgrades.Despite these initiatives, the budget is projected to return to an A$27.6 billion deficit in 2024-25, deepening to A$42.1 billion in 2025-26. While economic growth is expected to improve slightly, inflation remains a key concern, with the Reserve Bank of Australia carefully monitoring public spending.Defence spending has also drawn attention, with no major new commitments beyond a slow increase to 2.3% of GDP by the early 2030s.This falls short of the 3% defence spending target encouraged by US President Donald Trump, potentially straining Australia’s relations with the United States, as per Bloomberg.With the upcoming election, the Albanese government is balancing economic relief measures with long-term financial sustainability.While tax cuts, student debt relief, and healthcare funding are welcomed, concerns over housing, fiscal discipline and defence spending may shape voter sentiment in the months ahead.","The Australian government has unveiled its 2025-26 federal budget.

Tesla's sales drop nearly half in Europe as backlash against Musk intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/teslas-sales-drop-nearly-half-in-europe-as-backlash-against-musk-intensifies/articleshow/119472948.cms,"(Pic courtesy: X/ Tesla)

(With input from agencies)

Tesla sales in the European Union dropped sharply in the first two months of the year, as Elon Musk's politics and outdated models may be driving consumers away.According to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla's new registrations declined by 49 percent to 19,046 units in the first two months compared to the previous year's same period.This decline occurred despite the EU's overall electric vehicle sales increasing by 28.4 percent to 255,489 units during the same period, achieving a 15.2 percent market share.Tesla faces increased competition from newer Chinese and European electric vehicles, whilst operating with older models.The company's European reputation has suffered due to Musk's support for a German far-right party and his involvement with President Donald Trump's administration, which has had strained relations with the EU.Recent weeks have seen vandalism at various Tesla dealerships across the United States, alongside a substantial decrease in the company's stock value over the past month.In Germany, Europe's largest automotive market, there have been multiple incidents targeting Tesla vehicles, with eight cars being set on fire since 2024 began.These events followed Musk's controversial public support for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party during the recent general election. German Tesla sales decreased by 76 percent in February, following January's 60 percent decline, according to official statistics.While German electric vehicle sales generally decreased after government subsidy cancellation, Tesla's decline contrasts with the sector's overall recovery.Despite upgrades to the popular Model 3 and Model Y, the vehicles maintain their original appearance. European consumers may have been deterred by reliability issues and the Cybertruck recall, despite the vehicle not being available in Europe.ACEA data shows Tesla's market share at 1.1 percent for January and February 2025, with February registrations dropping 47 percent to 11,743 units.Despite a slight market share improvement to 1.4 percent in the following month, Tesla remained behind Chinese manufacturer SAIC's MG brand of electric and hybrid vehicles.The electric car market expanded in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, while gaining momentum in Spain and Italy, the ACEA added.","Tesla sales in the European Union dropped sharply in the first two months of the year.

The 150th anniversary of the Metre Convention in 2025 celebrates international collaboration in metrology . The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has adoptedas the theme, highlighting metrology's role in driving progress and innovation.Over the past century and a half, metrology has evolved, incorporating changes to make it more stable and reliable. A notable example is the 2019 revision of the SI (Systeme Internationale) Units , redefining the kilogram, Ampere, Kelvin, and mole. The field of metrology is almost ancient, though, and not just a twenty first century phenomenon. In ancient Egypt, the standard unit of measurement of length was a cubit, which was equal to the length of the Pharaoh’s forearm, added to the width of his palm. Metrology has traversed a long and interesting journey starting from the age of first principles, then the golden period of the mechanical marvels, leading to the advent of electronics, and later digital, and now we are poised to experience contactless metrology.Let us take the example of the automotive industry, and the regular car you drive. The dimensional accuracy of brake discs is critical to prevent brake failures. Industrial metrology techniques, such as surface measurement and contour measurement, are used to measure the dimensions and surface finish of brake discs, ensuring the safety of drivers and passengers on the road. This is just one example of how industrial metrology impacts our everyday lives.This is but one example of how metrology is not an arcane subject for laboratories but affects us every day. Simply put, metrology is the scientific study of measurement. More pertinently, it is the application of such study to improve our lives.Metrology is not just for academics; it's closely tied to everyday life. Recent advancements include data-driven metrology for real-time analysis and quality predictions, non-contact measurement techniques like confocal microscopy and optical interferometry enable high-speed, high-precision inspections.As metrology integrates with Industry 4.0, smart measuring instruments and IoT devices enable continuous monitoring and adaptive adjustments, ensuring robust quality control with minimal human intervention. Fully automated metrology systems will drive efficiency and cost savings in the future.Leading this push towards the future in India is Mahr Metrology India Pvt Ltd , a 100% owned subsidiary of Mahr GmBH. They offer a wide range of dimensional metrology solutions, including simple callipers, form and surface measuring machines, and non contact measuring systems, to name just a few making them a significant player in the Indian Metrology Industry.Starting as a small family business in the Swabian town of Esslingen, Mahr GmBH has exemplified innovative metrology, and set quality and assurance benchmarks for over 160 years. Not many people know that Carl Mahr, founder of Carl Mahr Holding GmbH in 1862, made one of the very first calipers in 1868. Back then, it was called a caliber.But let’s get back to the future. The future of dimensional metrology is expected to be driven by advancements in automation, data analytics and precision engineering. As industries demand increasingly accurate measurements, Mahr is evolving and pivoting to integrate SMARTt technologies that enhance speed, accuracy, and efficiency.From traditional precision engineering sectors like ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) and power transmission to new-age domains like semiconductors, electronics, mobile telephony, medical implants, Optics, and even aerospace and defence, Mahr offers state-of-the-art cutting-edge solutions like MahrSurf 3D, OptoSurf and Mahr Engineered Solutions.

Hyundai announces record $20 billion investment in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hyundai-announces-record-20-billion-investment-in-us/articleshow/119452125.cms,"Trump: 'Tariffs very strongly work'

'More investments, more jobs, and more money'

South Korea’s Hyundai has unveiled a massive $20 billion investment in US manufacturing , including a $5 billion steel plant in Louisiana, marking the company’s first steel production facility in the country. The announcement was made on Monday at the White House, alongside US President Donald Trump, Hyundai chairman Euisun Chung, and Louisiana governor Jeff Landry.The $5.8 billion Louisiana plant, which will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually, is expected to create more than 1,400 jobs and supply steel to Hyundai’s auto plants in Alabama and Georgia.Chairman Chung called it the auto giant’s largest US investment ever.Hyundai's announcement comes as more global firms ramp up US investments amid tariff concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Japan’s SoftBank, and Apple have all announced major expansion plans in the country. Apple recently pledged $500 billion to boost manufacturing and infrastructure across the US.Speaking at the White House, Trump linked the investment to his trade policies, saying, ""This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work."" His administration had previously introduced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and planned new levies on Asian and European car imports, set to take effect next month.Hyundai’s Euisun Chung acknowledged Trump’s role in the company’s decision, revealing that discussions about the US steel plant began in 2019 during a meeting in Seoul. He added that the announcement coinciding with Trump's second term made the moment ""even more special,"" CNN reported.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the development on social media, writing, ""More investments, more jobs, and more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans – all thanks to President Trump’s economic policies.""While such investment pledges are common during new presidential terms, their success varies. Trump’s 2017 announcement of a $10 billion Foxconn factory in Wisconsin, expected to create 13,000 jobs, ultimately resulted in a scaled-down investment of $672 million, producing fewer than 1,500 jobs.Despite Trump's push to ""save"" the US auto industry, American factories already produce the majority of North American auto production. In 2023, US assembly plants built 10.2 million vehicles, compared to 4 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in Canada.With Trump’s next wave of tariffs set for 2 April, more companies are expected to shift production to the US to avoid trade penalties.","The $5.8 billion plant will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually.

Trump to impose high tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Will it impact India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-countries-buying-venezuelan-oil-will-it-impact-india/articleshow/119450907.cms,"25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil



Will it impact India?



Failure to uphold agreement



The 'dirty 15' countries



US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas—a move that could impact India, China, and others while fueling global trade tensions.""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse. Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.Trump further accused Venezuela of ""purposefully and deceitfully"" sending criminals to the United States, including violent offenders and members of organisations such as Tren de Aragua.Trump has aggressively imposed tariffs on both allies and rivals, using them as a tool to exert economic and diplomatic pressure, since his return to the White House in January.The newly proposed 25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil, affecting both direct and indirect purchasers, could be implemented from April 2, as per Trump's signed directive.The implementation decision rests with the secretary of state, who will consult with other US agencies before determining whether to enforce these levies.These tariffs scheduled for April 2, coincides with Trump's planned announcement of reciprocal tariffs on other nations—a day he calls ""liberation day.""In addition to reciprocal tariffs, he has vowed to impose broad sector-specific duties on imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.The tariffs could impact India and China, as both nations import Venezuelan oil, along with the United States and Spain. Trump confirmed the 25% tariff would be additional to existing rates.The order stipulates that the 25% tariff will cease one year after a country's last Venezuelan oil import, or earlier at Washington's discretion.In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5% of India's total crude oil purchases.In January 2024: The nation's imports increased to above 254,000 barrels per day, representing approximately half of Venezuela's aggregate oil exports, which totalled nearly 557,000 barrels per day during this period.In December 2023: India's crude oil imports stood at roughly 191,600 barrels per day. The distribution amongst companies showed Reliance Industries securing 127,000 barrels per day.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) obtained 37,000 barrels per day, and the HPCL-Mittal Energy received 28,000 barrels per day.Last year in February, Venezuela exported approximately 500,000 barrels of oil daily to China and 240,000 barrels to the United States, according to AFP.Trump's announcement follows last month's suspension of the deportation pipeline between the US and Venezuela, citing Caracas' failure to uphold an agreement to take back migrants quickly. Following this, Venezuela withdrew from accepting these flights.Earlier on Saturday, Caracas announced reaching a new agreement with Washington to resume deportations, resulting in nearly 200 Venezuelan nationals being deported from the US through Honduras.Separately, the Trump administration extended the operational deadline for US petroleum corporation Chevron in Venezuela until May 27. The firm had been functioning under a sanctions exemption.Earlier, during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Washington would approach trading partners to discuss tariff levels and non-tariff barriers.Bessent explained that countries could potentially avoid these levies by discontinuing their current practices.During the same discussion, Bessent mentioned that the tariffs would target approximately 15 percent of nations having trade imbalances with the US, referring to them as a ""dirty 15.""","US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas.

Stocks rose in morning trading (US local time) as Wall Street attempts to navigate uncertainty amid an ongoing trade war . The S&P 500 jumped 1.1%, coming off its first winning week after a four-week losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5%.Wall Street remains focused on how tariffs could impact inflation, consumer spending, and overall economic growth.Stocks have been subject to volatility as tariffs are announced, then either implemented or retracted. Meanwhile, genetics testing company 23andMe plunged after announcing it had initiated voluntary bankruptcy proceedings over the weekend.According to AP, Wall Street was sharply higher before the opening bell on Monday, as the momentum from last week carried over into the new trading week. Futures for the S&P 500 surged 1.1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.9%, and Nasdaq futures climbed 1.4%.Investors focused on corporate news while awaiting updates on US President Donald Trump ’s tariffs, which have caused significant market fluctuations in recent weeks. Genetics testing company 23andMe saw its shares drop nearly 42% in premarket trading after revealing it had initiated voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. The company had laid off nearly half of its staff last fall and was winding down clinical trials while assessing ""strategic alternatives"" for certain assets.Meanwhile, shares in The AZEK Co. surged 20% before the bell on Monday after the building materials company announced it would be acquired by Australia's James Hardie Industries in a cash-and-stock deal valued around $8.75 billion. This marked the second large deal in the sector within a week, following QXO Inc.'s announcement on Thursday that it was purchasing Beacon Roofing Supply Inc. for around $11 billion, including debt.Regarding tariffs, reports suggest President Trump may narrow his broad approach focusing specifically on countries with significant trade surpluses with the US, particularly in Asia. Markets have faced turbulence this year, reacting to each new tariff announcement.The ongoing trade war between the US and its key trading partners poses a threat to inflation and could negatively impact both consumers and businesses. Trump has set an April 2 deadline for implementing additional tariffs on trading partners, following previous deadlines that were often postponed or canceled at the last minute.Chinese Premier Li Qiang struck a conciliatory tone in a meeting with business leaders and US Senator Steve Daines, the first US congressman to visit Beijing since Trump took office in January. Li emphasized the importance of dialogue over confrontation, calling for win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition. The meeting also included leaders from major US businesses such as FedEx Corp., Boeing Co., Qualcomm, and Pfizer.AP’s report also highlighted that recent statements from Trump administration officials suggest that the list of affected countries may not be as broad as initially expected, and existing tariffs, such as those on steel, may not be cumulative. This has sparked optimism in the markets that Trump’s tariff plans may ultimately be less impactful than previously feared.In international markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.4% to 23,787.71, and the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2% to 3,370.03.

India has played a vital role in the impressive growth of California almonds , with 85% of almonds consumed in the country coming from California.Emily Fleischmann, Vice President of Global Market Development at the Almond Board of California (ABC), highlighted India’s contribution to the success of California almonds. India is the largest export market for California almonds, and in the 2023-24 crop year, shipments to India exceeded 400 million pounds, marking a 21% growth compared to the previous year.Fleischmann shared that almonds have become an integral part of daily life in India, whether soaked overnight for children or consumed as a healthy snack by adults. The belief that almonds enhance mental sharpness has also created a unique dynamic in the Indian market.""India has played a critical role in the growth story of California almonds, and the numbers speak for themselves — from 100 million pounds of consumption a decade ago to now over 400 million pounds. California represents 85% of the market share of almonds in India,"" she said in an interview with new agency PTI.In the 2023-24 crop year, California produced 76% of the world’s almonds, with Australia and Spain following behind at 7% each. Other almond-growing countries include Turkey (2%) and Italy, Portugal, Morocco, China, Chile, and Tunisia, each at 1%.Despite being California’s largest export market, Fleischmann emphasized that India’s growth potential for almonds remains substantial. India's per capita almond consumption stands at 0.46 pounds, far below the top-consuming countries like the USA, Germany, and Italy, where consumption exceeds two pounds per capita.The Almond Board is focusing on expanding its reach, particularly in tier II and tier III cities, where 66% of India’s growth is expected over the next decade. The board is promoting almonds in various forms, such as flour, milk, and other products, in response to India’s growing demand for healthy snacking options.Fleischmann also acknowledged the importance of diversifying markets to ensure balanced growth. While India is a primary focus, the ABC is also expanding into other global markets, including Europe, South Korea, Japan, China, Mexico, and emerging markets like Morocco, Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, and South Africa.The ABC, a non-profit organization established in 1950, represents over 7,600 almond growers and 100 processors in California. It promotes California almonds both domestically and internationally through marketing, research, and sustainable farming practices.","India is the largest export market for California almonds.

The price of Brexit: How much is leaving the EU costing UK businesses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-price-of-brexit-how-much-is-leaving-the-eu-costing-uk-businesses/articleshow/119371467.cms,"Representative image

The UK is paying a heavy financial price for Brexit, with new data revealing a significant blow to trade with the European Union . As a result, the government has announced plans to eliminate obstacles hampering trade in an effort to mitigate the economic damage.As per recent figures—official estimates show that Brexit is costing UK businesses £37 billion annually due to reduced trade with the EU, according to report by UK newspaper Independent. According to data presented by UK trade minister Douglas Alexander, UK-EU trade for the period ending September last year was 5 per cent lower than in 2018, when adjusted for inflation and excluding precious metals. This figure comes from calculations by the House of Commons library.Alexander put the blame on the previous Conservative government's Brexit agreement for the substantial losses, declaring that it is ""clear [the agreement] is not working well enough."" He outlined the Labour government's commitment to rebuilding economic ties with the EU and removing unnecessary trade barriers to stimulate growth.The financial loss was highlighted during a parliamentary question from SNP MP Stephen Gethins, who described it as ""an appalling loss of trade at a time when business and the Exchequer can ill afford it."" Gethins criticized the government's ongoing adherence to a ""hard Tory Brexit,"" arguing that it worsens economic conditions while imposing cuts that harm the most vulnerable. ""A hard Brexit makes us poorer and less secure,"" Gethins warned. ""The government must stop punching down on the most vulnerable to balance the books and join the customs union and single market at the very least.""The burden of post-Brexit bureaucracy has also been substantial. The Independent recently reported that Brexit-related paperwork is so extensive it could circle the globe 15 times. David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, directly linked the trade decline to Brexit and urged the government to address regulatory differences that are causing friction.Mike Galsworthy of European Movement UK questioned the rationale for excluding the single market, customs union, and free movement, arguing these were not mandated by the 2016 referendum. Meanwhile, Tom Brufatto from Best for Britain suggested that closer alignment with the EU could increase the UK economy by 2.2 per cent, and called for policies to reduce trade friction ahead of the upcoming UK-EU summit in May.","UK-EU trade for the period ending September last year was 5 per cent lower than in 2018, when adjusted for inflation and excluding precious metals.

Why it matters

India’s dilemma:

China’s overflow problem:

New ‘China Shock’

: India, others in crosshairs

Trump’s trade war is also fueling a second wave of the “China Shock,” a term used by economists to describe the massive economic disruption caused by China’s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse in the early 2000s. Now, as Trump closes the door on Chinese imports, those products are flooding global markets—leading to economic distress in countries from Indonesia to Mexico.

India in the crosshairs: India is feeling the heat. Authorities in New Delhi have launched anti-dumping probes into a range of Chinese products, including solar cells and mobile phone components, to shield domestic industries. Meanwhile, local textile producers are struggling to compete against a flood of inexpensive Chinese garments.

India is feeling the heat. Authorities in New Delhi have launched anti-dumping probes into a range of Chinese products, including solar cells and mobile phone components, to shield domestic industries. Meanwhile, local textile producers are struggling to compete against a flood of inexpensive Chinese garments. The situation in India mirrors what is happening in Mexico and Southeast Asia. As per the Bloomberg report, in Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has linked rising violence in industrial regions to mass layoffs caused by the influx of Chinese goods. “So much of the entry of Chinese products into Mexico caused this industry to fall in our country,” Sheinbaum said.

Indonesia's textile and apparel industry has shed around 250,000 jobs over the past two years, with an additional 500,000 positions projected to be at risk by 2025. This trend would amount to losing roughly one in four industry jobs within just a few years. The pace of these job losses surpasses the so-called ""China Shock,"" during which the US lost as many as 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011.

Thailand has imposed a value-added tax on low-cost Chinese imports. Sanan Angubolkul, the head of Thailand’s Chamber of Commerce, warned that the situation is “very critical, and there’s no time to waste” as the nation deals with a surge of electrical appliances, clothing and other Chinese goods, the Bloomberg report said .

Vietnam has ordered Chinese e-commerce giants to suspend operations.

In Indonesia, garment manufacturers are struggling to compete with cheap Chinese textiles. The Indonesia Fiber and Filament Yarn Producer Association estimates that one in four jobs in the sector could disappear this year.

What they’re saying

Trump’s latest trade moves have sparked strong reactions from business leaders, economists, and government officials:

Donald Trump, on trade negotiations: “We have a powerful group of partners in trade. Again, we can’t let those partners treat us badly… The ones that wouldn’t be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly.”

Howard Lutnick, US commerce Ssecretary: “These policies are the most important thing America has ever had… It is worth it.”

Henrietta Treyz, economic analyst: “Markets remain skittish because this isn’t just about China anymore. Trump’s April 2 tariffs will hit everyone.”

Brian Coulton, Fitch chief economist: “Tariff hikes will result in higher US consumer prices, reduce real wages, and increase companies’ costs.”

""This is China Shock 2.0 or China Shock 3.0. China has this immense manufacturing capacity, and the goods have to go somewhere"" Gordon Hanson, a professor of urban policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, told Bloomberg.

Zoom In: India’s trade battle

India, which is both a competitor and a partner to China, faces unique challenges in this trade war:

The country’s automotive, chemical, and electronics sectors have benefited from Trump’s tariffs on China, as US firms seek alternative suppliers.

However, India also imports heavily from China, meaning that any trade barriers on Chinese goods could raise costs for Indian manufacturers.

Trump’s demand for reciprocal tariffs puts India in a difficult position. If India refuses, it risks losing access to the lucrative US market. But if it complies, domestic industries—especially agriculture and small businesses—could suffer.

What’s next

As the April 2 tariff deadline approaches, several key developments could shape the outcome:

India’s concessions: The Modi government is in talks to lower more tariffs, but it remains unclear if these moves will be enough to satisfy Trump.

China’s retaliation: If China feels further cornered, it could step up its trade offensive, worsening the economic fallout for other countries.

Global recession fears: Economists warn that escalating trade tensions could push the world closer to a recession, with inflation rising and investment slowing.

The bottom line

US President Donald Trump is escalating his global trade war, targeting not just China but also allies like India. As part of his ""America First"" economic strategy, Trump announced that India will face reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, claiming that the country imposes some of the highest duties on US goods.Meanwhile, his crackdown on Beijing is triggering a new ""China Shock,"" as excess Chinese exports flood global markets, disrupting industries and destroying jobs worldwide, a Bloomberg report said. The world’s largest exporter, facing increased trade barriers in the US, is flooding other markets with cheap goods—undercutting local manufacturers and eliminating jobs from Mexico to Indonesia to India.In an interview with Breitbart News, Trump said that while India is a “wonderful nation,” it has tariffs that are unfair to the US. “I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have is they’re one of the highest tariffing nations in the world,” he said. “I believe they’re going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us.”On China, Trump is taking an even more aggressive stance, arguing that Beijing’s economic expansion is hurting American workers and destabilizing industries worldwide. His latest tariffs are designed to curb China’s influence, but they are also causing widespread disruptions in other economies that rely on trade with China.The economic fallout is already visible in Southeast Asia, where Chinese exports—redirected from the US due to tariffs—are undercutting local businesses.Trump’s tariff war is not just a US-China showdown—it’s reshaping global trade patterns, forcing countries like India to make tough choices and wreaking havoc on emerging markets:While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cultivated strong ties with Trump, India is scrambling to reduce trade tensions. In recent weeks, it has lowered duties on bourbon, high-end motorcycles, and certain agricultural goods. More tariff reductions could follow as Indian officials work to avoid a full-scale trade war with the US.With US import barriers rising, Chinese manufacturers are aggressively seeking new markets. The result? An oversupply of Chinese goods in countries like Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil, putting pressure on local producers.A global economic risk: Trump’s tariffs have already rattled markets. As April 2 approaches, uncertainty is growing, with investors worried about inflation and supply chain disruptions. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently noted, “Uncertainty is remarkably high.”Trump’s tariff war is reshaping the global economic order. India is trying to navigate a delicate balance, China is flooding markets with cheap goods, and developing nations are facing a fresh wave of job losses. With April 2 looming, the world is watching to see whether Trump’s hardball tactics will succeed—or whether they will trigger an even bigger economic crisis.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump’s trade war is fueling a second wave of the “China Shock,” a term used by economists to describe the massive economic disruption caused by China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse in the early 2000s.

Ben & Jerry’s argued this decision violated the terms of its merger agreement, which requires consultation with an advisory committee from its board before any CEO can be removed.Unilever, headquartered in London, responded on Wednesday, expressing disappointment over the public nature of the dispute.“Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,” the company said in a statement.Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission. However, tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years.In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would no longer sell its products in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli operations to a local company, which continued selling Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic branding across Israel and the West Bank.Unilever has since revealed plans to spin off its entire ice cream division, including Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 as part of a wider restructuring. The consumer goods giant also owns brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.The strained relationship took another hit last November when Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in a New York federal court, accusing it of attempting to silence the company’s statements supporting Palestinians in the Gaza war.The complaint also alleged that Unilever blocked Ben & Jerry’s from posting about issues it expected to be challenged in a potential second term for Donald Trump, including minimum wage policies, universal healthcare, abortion rights, and climate change.Tuesday’s filing marked an amendment to that ongoing lawsuit, further expanding the gap between the ice cream brand and its parent company.","Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission.

MUMBAI: India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances, yet recipients still lose around 5% of the money sent by relatives abroad in transfer costs.According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) study, the global average cost of sending $200 has fallen (from nearly 9.7% in 2009 to around 6.7% in Q2 2024) but remains above the G20's 5% target and the UN's 3% Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). These costs include fees and exchange-rate markups.India has, however, met the G20 target. Remittance costs were 4.9% in 2023, and just over 5% in the first half of 2024 - below the global average. India is the top recipient, followed by Mexico, China, the Philippines, France, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.Digital remittances, which were 30% of transactions in Q2 2024, are cheaper. India's digital transfers averaged 4%, a percentage point below the national average, ""reflecting the rising role of digitalisation in optimising remittance costs"".Smaller transfers are pricier. Remittances under $200 averaged 4.6%, while $200-$500 transfers were 2.4%.

Microsoft Corp, the biggest backer of Sam Altman's OpenAI , and BlackRock Inc, which has an executive on the artificial intelligence startup's board, are joining forces with one of his chief rivals.Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure. The AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp, which was already named as a technical adviser to the group when it was announced last year, is also formally joining, according to a statement that didn't detail member commitments.Microsoft, which has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, has increasingly been developing AI outside of that partnership. The software giant has created in-house AI models that it believes can compete with OpenAI, Bloomberg reported this month. Musk, also a co-founder of OpenAI, has meanwhile publicly feuded with Altman over the company's efforts to shift to a for-profit structure.The capital demands and enthusiasm for AI have prompted a range of companies and investors to forge alliances to build some of the biggest data centre campuses in the world. US President Donald Trump has touted hundreds of billions of dollars worth of commitments from firms including Softbank Group and OpenAI, which are behind a $100 billion AI investment plan dubbed Stargate.The Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership , or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments - including energy projects - mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink said in the statement.BlackRock and Microsoft last year unveiled the coalition in partnership with MGX, a UAE investment vehicle that is also involved in Stargate, and Bayo Ogunlesi's Global Infrastructure Partners. The companies said at the time they would seek $30 billion of private equity capital over an unspecified time frame and eventually leverage as much as $100 billion in potential investments.","Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Impact of tariffs and economic policies

Adjusting bond holdings to stabilise markets

Inflation and consumer sentiment

Slower growth ahead



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, while signalling that it still expects to cut rates twice before the end of the year. However, officials acknowledged growing uncertainty in the economic outlook as inflation shows signs of persistence and growth projections weaken.In its latest quarterly economic forecast, the Fed revised its expectations for economic growth, predicting a slower expansion this year and next compared to previous estimates. The central bank also anticipates a slight increase in the unemployment rate, projecting it to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2025. Inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target, is expected to climb to 2.7% this year from its current level of 2.5%.""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,"" Fed noted in its post-meeting statement, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers must strike. While rising inflation would typically prompt the Fed to keep rates elevated or even raise them, slowing growth and rising unemployment could necessitate rate cuts to support the economy.The decision to hold rates steady comes as the central bank assesses the broader impact of the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly tariffs. Economists predict that new trade barriers could temporarily push inflation higher, while other measures, such as deregulation, may offset some of those effects by reducing costs.Fed chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariffs have begun to influence inflation, particularly through higher costs on imported goods.""I do think with the arrival of tariff inflation, further progress [on lowering inflation] is probably delayed,"" Powell said during a news conference.Alongside the rate decision, Fed announced a slowdown in the pace at which it is reducing its holdings of US treasury securities.Previously, the central bank allowed $25 billion in treasuries to mature each month without reinvesting the proceeds. Now, it will reinvest more aggressively, limiting the monthly runoff to just $5 billion.This move aims to keep long-term borrowing costs lower by stabilizing Treasury yields, which dipped slightly following the announcement.Despite Fed's efforts to manage inflation, concerns are growing among economists and consumers alike. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that inflation could climb to 3% by the end of the year, up from 2.6% currently, largely driven by import taxes.Consumer sentiment also reflects growing caution, with recent surveys indicating that Americans expect inflation to worsen. If these expectations persist, they could lead to self-fulfilling price increases as people rush to make purchases before costs rise further. Retailers and homebuilders have already signalled potential price hikes on goods and services due to the added pressure of tariffs.While inflation remains a key concern, signs of economic slowdown are also emerging. The economy has shown weaker growth in early 2025, with Barclays cutting its GDP forecast to just 0.7%, down from an earlier projection of 2.5% in 2024.With inflation still above target, growth slowing, and tariffs complicating the economic landscape, the Fed's path forward remains uncertain. Policymakers have signalled rate cuts on the horizon, but the timing and extent of those reductions will depend on how economic conditions evolve in the coming months.","The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

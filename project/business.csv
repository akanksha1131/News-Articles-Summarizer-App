Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are people born between 1981 and 1996. This means, currently their age range is between 28 to 43 years old, precisely.Diwali signifies the start of Samvat 2082 , the start of the new year, making it an auspicious opportunity for millennials to begin their new investing habits.Based on the age group mentioned above, millennials can be categorized into two segments based on their age groups: one is less than 30 years old, and the other is in their late 30s or early 40s. These two groups are in two different stages of their lives; the first category will have different aspirations or goals to achieve, and they will be focused on consumption-oriented goals like purchasing a house, covering marriage expenses, purchasing a car, etc.They will be in an acquisition stage and also moving towards planning for wealth creation . The other category will have achieved most of their aspirations in life and will be looking forward to wealth generation and retirement planning.Millennials typically have a bucket of regular expenses like living expenses, travel expenses, child education expenses, EMIs, rental costs, etc. The key to addressing these challenges is budgeting, where one can set up basic expense percentages like income to expenses should be less than 50%, EMI expenses should be 20 to 25%, and investment portion should be at least 25%; anything above this could be a best. This broad diversification of budgeting helps you to improve financial discipline and meet your obligations comfortably.Diwali is a very common time when individuals get bonuses from their respective organizations, and this lump sum amount can be prudently used towards savings and partially towards celebrations.Apart from this setting goals forms an important aspect and such as creating a basket for each goal, such as short-term goals like paying off small debts and taking a domestic holiday vacation. Medium-term goals like purchasing a car or going on a holiday trip to a dream destination. Long-term goals like retirement planning, purchasing a house, and generational wealth.As we enter this auspicious period, it’s essential to balance your portfolio by including both growth and defensive assets. Equity and real estate are seen as growth-oriented, while gold and debt are considered defensive assets. But each investment option carries a degree of risk; investors can manage those by understanding the underlying risks of each investment option.Investing exclusively in debt products can lead to zero real returns in an inflationary environment, making it essential to pair them with growth assets like equities, which can yield 12-14% returns over the long term. While gold has not consistently outperformed in all five-year timeframes, making it less reliable as a defensive asset compared to debt, real estate has notably underperformed, with most of the properties in urban cities failing to outperform Nifty 50 returns along with liquidity issues.In an asset mix, the primary consideration should be investing across the assets that are low-correlated to each other, like equity and debt. This approach will help to reduce volatility.For instance, an investor Rahul invested a 10 lakhs FD 10 years ago, which had an interest rate of around 6.5%, which helped him a corpus of 18 lakhs, but if he had invested the same in the asset mix of equity and debt, in the same period he could have generated more than 33 lakhs, which is significantly substantial.Thus , diversifying across the asset classes is key to reducing volatility and enhancing overall portfolio stability.Investors can take exposure to equity through multiple options like direct equity, PMS, AIF, and equity MF. However, among all equity, MF is the best choice as it offers diversification and professional management with expertise fund managers, which makes it a cost-effective option to take exposure in equities.These products that offer fixed returns of 6 to 8%, investors have various avenues to invest, such as FDs, debt MFs, PFs, arbitrage funds, etc.No one can predict an unexpected emergency crisis that could be like your medical expenses or any other unexpected expenditure, so having a safety net consisting of your next 6 months to 1 year expenses in liquid corpus helps you to avoid disturbing your investment account for an emergency crisis.Investing during Diwali presents a wonderful opportunity to align your financial goals with the spirit of the season. By considering a well-bounded investment strategy,millennials can create a diversified portfolio, which would keep the darkness away from your portfolio and keep it shining. Investors should also remember to diversify their investments across the asset classes.By following these steps, investors can make informed decisions that lead to sustainable wealth growth and financial security.","Millennials typically have a bucket of regular expenses like living expenses, travel expenses, child education expenses, EMIs, rental costs, etc. The key to addressing these challenges is budgeting, where one can set up basic expense percentages like income to expenses should be less than 50%.

Gold vs Silver buying: Silver presents an attractive option for aggressive investors seeking portfolio diversification and alpha generation beyond traditional equities, believe analysts. Despite the recent surge in domestic prices, which saw silver reach the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark, analysts suggest that investors consider allocating 3-5% of their portfolio to the white metal by buying on dips over the next 1-3 months.Since the beginning of the calendar year 2024, silver has experienced impressive gains, rising by 33.65% to touch the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark. In the past month alone, it has gained 12.5%, outperforming the Nifty 50 index, which returned 12.5% during the calendar year but lost 5.6% over the past month.In dollar terms, silver's performance has been even more remarkable, with gains of 47.25% and 13.56%, respectively, over the same periods.Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP-Research and Advisory at Master Capital Services, attributes the increasing market value of silver to its extensive use in various industries.""Silver is extensively utilised in electronics, solar panels, batteries, and increasingly in semiconductors, making it a critical component in modern technology. The growing industrial demand for silver along with the anticipation of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve is causing an increase in the metal's market value,” he told ET.Also Read | Silver better than gold for investment? Silver prices cross Rs 1 lakh mark! Manav Modi, a bullion analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, highlights the factors supportingsilver prices , including ""Rising industrial demand, high domestic imports, ETF buying by investors and Fed rate cuts have been supportive for silver.""While acknowledging the possibility of profit-booking following the sharp rally, Modi advises investors to view major dips as buying opportunities. He projects that silver could reach Rs 1.25 lakh per kg over the next 12 months.As advancements in technology continue and the need for electronic devices and semiconductors grows, the demand for silver is expected to remain strong, leading to a sustained upward trend in prices.Bhavesh Jain, co-head of Hybrid and Solutions Funds at Edelweiss Asset Management, stated, ""Silver has seen a strong long-term bullish break; the trend could likely continue supported by lower rates for longer and the revival in Chinese industrial activity."" Jain suggests that investing in silver ETFs is a more convenient option for investors compared to purchasing physical silver.Also Read | Looking to beat fixed deposit returns? Here’s what investors can consider instead of FD However, some fund managers believe that the long-term prospects of silver will be influenced by the adoption and adherence to climate change and green technology initiatives by major global economies.Vikram Dhawan, head of commodities and fund manager at Nippon India Mutual Fund, explained, ""If investors believe in Earth's rising temperature problem and its consequences, silver can serve as a proxy hedge.""Nirav Karkera, head of research at Fisdom, advises, ""Aggressive investors could buy on every fall and allocate 5-15% of their portfolio to the white metal.""Dhawan pointed out that in the short term, silver prices may be affected by a Republican victory in the US, as Donald Trump is not known for his environmentalist stance and instead favors fossil fuels.Considering the anticipated volatility, the upcoming US elections, and uncertainty regarding further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, wealth managers recommend that investors consider staggering their silver purchases.","Since the beginning of calendar year 2024, silver has experienced impressive gains, rising by 33.65%.

(AI image)

Should you buy gold this Dhanteras 2024 ? Dhanteras, a day considered auspicious for purchasing gold, is being celebrated in India today on October 29, 2024.. Despite a 30% surge in the yellow metal's price since the previous Dhanteras, investing at current levels may still be a wise choice, feel experts, and investors have various options to consider.Experts believe that investing in gold will yield attractive returns in the future, despite the rally over the past year.According to an ET report, Anuj Gupta from HDFC Securities recommends buying gold around Rs 75,500–76,000 and accumulating on dips in the range of Rs 73,500–73,700, with a price target of Rs 85,300–87,000 until the next Dhanteras. He says the stop loss should be at around Rs 71,500 level.“We expect that investing in gold will reap benefits in the future and it will provide attractive returns notwithstanding the rally in the past one year. Geopolitical and economic uncertainties, significant global ETF inflows, dovish monetary policy by western central bankers, the US election, and a lower dollar index continue will support the bullish trend in gold,” he was quoted as saying.Ventura Securities sees an upside to Rs 85,700 per 10 grams in gold, with support at Rs 77,000, while silver prices may reach Rs 1,06,000 to Rs 1,20,000, with support at Rs 95,500.However, investors with a short-term view should be cautious, as prices may subside after the sharp uptick. Amit Goel from Pace 360 expects gold prices to decline over the next few months before resuming their long-term bull run, as the asset class is currently overheated.Investors have several options for buying gold, including physical gold (jewellery, bars, and coins), gold ETFs , gold SIPs, digital gold, and gold futures.Prathamesh Mallya from Angel One calls gold a ""portfolio diversifier for investors"" and suggests it could be a substitute for equities in the near to medium term for less risk-averse investors.While the demand for gold jewellery during Dhanteras and Diwali 2024 may be under pressure due to record-high prices, jewellers expect demand to persist, particularly due to the ongoing wedding season and the cultural significance of gold during these festivals. Consumers may gravitate towards lightweight jewellery and coins, though volume-based demand may struggle.Gold ETFs have seen significant growth in India over the past four years, with investors increasingly inclined to invest in gold via the mutual fund route. Vishal Jain from Zerodha Fund House highlights the advantages of gold ETFs, including high purity, secure storage, full insurance, and the flexibility and cost-efficiency of ETFs.Gold SIPs and digital gold are also viable options for investors looking to regularly invest in gold without the need for physical storage.However, experts advise against investing in Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) at the moment, as they are trading at a premium and may experience lower liquidity.","Dhanteras, a day considered auspicious for purchasing gold, is being celebrated in India today on October 29, 2024.

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%.

Tata's 3 prized guns go to Mehli Mistry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tatas-3-prized-guns-go-to-mehli-mistry/articleshow/114927026.cms,"MUMBAI: Ratan Tata , who bequeathed the bulk of his assets to his philanthropic foundation and family members, however, transferred the ownership of three of his most cherished possessions - a pistol, shotgun and rifle - to Mehli Mistry , a longtime friend and business confidant. The weapons which were rarely used by Tata, despite being one of the country's oldest gun licence holders, were either gifts or bequests from people closest to him.One of them is believed to have been a gift from Sumant Moolgaokar, who was chairman of Tata Motors before Ratan Tata succeeded him in 1988; Moolgaokar enjoyed hunting before wildlife protection rules came into force. The other two firearms were inherited by Tata, one from his father Naval Tata and the second from JRD Tata, who was the longest-serving chairman of the Tata Group . These firearms were more symbols of his personal connection with these three individuals. Sources said Tata has transferred their ownership to his confidant and Tata Trusts trustee Mehli Mistry through his will.According to J Sagar Associates partner Lalit Kumar: ""Legally acquired firearms can be bequeathed but the beneficiary should have the license to hold, possess and use them."" Following Ratan Tata's recent passing, his weapons were surrendered to the police armoury. To reclaim these weapons, Mistry must obtain a licence, citing their use for self-defence, sporting activities, or ornamental purposes. Sources said he could also register these firearms under his existing licenses, if he possesses any. Indian regulations have become stricter regarding firearm ownership, restricting the number of licensed weapons per individual.It is anticipated that Mistry will likely opt for the ornamental category. If he does, the police will deactivate the firing pins, rendering the weapons incapable of discharging ammunition. In addition to the firearms, Tata's beachfront property in Alibaug has also been bequeathed to Mistry. Their association dates back decades, starting when they resided at Bakhtawar, a residential building situated in Colaba, Mumbai. Tata later relocated to Halekai, a three-storey residence, also in Colaba, after retiring as Tata Group chairman in 2012.Mistry, who co-manages M Pallonji Group with his brother Pheroze, gained attention during the legal dispute between Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry. Cyrus, who was removed from the chairmanship of the Tata Group in 2016, claimed that the M Pallonji Group had received preferential treatment due to Mehli's connection with Ratan Tata. The Supreme Court dismissed these allegations. During this period, Mistry, who is Cyrus's cousin, purchased Rs 235-crore worth of Tata Power shares in support of Ratan Tata's stance, before ultimately exiting the energy company. In Oct 2022, Mistry joined the boards of Tata Trusts, the philanthropic organisation controlling the $165-billion Tata Group.","Ratan Tata transferred the ownership of three of his most cherished possessions - a pistol, shotgun and rifle - to Mehli Mistry.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Ten years later, the Union Budget 2024 presented by us a few days ago is Rs 48 lakh crore, which is three times, Modi said.Modi also said that the capital expenditure allocation under his governments has grown manifold.""Capital expenditure is called the biggest productive medium of resource investment,"" he said at the ‘Journey Towards Viksit Bharat: A Post Union Budget 2024-25' conference. In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government. PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest. He also noted the time when India had been ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’ economies in the world. Modi said that his governments have progressively helped India move from a state of vulnerability to a place of strength.PM Modi also said that in a world where most economies are struggling with low growth and high inflation, India stands out as an economy which is seeing high economic growth and low inflation. He also said that India's fiscal prudence has become an example for the world to see.Modi spoke of the government's initiatives to transform the manufacturing sector of the economy with steps like 'Make in India', Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, liberalisation of FDI norms, setting up of multi-modal logistics hubs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first Union Budget of the newly elected NDA government on July 23, 2024.","PM Narendra Modi said that in 10 years, his government has tripled India’s Budget.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

US Elections

& Fed

MUMBAI: Foreign investors sold about Rs 94,000-crore ($11.2 billion) worth of Indian stocks in October - the biggest monthly outflow ever - triggered by elevated stock valuations in India and lucrative prices in China, NSDL data showed.FPIs , or foreign portfolio investors, have a huge influence on Dalal Street, and their latest flight has dragged key indices down by up to 8% from their highs in the previous month, experts said.While domestic funds, riding on SIPs, were able to cushion the impact to some extent, the sensex & Nifty still slid about 6% in Oct. It was the largest monthly decline since the March 2020 pandemic panic for Nifty, Bloomberg reported.""The current wave of FPI selling was triggered by the Chinese stimulus measures and the cheap valuations of Chinese stocks. The elevated valuations in India made India the top choice of FPIs to sell... FPIs may continue to sell thereby putting a cap on any possible up move in the market,"" V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services , said in a note.Another factor contributing to the selloff is slower-than-expected corporate earnings growth. ""Consumption has emerged as a weak spot while select segments of BFSI (banking, financial services, & insurance) are seeing asset-quality stress,"" a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.""Investors should focus on stock-specific investment where Q2 results have been good and earnings visibility is bright... Banking data indicates that deposit growth has caught up with credit growth and this augurs well for banking stocks, which are fairly valued. Public capital expenditure is likely to pick up in the second half of the fiscal and this augurs well for cement stocks,"" Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services said. According to experts, growth in corporate earnings will be a key driver of market returns in the coming year.In the near term, however, all eyes will be on the US elections & the Federal Reserve's rate move. Financial markets across the globe will watch these two decisions keenly. The results of the US elections would set the directions for markets to a great extent in India.""Global markets will respond to the US presidential elections for a few days, after which fundamentals like US GDP growth, inflation and rate cut by the Fed will influence market moves,"" Vijayakumar said.The US Fed is widely expected to cut rates for the second consecutive time in its meeting that ends on Thursday. Typically, a Fed rate cut is a positive sign for emerging markets like India - as more global fund managers chase higher returns.While no one knows how Tuesday's US elections will turn out, Donald Trump's return to the White House could unsettle the Fed and global markets. Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and his threat to intrude into some of the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, the Associated Press news agency reported. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts, the report added.","Foreign investors sold about Rs 94,000-crore ($11.2 billion) worth of Indian stocks in October.

Three friends turn cold chain green,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/three-friends-turn-cold-chain-green/articleshow/114917299.cms,"Shaivee Malik, Vivek Mahindrakar and Dharmik Bapodara first met at IIT Delhi. “I was doing my B Tech in production and industrial engineering, Vivek and Shaivee were doing B Tech in mechanical and biotechnology engineering respectively,” says Dharmik Bapodara. “I first met them when I joined the formula racing club of our college in my first year. We used to design, develop and test formula style single-seater electric race cars that would go 0-100 in just 3.5 secs!”“Back then we spent most of our time in the garage. We would even sleep there and directly go to classes in the morning,” says Bapodara. “The team used to run like a mini startup where students had to manage everything from funds and sponsors to recruitment, manufacturing and testing.”After graduation, the trio decided to start their own venture. In early 2022, Yotuh Energy was born, its name derived from the Sanskrit word ‘yotuhu’, which means ‘act of cleaning’. “We were working in clean tech – taking the cold chain from grey to green — and chose the name Yotuh Energy for our startup,” says Bapodara.The real idea bulb moment came during market research. “In the fifth month of our market study phase, we visited a transporter standing outside the cold storage while the AC unit was continuously on and grumbling about fuel cost. That’s when we decided to work on electrifying the refrigeration chain,” says Bapodara. Yutoh makes electric refrigeration units for intra-city mid-mile logistics, the first to enable Tata Ace and EVs into the cold chain with electric refrigeration units; diesel-based AC units do not fit in small commercial vehicles. Yotuh has its own fleet of refrigerated vehicles in Chennai (Tata Ace and Tata Ace EV) and plans to expand it to Bengaluru and Coimbatore.Yotuh applied for grants and other equity free funding options for its initial requirements. It’s first was a NIDHI EIR grant (dept of science and technology) from IIM Udaipur Incubation. That money was used to make a prototype and test it with a transporter. “After that, we have received multiple grants and awards and won some cash prize challenges,” says Bapodara. That list includes the RAFTAAR grant (PABI) by the ministry of agriculture, a seed grant by Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (incubator), a seed fund from IIT Madras Incubation Cell (incubator), the NEXUS Program startup grant award from US Embassy, the Carbon Zero Challenge 4.0 prize by IIT Madras and the TIDE 2.0 EIR by IIM Visakhapatnam (ministry of electronics and IT).The Yotuh team moved to Chennai after spending a year in Delhi. “We got to know about this opportunity to get incubated by IIT Madras and DICV,” says Bapodara. The team’s first call with Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala (former head of IITM Incubation and Research Park) was a game changer. “He did not ask much about our idea at first. He asked more about ourselves ... After a few rounds of evaluation we got in,” says Bapodara.Sine July 2023, Yotuh has since been working out of IIT Madras Research Park in Chennai. This Aug, it raised 1.53 crore from Campus Angels Network. It also got Cavinkare founder C K Ranganathan as a major investor and auto industry veteran Vinod Dasari as advisor. “For our next phase, we are looking at anywhere between $2.5 million and $3 million,” he adds. “We have orders from our pilot customers and will start delivering by Dec,” he says. Currently Yotuh’s production facility in Ambattur can make around 30 units a month.","Yotuh Energy makes electric refrigeration units for intra-city mid-mile logistics.

This year’s data underscores the need for proactive measures to mitigate such spikes, particularly in neighbourhoods with larger populations of vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, newborns, and the elderly.

In the morning, despite the winds, some areas of the city remained quite polluted — Anand Vihar had an AQI of 385, RK Puram 352, and IGI Airport, 337.At 35.17%, stubble burning was the worst polluter on Friday, a day after Diwali, as per data from the Decision Support System of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology under the Union ministry of earth sciences. While no data on the contribution of stubble to pollution was given for Saturday, local transport was responsible for 14% of the city's PM2.5. However, as the winds calmed down in the afternoon, the pollution levels in these areas worsened. By 6pm, the AQI at Anand Vihar had touched the ‘severe' level at 407.According to weather analysts, it is likely that wind speed will drop further and, therefore, worsen the pollution status.

Former Nvidia programmer discovers world's largest prime number,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/former-nvidia-programmer-discovers-worlds-largest-prime-number/articleshow/114876222.cms,"Luke Durant , a 36-year-old former Nvidia programmer, transformed his interest in prime numbers into a significant achievement as he discovers world's largest known prime number officially named M136279841 and contains 41,024,320 digits, according to CNN. He spent nearly a year and significant personal funds to discover the first prime number breakthrough in almost six years.This discovered number belongs to the Mersenne prime category, named after French monk Marin Mersenne, who researched these numbers in the 17th century. Durant's finding is particularly notable as it's the 52nd known Mersenne prime, a special category of numbers that can be expressed as 2ᵖ-1.""The historical record of the world's largest prime tells us something about the historical capability of computers, and in particular it tells us something about the progress of humanity in this area,"" said Dr Kevin Buzzard, professor of pure mathematics at Imperial College London.The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search ( GIMPS ), announced Durant's discovery on October 21. This community project enables non-experts to participate in discovering large prime numbers, according to Buzzard.""I recognized that the GIMPS community has put together an incredible system with amazing technology for searching for huge prime numbers,"" said Durant, adding that he utilized the project's software and cloud computing to create a high-speed computing system.GIMPS consists of global volunteers who use the project's software on their computers to search for new primes, along with mathematicians who study Mersenne results for future research.Durant's motivation stems from his interest in large computing systems and physical laws' limitations regarding computing capabilities.""I wanted to push the boundaries of the known universe in whatever small way I was able. These enormous prime numbers are, in some senses, the largest 'unique pieces of information' in the known universe,"" he said.","Luke Durant, a 36-year-old former Nvidia programmer, discovered world's largest known prime number officially named M136279841 and contains 41,024,320 digits.

OMAHA: Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than USD 325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway 's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions. Berkshire said it sold off more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The stake valued at USD 69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth USD 174.3 billion.Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to USD 26.25 billion, or USD 18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealised paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of USD 12.77 billion, or USD 8,824 per Class A share.Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire's bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at USD 10.09 billion, or USD 7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's USD 10.8 billion, or USD 7,437.15 per Class A share.The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report operating earnings of USD 7,335.11 per Class A share.Berkshire's revenue didn't change much at USD 92.995 billion.

The ""Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2024: Insights for COP29 "" report, published by global think tank Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), said climate finance currently represents only 1 per cent of global GDP, far short of the required level.Emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) may need around 6.5 per cent of their GDP by 2030 to meet climate goals.""While global climate finance has made some strides, a much more ambitious, cohesive, and effective approach is essential to address the vast funding gap,"" said Barbara Buchner, CPI''s Global Managing Director.""The data from CPI's Global Landscape report leaves no doubt that investment needs to scale across all fronts -- domestically, internationally, and across sectors -- to reach our mutual climate goals. COP29 is an opportunity to establish clear, collaborative commitments to finance the transformation needed for a sustainable future.""Annual climate finance flows rose from $ 674 billion in 2018 to $ 1.459 trillion in 2022. However, a fivefold increase is still needed to reach the $ 7.4 trillion required annually through 2030 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report said.Alarmingly, fossil fuel investments continued to rise globally throughout 2023 and 2024, surpassing $ 1 trillion despite global commitments to reduce fossil fuel investments. Subsidies for fossil fuel consumption in emerging economies increased fivefold during the same period, it noted.At the UN climate conference in the UAE in 2023, countries reached a historic agreement to transition away from fossil fuels.At this year's UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries are expected to agree on a new climate finance target that developed countries need to provide to developing countries, beginning in 2025, to combat and adapt to climate change.The CPI's report warns that economic losses by 2100 could be five times greater than the climate finance needed by 2050 to stay within the 1.5-degree Celsius limit.The report also said that adaptation finance more than doubled from 2018 to 2022, reaching $ 76 billion. However, annual adaptation flows have reached just one-third of the volume needed each year from 2024 to 2030 in EMDEs alone.According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in 1992, high-income, industrialized nations -- which have historically benefited from industrialization and contributed most to greenhouse gas emissions -- are responsible for providing finance and technology to help developing countries combat and adapt to climate change.These countries include the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and EU member states such as Germany and France.Developing and poorer countries view an ambitious new climate finance goal as crucial to increasing climate action. They argue that expecting them to do more, especially when many are still grappling with poverty and inadequate infrastructure amid worsening climate impacts, undermines the principle of equity.","Global investment in combating and adapting to climate change reached nearly $ 1.5 trillion, doubling between 2018 and 2022.

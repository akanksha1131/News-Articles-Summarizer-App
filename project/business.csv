MPC meeting: RBI's three day monetary policy discussions begin today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mpc-meeting-rbis-three-day-monetary-policy-discussions-begin-today-another-repo-rate-cut-coming/articleshow/125732317.cms,"Another rate cut? Here's what experts say



The RBI’s three-day monetary policy committee meeting opens in Mumbai on Wednesday, marking the start of the central bank’s latest policy review. Over the course of the discussions, members of the six-member panel is set to hold discussions on how the central bank should navigate policy, in accordance with the newest growth and inflation readings.The meeting will be conducted from December 3 to 5 and the results of the monetary discussions will be announced by RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra at 10 AM on Friday.The review is taking place during a phase in which the economy is showing considerable resilience while prices are cooling at an unprecedented pace.As the Reserve Bank of India prepares to announce its decision this week, the latest economic data has presented a contrasting backdrop — rapid economic expansion on one hand, and historically low inflation on the other.India’s GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY26, a pace of growth that has encouraged expectations of stability in policy action. Economists say the momentum may have extended into the October–December period as well, supported by firm rural demand and improving urban consumption patterns.At the same time, inflation has fallen sharply. Consumer price inflation dropped to a series low of 0.25% in October, driven largely by a decline in food prices.Forecasts suggest this softness could persist and even settle below the Reserve Bank’s own earlier projections.Commenting on the conflicting economic signals, Mehul Pandya, MD and Group CEO of CareEdge Ratings, highlighted how they complicate rate decisions. ""Both these developments (of a continued strong GDP growth and multi-year low inflationary levels) are mutually opposing forces from an interest rate perspective. Central banks usually do not tend to cut interest rates during the periods of strong economic activity, represented by GDP growth. At the same time, the central banks usually respond to a low inflationary environment by cutting interest rates,"" ANI quoted Pandya as saying.Some industry voices believe the data now gives the central bank enough headroom to ease policy. Taking an optimistic view, Mayur Modi, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Moneyboxx Finance Limited, argued that robust growth has widened the RBI’s scope for action. He said, ""With inflation easing to multi-year lows and remaining comfortably within the RBI's tolerance band, the probability of a repo rate cut has strengthened meaningfully. Softening price pressures give the MPC more room to prioritise growth without risking macroeconomic stability."" Modi added that a well-timed reduction could help lift consumption cycles and stimulate credit demand across key segments.Despite growing speculation of a cut, an assessment by Bank of Baroda suggests that the central bank will keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.50% and maintain its neutral stance. The report pointed out that economic performance has continued to beat expectations, with urban spending and a resilient rural economy expected to sustain momentum into the third quarter. It also flagged signs of recovery in private investment, supported by a rise in credit demand.","The RBI’s three-day monetary policy committee meeting opens in Mumbai on Wednesday.

Winning formula — and weak spots

Financial scoreboard

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Online shopping platform Meesho is set to open for subscription on Wednesday, attracting investors with a solid grey market premium. The excitement has been fuelled by positive commentary from analysts.The company is targeting proceeds of Rs 5,421 crore from the IPO, which will remain open until 5 December. The price band has been set between Rs 105 and Rs 111 per share, valuing Meesho at Rs 50,096 crore ($5.6 billion) at the upper end.Its current grey market premium is hovering around 45%, according to ET.What makes this debut particularly significant is the backdrop: India’s e-commerce ecosystem is tilting towards lower-ticket shopping, unbranded merchandise and regional sellers. This shift has benefited Meesho more than any other large platform.Ahead of the IPO, the SoftBank-backed e-commerce platform Meesho has secured a little over Rs 2,439 crore from anchor investors ahead of its initial public offering. The anchor tranche attracted demand of more than Rs 80,000 crore, translating to nearly 30 times oversubscription, according to market sources.A total of 60 investors participated in the anchor book, featuring a mix of leading domestic institutions and major global names.The Government of Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Tiger Global, Fidelity Funds, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were among those allotted shares, as per a circular uploaded on the BSE website.On the domestic side, allocations were made to SBI Mutual Fund, UTI MF, Tata MF, Motilal Oswal MF, Axis MF, Bandhan MF and HSBC MF, among others. In total, Meesho allotted 21.97 crore equity shares at Rs 111 per share.The issue consists of a fresh share sale worth Rs 4,250 crore and an offer for sale of 10.55 crore shares estimated at Rs 1,171 crore at the upper band.Meesho has stated that funds raised will be deployed towards investment in cloud infrastructure, marketing and brand spending, inorganic expansion through acquisitions and other strategic plans, and general corporate purposes. The company is expected to debut on the stock exchanges on December 10.ICICI Direct has assigned Meesho a subscribe rating, citing strong funnel expansion, better operating performance and attractive relative valuation.SBI Securities has also recommended subscribing while emphasising that Meesho’s path to durable profitability will require ongoing monitoring as investments in tech, marketing and engineering continue.""The company is still loss-making, but the market is clearly betting that its rising order volumes and improving operating efficiency will help it turn profitable in the coming years. However, the risk is that Meesho must prove it can convert this scale into sustainable profits. In a competitive e-commerce industry, high valuations for loss-making firms can change quickly if growth slows or costs rise. For now, the optimism is about future potential, not present profits,"" Ishan Tanna, research analyst at Ashika Institutional Equity Research told ET.With interest from retail investors running high, a solid GMP and largely favourable brokerage outlook, Meesho’s listing is shaping up to be one of the most closely followed market events of the year and could signal how India’s mass-market digital consumption trend will be valued on the public exchanges.A major differentiator for Meesho remains its zero-commission model, which has drawn a large pool of sellers and helped build a very wide catalogue focused on unbranded and regional products. In H1FY26, the marketplace recorded 15.4 crore daily active product listings, sharply higher year on year.At the same time, the business still leans heavily on cash-on-delivery, a format that heightens cancellation and fraud risks and increases operational costs. Competition stays intense too, including in logistics, seller acquisition, affordability features and product discovery, with large rivals capable of spending more aggressively.Even so, many analysts say Meesho sits squarely inside the fastest-growing part of Indian e-commerce and has already shown a degree of capital efficiency uncommon in scaled tech listings.Between FY23 and FY25, the company recorded a 46% jump in annual transacting users, far ahead of the broader industry’s 11–20% growth. In FY25, 19.9 crore customers placed orders on Meesho, and 17.4 crore of them came from outside the biggest eight metropolitan markets, underlining the platform’s deep presence across Tier-2 and Tier-3 India.The shopping platform ended FY25 with revenues of Rs 9,389.9 crore, marking a 23.3% year-on-year expansion. EBITDA losses have narrowed substantially across two years, though the company remains loss-making overall, reporting an adjusted FY25 loss of Rs 2,595.3 crore. According to ICICI Direct, improving unit economics and operating leverage mitigate long-term concerns despite the losses.","Online shopping platform Meesho is set to open for subscription on Wednesday.

Gold Price Outlook :

Weekly Bias:

Gold: Sideways, Silver: Volatile

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices may continue to trade with a positive bias this month, though some volatility is expected, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his views and recommendations for gold and silver investors:Bullion’s witnessed a positive outgoing week as the Silver price roared from below $50 to around $58.85 per troy ounce in spot driven by persistent shortage of white metal in global markets and soaring rate cut expectations. The rise in the price of Silver thus eclipsed that of Gold with the Gold/Silver ratio subsequently falling to an annual low of just over 73.Silver inventories registered on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell to their lowest level in 10 years, and those on the Shanghai Gold Exchange to their lowest level in more than nine years last week being triggered by China's record exports of 660 tons in October. These apparently went to London, where shortages had occurred in October. The Silver ETFs tracked by Bloomberg recorded inflows of a good 290 tons in last week, which withdrew supply from the market and is also likely to have contributed to the price increase.Data released from the World Gold council also showed that Central bank demand for gold remained robust in October, totalling 53t (+36% m/m) and continuing the strong trend seen throughout the year. Buying remained concentrated among a small number of central banks, led by the National Bank of Poland which became active again during the month.Data on Monday also showed US manufacturing contracted for the ninth straight month in November. Investors are now looking out for Wednesday's November ADP employment report and Friday's delayed September PCE Index, for clues on a Fed interest rate cut at the central bank's meeting next week. Traders are currently pricing in an 87% chance of a December Fed rate cut, per CME's FedWatch tool. Markets are also waiting on President Donald Trump's announcement of the new Federal Reserve chairman, with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett reportedly emerging as a frontrunner. Hassett, like Trump, favors lower interest rates.Bias remains positive for the month amid volatility that could persist in the current week ahead of the all important US Fed meet on 10th Dec.Rate-cut expectations drove a lot of the move in bullions complex last week as traders priced in nearly 90 % odds of a December cut with Fed officials, including Christopher Waller & John Williams, reinforced the dovish narrative while Silver rose on thin liquidity as supply tightness drove the market.Going ahead for the week, the main trend remains up for the bullions complex though volatility amid profit booking moves could also persist especially for Silver prices. A weaker dollar could provide support at lower levels with the dollar index settling at 99.479, down 0.72% on last week.Traders could also monitor any announcement of potential tariff on silver after the precious metal was added to the US Geological Survey list of critical minerals in November. While 75 million ounces have left the vaults of the Comex futures exchange in New York since early October, fears of a sudden premium for US silver could keep some traders to hesitate before shipping metal out of the country keeping sentiments volatile for Silver prices.","Gold prices may continue to trade with a positive bias this month, though some volatility is expected, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

India to lead global sales: Scotch Whisky Association,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-lead-global-sales-scotch-whisky-association/articleshow/125755956.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: India will lead sales of scotch globally as rising disposable incomes and lower import duty — once the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) comes into play — will spur demand and drive greater engagement between whisky companies of the two countries, the top body representing Scotch whisky makers has said.The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), that has global giants such as Diageo, Pernod Ricard, William Grant & Sons, Whyte & Mackay and Suntory Global Spirits as members, however, continues to remain cold to demand of Indian makers to recognise spirit matured for less than three years as whisky. “If it doesn’t meet the parameters of our domestic (UK) legislation, it can’t be called whisky,” Mark Kent, chief executive of SWA told TOI recently.Speaking on the trade agreement, which is likely to come into force around the middle of next year after ratification from the UK Parliament, Kent said CETA will not only help in lowering prices but will also lead to creation of new jobs and investments across the UK and India.The new jobs are going to be not just in the distilleries, but even in farms that are growing barley. “So, all through the value chain, from farmers planting barley to the people serving the whisky, you will see a boost.You’ll be looking at jobs getting created through bottling, through the hospitality sector, tourism upskilling. This goes in both directions.”Speaking about the importance of this engagement for scotch makers, Kent said India is their biggest market. “We export to 180 different markets around the world, so we’re global. However, the Indian whisky industry is twice as big as the Scotch industry. The market is going to be even more important in the future as the economy grows and we see more disposable incomes. India is the biggest. So, that’s very important. ”He said that SWA expects a 9-10% reduction in scotch prices once the deal is in force. “Apart from being affordable for Indians, the lower prices will also help Indian makers who import bulk scotch for IMFL… It gives you an opportunity to improve the quality of your products because you can add more scotch.”Also, he said that newer scotch brands will also be interested in coming to India. “Also, there are Indian companies who are looking at setting up distilleries in Scotland. So, we are starting to really see a build-up of partnerships.”","The India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) will spur demand and drive greater engagement between whisky companies of the two countries.

Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike

The rupee continued its downward journey against the US dollar on Thursday, slumping to a record low of 90.43 in early trade. The Indian rupee crossed the significant 90-level barrier against the US dollar on Wednesday, reaching an intra-day low of 90.29 before closing at 90.19. This continued depreciation raises concerns about its impact on the broader economy.According to an SBI research team analysis, this represents the fastest Rs 5 decline against the dollar, with the Indian currency falling from 85 to 90 in under a year, despite the RBI's interventions to stabilise the currency. The rupee's value continues to be influenced by external factors, unlike the stock market index. Ongoing Foreign Portfolio Investment withdrawals, substantial trade deficits from high-cost imports of oil, metals and electronics, alongside a strong dollar maintain pressure on the currency.Since April 2, following Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement, the currency has depreciated by 5.5%. Foreign portfolio investors have withdrawn more than $17 billion this year, whilst private equity firms have cashed out their investments through substantial IPOs from prominent startups, contributing to capital outflows from India. The situation has worsened in recent months due to increased gold and silver prices, resulting in unprecedented imports and trade deficit in October.But the government is not worried. V Anantha Nageswaran, the chief economic adviser, said that the government ‘is not losing sleep’ over rupee's decline. Nevertheless, he anticipated improvement in the currency's value next year. Regarding foreign direct investment, Nageswaran expressed optimism, stating, ""We may cross $100bn this year.""The depreciation of currency increases import costs across sectors from petroleum to consumer electronics, leading to inflationary pressures and higher expenses for international education, healthcare, and tourism. However, it proves beneficial for overseas remittances and export revenues during a period when the economy faces challenges from substantial 50% US tariffs.Experts indicate that whilst currency depreciation risks importing inflation, a regulated decline addresses multiple challenges for the central bank.

Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike

Weaker Rs. to raise cost of imports

Uday Kotak

MUMBAI: The rupee broke the psychologically crucial 90 mark against the US dollar for the first time and slid to an intra-day low of 90.29 against the greenback on Wednesday before settling 32 paise below Tuesday’s close at 90.19, extending a decline that now threatens to spill over into the wider economy.The currency has weakened 5.5% since Trump’s reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2. So far this year, foreign portfolio investors have withdrawn over $17 billion, while several private equity players have cashed out during billion-dollar IPOs by some of the marquee startups, adding to outflows from India. What has heightened the pressure in recent months is higher gold and silver prices, which resulted in a record imports and trade deficit in Oct.A report by SBI research team said in terms of number of days, this is the quickest Rs 5 fall against the dollar as the Indian currency slipped from 85 to 90 in less than a year, despite RBI seeking to intervene to check a steep fall.A weaker currency raises the cost of imports — from fuel to electronics — putting pressure on prices, while making overseas education, travel and medical treatment more expensive.It, however, makes remittances from overseas as well as export earnings more attractive at a time when the economy is grappling with the impact of steep 50% tariffs in the US.Bankers said while a weaker rupee raises risks of imported inflation, a controlled depreciation will solve several problems for the central bank. It would improve share valuations in dollar terms, address the current account deficit and help the RBI conserve its reserves.Unlike the sensex, rupee remains hostage to the outside world. Persistent FPI exits, a record trade deficit driven by costly oil, metals and electronics imports and a firm dollar have kept pressure on the currency. “This breach of 90 triggered multiple stop losses, and RBI’s intervention capped the fall with an all-time low of 90.21 for now,” said forex consultant K N Dey, who attributed part of the slide to bets in the offshore market against the rupee and “net negative equity inflows of more than $18 billion since Jan 2025. ”Even last week’s 8.2% GDP data, he said, failed to lift the sentiment. Until recently, equities and the rupee moved in tandem: foreign money flowed in, the currency strengthened and the BSE sensex rallied; money flowed out, rupee slipped and markets corrected. That rhythm snapped this week. Sensex climbed past 86,000 even as the rupee broke 90 per dollar for the first time, signalling a structural break in the traditional linkage between Dalal Street and the FX market.","The currency has weakened 5.5% since Trump’s reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2.

JLR’s design chief asked to leave: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jlrs-design-chief-asked-to-leave-report/articleshow/125755820.cms,"MUMBAI: Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reportedly removed its long-time design chief Gerry McGovern in a sudden and unexpected move, just days after PB Balaji stepped in as the new CEO. According to AutoCar India, McGovern, 69, was asked to leave on Monday and was escorted out of JLR’s office. The reason for his dismissal is not clear.The development brings an abrupt close to McGovern’s association with JLR, which spans more than two decades. During his tenure, he played a central role in shaping some of the company’s most iconic modern vehicles, including the reborn Defender SUV and multiple generations of the Range Rover lineup. His design philosophy helped position JLR’s cars as global symbols of luxury, modernity and British automotive identity.JLR’s parent Tata Motors declined to comment, while McGovern didn’t respond to a WhatsApp message.McGovern was also known to be part of the late Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata’s close automotive circle. Tata, deeply passionate about cars and personally involved in the company’s product development, had given McGovern considerable creative freedom.People familiar with their working relationship said Tata trusted his instincts and encouraged his design choices.After Tata’s death last year, McGovern became vulnerable to internal changes and leadership shifts, AutoCar India noted.Beyond his work with JLR, McGovern has also contributed to design and creative strategy at Norton Motorcycles, the iconic British motorcycle brand owned by TVS Motor Company. TVS Motor chairman emeritus Venu Srinivasan is a trustee of JLR’s ultimate shareholder Tata Trusts, where Tata’s half-brother Noel Tata is now the chairman.The people said McGovern’s work for other brands while employed at JLR did not sit well with Tata Group’s leadership.The management shake-up comes at a challenging time for JLR, which is still recovering from a severe cyberattack that recently disrupted production across multiple facilities. As the company navigates this transition, all eyes will be on how Balaji, the first Indian CEO at the British carmaker, reshapes JLR’s future direction.","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reportedly removed its long-time design chief Gerry McGovern.

BofA Securities has a neutral rating on PB Fintech (Policybazar) with the target price of Rs 1,980. Analysts said that the company’s management sees no GST-led negative impact on health and term policies, some impact on savings business but they’re working to address the same in the next 3-6 months. Most insurer contracts on combined operating ratio. They said that with lower operating expense and better claims ratio, PB is better placed to negotiate with insurance companies. PB is focused on driving healthy growth, they said.Jefferies has a buy on Chalet Hotels with the target price at Rs 1,070. Analyst said that the company reaffirmed its metro dominance at its analyst meet, citing institutional partnerships, mixed-use expertise and industry-leading execution. The hospitality company is focused on ‘Big Box’ city assets and leisure properties, complemented by selective commercial real estate. Since listing, Chalet has added 1,050+ keys and has another 1,180 in the pipeline. The company prefers to balance brand tie-ups with a selective rollout of ATHIVA, its new upper-upscale brand tailored to each property’s potential.CLSA has an outperform rating on Hindalco with the target price raised to Rs 965.Analysts estimate that even at an LME price of $2,600 (spot $2,850), ongoing capacity and margin expansion initiatives could double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) in the next five years, with significant free cash flow generation in the back half. They said in the near term, concerns at Novelis (capex escalation and fire in a plant) are likely to be offset by strong aluminium price outlook. The management was constructive on aluminium price outlook, they said. The company’s capacity addition in Indonesia (as China approaches its ceiling of 45 metric tonne) could face challenges on power availability. They also said that the demand is resilient.Citigroup has upgraded HDFC AM to neutral from sell with the target price raised to Rs 2,850. Analysts upgrade the stock on a number of factors. For one, the fund house shows sustained strength in performance across most key actively-managed high-yielding categories. It has an elevated focus on scaling up non-MF businesses. Also, there’s limited visibility of any near-term regulatory overhang. On the other hand, elevated competitive pressure and reducing distribution moats for incumbents remain the key concerns.Macquarie has an outperform rating on ITC with the target price at Rs 500. Analysts believe concerns on high per-stick taxes shared in draft excise document are misplaced, as such rates represent the cap and not the applicable rates. They see potential moderation in discounting post move to GST as a percentage of retail price, and moderation in leaf tobacco costs driving 10%+ FY27 EBIT growth in cigarette business. Analysts raised ITC’s earnings per share estimates and target price by 2% and 4%, respectively, to factor in these tailwinds.

MUMBAI: In the first three days of the current month, foreign funds have net sold Indian stocks worth more than $800 million, thus weighing on the rupee, market players said. So far in 2025, net outflow by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from the cash segment of the stock market was $17.3 billion, data from NSDL showed.This was mainly because at the start of the year, the valuation of the Indian market was at a much higher level compared to several other emerging markets, they said. Unlike previous occasions when strong foreign fund selling used to pull the leading stocks indices down, this time, however, despite the strong selling, sensex and nifty near their life-high levels, riding on the strong and steady flow of funds through the mutual fund route. Data from AMFI shows that till Nov this year, mutual funds alone have received nearly Rs 2.75 lakh crore (over $32 billion) gross inflow through the SIP route.The weakness of the rupee has affected investor sentiment and sensex has been on a downward path for the last four sessions. Since Nov 27, the day it breached the 86K mark to reach a new high after 14 months and then scaled a new high at 86,159 points the next day, the sensex has lost over 1,000 points to its Wednesday close at 85,107 points.Although stocks from most sectors have seen their prices slide, software exporters have seen their stocks go northward.“Out of the major sectors, IT was the only notable gainer, supported by renewed buying in export-oriented technology stocks,” said Hitesh Tailor, Research Analyst, Choice Equity Broking. “The rupee’s weakness and improved global IT sentiment helped (stock prices of large software exporters) sustain upward momentum. Stocks such as Wipro, TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and HCL Technologies posted gains, with Wipro and TCS leading the pack,” Tailor said in a note.When rupee weakens, exporters usually see their revenues in rupee term grow as they get more rupee for the same amount of dollar or other major currencies in which they earn through exports. Other than the software exporters, historically, pharma, textiles and gems & jewelry sectors have also gained from the rupee’s weakness.","In the first three days of the current month, foreign funds have net sold Indian stocks worth more than $800 million.

‘Challenge to our system’: Malaysia cracks down on illegal Bitcoin mining; power theft losses reach $1.1 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/challenge-to-our-system-malaysia-cracks-down-on-illegal-bitcoin-mining-power-theft-losses-reach-1-1-billion/articleshow/125757144.cms,"AP file photo

Malaysian authorities are stepping up their crackdown on illegal Bitcoin mining after uncovering nearly 14,000 illicit sites over the past five years and reporting about $1.1 billion in power-theft losses for state utility Tenaga Nasional (TNB).With cases rising sharply, including around 3,000 power-theft incidents linked to mining recorded by early October, the government last month launched a cross-agency taskforce involving the finance ministry, Bank Negara Malaysia, and TNB to coordinate action against rogue operators.Bitcoin mining in Malaysia is legal, provided operators obtain electricity legitimately and pay the required taxes. However, illegal miners use racks of high-powered “rigs” that perform trillions of calculations to validate transactions and earn coins, often tapping stolen electricity to keep their operations running.“Even if you run it properly, the challenge is that the market itself is very volatile,” Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, the deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, quoted as saying by Bloomberg. “I don’t see any well-run mining that can be considered as successful legally.”Authorities are using a range of tactics to track illegal Bitcoin mining operations. Drones sweep over rows of shops and abandoned buildings, detecting unexpected heat signatures from machines that shouldn’t be running.On the ground, police deploy handheld sensors to identify irregular electricity use. At times, investigations rely on residents reporting unusual sounds, which have revealed miners masking the roar of their machinery with natural noises.Illegal operators are increasingly cautious, frequently moving between empty storefronts and deserted houses. They use heat shields to conceal the glow of their rigs and secure entrances with CCTV, heavy-duty locks, and broken-glass deterrents to prevent unauthorised access. Together, these measures illustrate the lengths both authorities and miners go to in the ongoing effort to enforce the law.“The risk of allowing such activities to happen is no longer about stealing,” said Akmal. “You can actually even break our facilities. It becomes a challenge to our system.”Globally, Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than the entire countries of South Africa or Thailand. According to a report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, over 75 per cent of mining activity now occurs in the United States. Malaysia’s share of the industry is less clear. In January 2022, the country accounted for 2.5 per cent of the global hashrate, a measure of computational power, but Cambridge has not published updated figures in its latest survey.Around 80 per cent of the country’s domestic electricity is generated from coal or natural gas. Across the region, fossil fuels continue to make up roughly three-quarters of the power mix, according to the International Energy Agency, as cited by DW.Last week, Malaysia’s Ministry of Energy Transition and Water announced the formation of a multi-agency committee to tackle the rising problem of electricity theft linked to cryptocurrency mining.","Malaysian authorities are stepping up their crackdown on illegal Bitcoin mining.

Squeezed between China and US

The European Union on Wednesday rolled out a multi-billion-euro strategy to reduce its dependence on China for rare earths, unveiling measures to boost domestic mining, refining and recycling capacity amid rising geopolitical pressure on critical supply chains.The plan comes after months of turbulence triggered by Beijing’s export controls, according to AFP, which have disrupted manufacturers in autos, electronics and defence and exposed the bloc’s vulnerability to raw-materials shocks.EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said the bloc was “responding to the new global geopolitical reality” as the European Commission announced nearly €3 billion to support strategic projects both within the EU and in partner countries. He has previously likened China’s dominance to a rare-earths “racket”.A central feature of the new push is a European Centre for Critical Raw Materials, designed as a supply-hub modelled on Japan’s state-run JOGMEC. The centre will monitor demand, coordinate joint procurement for member states, and manage stockpiles and emergency deliveries to companies.Brussels also proposed curbing exports of scrap and waste from permanent magnets starting next year, to stimulate domestic recycling.Targeted restrictions on aluminium waste will follow, and copper could be added later.Despite adopting a critical raw-materials law two years ago, the bloc finds itself caught between Beijing’s tightening export regime and intensified US efforts under President Donald Trump to secure mineral access through bilateral deals.A new survey by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China found that 60% of European firms expect supply-chain disruptions due to Chinese government restrictions, while 13% fear they may need to halt or slow production.Updating its “economic security” doctrine the same day, the Commission said global trade tensions had made existing vulnerabilities sharper. “Trade is being weaponised. Supply chains are under pressure,” EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said while presenting the plan.“Strategic choke points are turning economic dependency into political pressure, and this hits our companies every single day,” he added.The revised doctrine calls for more assertive use of tools such as foreign-investment screening, export controls and supplier diversification — and for developing new mechanisms where gaps persist.“Europe will continue to champion open trade,” Sefcovic said, “but our openness must be backed by security.”","EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said the bloc was “responding to the new global geopolitical reality’ EU Commission announced nearly €3 billion to support strategic projects both within the EU and in partner countries.

EU says no to Russian gas: European Union aims to ban supply by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-says-no-to-russian-gas-european-union-aims-to-ban-supply-by-2027-what-is-the-whole-plan/articleshow/125738538.cms,"Putin Wages War On Europe? DESTROYS EU Leaders For ‘Sabotaging’ Trump’s Peace Plan | Watch

What has EU planned?





Freezing Russian assets





The European Union has agreed on a timeline to completely halt Russian gas imports by autumn 2027, marking a significant escalation in efforts to curb Moscow’s energy revenues as the war in Ukraine approaches its fourth year.The agreement was reached during overnight talks between EU institutions and national governments, ending months of negotiations over how quickly the bloc should detach itself from Russian supplies. The result reflects middle ground between EU capitals and the European Parliament, which had pushed for a faster deadline.EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen hailed the breakthrough on X, writing, “We've made it: Europe is turning off the tap on Russian gas, forever,” adding, “We've chosen energy security and independence for Europe. No more blackmail. No more market manipulation by Putin. We stand strong with Ukraine.”According to the plan, no new long-term pipeline gas contracts with Russian suppliers will be permitted beyond September 30, 2027, as long as storage levels are considered sufficient, and not later than November 1, 2027.Long-term deals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will stop even sooner, from January 1, 2027, in line with earlier calls from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.Firstly, short-term arrangements will be ending. LNG contracts will cease from April 25, 2026 and pipeline gas contracts from June 17, 2026.In a statement, the European Council said the measure is designed “to end dependency on Russian energy following Russia's weaponisation of gas supplies with significant effects on the European energy market.” The package now awaits formal approval by both the European Parliament and EU member states.The deal provides a legal exit mechanism for companies already tied into Russian supply agreements, allowing them to cite “force majeure” as justification for terminating contracts once the ban applies.The same agreement instructs the European Commission to draft a road map to eliminate Russian oil imports to Hungary and Slovakia by the end of 2027. Both countries were granted exemptions when the EU cut back Russian oil purchases in 2022, and Hungary has signalled resistance to change. Last month, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, considered the closest EU leader to the Kremlin, pledged during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin that he would continue buying Russian hydrocarbons.The latest move comes against the backdrop of a substantial reduction in Russian gas imports since 2021. Before the invasion, 45% of the EU’s imported gas came from Russia. By 2024, that share had fallen to 19%. Europe has sharply cut pipeline deliveries but has partly replaced them with LNG shipped by sea. Russia remains the EU’s second-largest LNG supplier after the United States, accounting for about 20% of LNG imported in 2024 — roughly 20 billion cubic metres out of 100 billion.Imports of Russian LNG into the bloc are expected to reach €15 billion this year, highlighting the financial significance of the embargo once fully enforced.The bloc also plans to use Russia's frozen assets to help Ukraine's economy and war efforts over the next two years. The country's budget and military requirements for 2026 and 2027 will land somewhere around 130 billion euros or $150 billion,which EU has promised to fulfil. Since the war began back in 2022, the bloc has already injected more than 170 billion euros, according to AP.However, the country having most of the assets has rejected the plan.Belgium, where majority of the money is held – having almost 194 billion euros, has refused to use Moscow's frozen assets, saying that the plan major financial and legal risks.Apart from Belgium, Russia also has funds in Japan, with $50 billion, US, UK and Canada, which have comparatively lesser amounts, as of June.Belgian foreign minister Maxime Prevot said that his country considers “the option of the reparations loan the worst of all, as it is risky. It has never been done before.” Russia also flagged the scheme as “theft.”Prevot said, “We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return.”Responding to Belgium's concerns, EU said that they indeed do understand the issue.“We take Belgium’s concerns seriously,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told AP.“They are justified, but the issue can be resolved. It can be resolved if we are prepared to take responsibility together.”Belgium has been collecting tax revenue from the frozen Russian assets, and the interest generated is helping finance a G7-backed loan programme for Ukraine.However, the European Central Bank has raised concerns that a proposed EU reparation loan could weaken international confidence in the euro. EU leaders are expected to take up the plan — along with discussions on Ukraine’s economic and military requirements — at the Brussels summit scheduled for December 18.","EU agrees on timeline to completely halt Russian gas imports by autumn 2027.

The two figures now commanding the most attention are the private-sector jobs reading from payrolls group ADP, scheduled for release later on Wednesday, and the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index coming on Friday, the inflation measure the Fed relies on most heavily.Money markets currently assign around a 90% likelihood to a December 10 rate cut and anticipate three more reductions during the course of the next year.Adding to the broader market mood are reports that President Donald Trump’s senior economic adviser Kevin Hassett, known for advocating deeper rate cuts, is now the frontrunner to succeed Jerome Powell when the Fed chair’s term expires in May.Still, analysts pointed out that the policy board does not appear aligned on whether monetary decisions should be driven more by persistent inflation pressures or weakening employment conditions.One area offering relief came from the American retail sector, where the National Retail Federation reported a record turnout for the “Black Friday” shopping period. According to the industry group, 202.9 million consumers made purchases across the five-day stretch, beating projections and reflecting what the NRF described as a “highly engaged consumer”.Following the latest gains on Wall Street, most Asian markets also registered advances. Tokyo climbed by more than one per cent, while Seoul, Sydney, Singapore, Wellington, Taipei and Jakarta all traded higher. Losses were recorded in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Manila.Meanwhile, Bitcoin pushed back above the $90,000 mark after almost 10% was wiped from its value earlier in the week during a broad shift away from risk assets.

‘Tesla is ridiculously overvalued’: Big Short investor Michael Burry warns Musk’s $1 trillion payout will erode value,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-is-ridiculously-overvalued-big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-musks-1-trillion-payout-will-erode-value/articleshow/125727364.cms,"Michael Burry says dilution is eating into Tesla’s real worth

A broader critique of tech’s accounting habits

Market reaction and mixed sentiment

Big Short investor Michael Burry has cast doubt on Tesla’s lofty valuation and warned that CEO Elon Musk ’s newly approved $1 trillion compensation package could place even more strain on shareholder returns. In a weekend post on his Substack newsletter, Burry wrote that the electric-vehicle maker’s market value is “ridiculously overvalued” and has been “for a good long time”. His critique focuses largely on how Tesla and other tech firms account for stock-based compensation, which he believes distorts the way investors perceive true profitability.Burry explained that Tesla’s share count increases by roughly 3.6% each year because the company routinely awards employees significant amounts of stock. Since Tesla does not buy back shares to counterbalance these awards, existing shareholders effectively own a smaller slice of the company each year.He shared a chart with his subscribers to illustrate how this steady dilution can erode a company’s present value, especially over long periods. According to Burry, when the real cost of stock-based compensation is fully considered, Tesla’s valuation looks much less defensible than its headline numbers suggest.He also pointed to Musk’s newly approved pay package as a major accelerant. The plan, which passed with 75% shareholder support, could give Musk tens or even hundreds of millions of new Tesla shares if performance targets are met. This could take Musk’s personal stake from 15% to roughly 29%, reducing the ownership percentage of every other shareholder.“Dilution is certain to continue,” Burry wrote, adding that this structural issue is a core reason he believes Tesla’s market value is disconnected from reality.Burry directed part of his criticism at the wider technology industry. He said many tech companies remove stock-based compensation from their “adjusted” earnings results, creating a version of profitability that overlooks a major recurring expense. He argued that companies such as Tesla, Amazon and Palantir routinely benefit from this practice because it makes their financial performance appear healthier than it truly is.He reinforced his point by referencing Warren Buffett, who has long argued that stock-based pay is a real cost to shareholders and should never be treated as an optional footnote.Tesla’s share price dipped slightly after Burry’s comments circulated, although the stock is still up more than 6% this year. Tesla remains valued at about $1.43 trillion.Burry also commented on Tesla’s shifting identity. He said the company’s strongest supporters have changed their narrative repeatedly over the years, moving from electric vehicles to autonomous driving and now to humanoid robots. In his view, this frequent repositioning reflects a company that is constantly searching for its next big justification for growth.The remarks were published on Burry’s newly launched Substack, Cassandra Unchained, which he started after deregistering Scion Asset Management. Many of his recent posts focus on what he believes are emerging bubbles in multiple sectors, particularly artificial intelligence.","Big Short investor Michael Burry says Tesla’s market value is ‘ridiculously overvalued’ His critique focuses largely on how Tesla and other tech firms account for stock-based compensation, which he believes distorts the way investors perceive true profitability.

Philanthropy boost: Michael and Susan Dell pledge $6.25bn for ‘Trump Accounts’ launch; major gift aims to spur families to sign up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/philanthropy-boost-michael-and-susan-dell-pledge-6-25bn-for-trump-accounts-launch-major-gift-aims-to-spur-families-to-sign-up/articleshow/125721819.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday announced a $6.25 billion commitment to encourage American families to open the new children’s investment accounts created under President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, according to AP. The pledge is intended to reach 25 million children under the age of 10 by seeding each eligible account with an initial deposit.The Dells’ gift stands out globally for its size, with few single philanthropic contributions in the last 25 years surpassing even $1 billion, let alone several billion. Announced on GivingTuesday, they believe it is the largest single private commitment ever made to support US children.The contribution will operate through investment accounts administered by the US Department of the Treasury and managed by private firms. The accounts — dubbed “Trump Accounts” in the legislation — are part of a programme passed into law on July 4 and scheduled to launch on July 4, 2026.“We believe that if every child can see a future worth saving for, this program will build something far greater than an account. It will build hope and opportunity and prosperity for generations to come,” said Michael Dell, whose net worth is estimated at $148 billion, AP reported.Through their pledge, the Dells will deposit $250 into each qualifying child’s account. Dell said they chose the launch date to coincide with the 250th anniversary of US independence. “We want these kids to know that not only do their families care, but their communities care, their government, their country cares about them,” said Susan Dell.Under the new law, the Treasury will automatically deposit $1,000 for children born between Jan. 1, 2025 and Dec. 31, 2028, with all funds invested in a stock-market index fund. Families of other children will need to contribute themselves, and the accumulated balance can be used at 18 to pay for education, housing or to start a business.The Dells hope their contribution will push families to claim the accounts and add even small deposits over time while also encouraging companies and philanthropists to participate.“It’s hard to give effective dollars away at scale, particularly to the country’s neediest kids in a way that you have confidence that those dollars are going to compound with the upside of the U.S. economy,” said venture capitalist Brad Gerstner, who supported the legislation and is founder of the Invest America Charitable Foundation, which is helping the Treasury launch the accounts.Gerstner said the initiative aims not only to give young people a financial start but also to ensure they share in the gains of the economy. “Fundamentally, we need to include everybody in the upside of the American experiment. Otherwise, it won’t last,” he said.AP noted that only 58% of US households held stocks or bonds in 2022, with the wealthiest 1% owning nearly half the value of all stocks, while the bottom 50% held about 1%. In 2024, about 13% of US children and young people lived in poverty, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, reflecting the lack of social supports such as paid parental leave.The Dells’ contribution will be directed to children living in ZIP codes with median family incomes of $150,000 or less. While the Trump Accounts may help young adults with long-term saving, the initiative will not immediately reduce child poverty. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and child-care benefits in the spending package are expected to diminish short-term support for low-income families.Ray Boshara, senior policy adviser with both the Aspen Institute and Washington University in St. Louis, welcomed the multi-sector contribution model. He said the concept resembles other landmark programmes that improved over time. “The ACA, Social Security – they start off fairly flawed, but get much better and more progressive and inclusive over time,” he said. “It’s a down payment on a big idea that deserves to be improved and there’s bipartisan interest in improving them. ”Through the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, the couple has reported giving $2.9 billion since 1999, with a strong focus on education. Michael Dell said they had not initially expected to commit so much to the new accounts, but Susan Dell said the scale grew as they assessed the programme’s long-term potential. “We’re thrilled to be spearheading this in the philanthropy sector and are so excited because we know that more people are going to jump on board,” she said.",Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell announced a $6.25 billion commitment to encourage American families to open the new children’s investment accounts.

Investors leaned back into technology counters while weighing signals on global interest rates and the broader health of the economy.The S&P 500 was 0.3% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 37 points, or 0.1%, at 9.35am Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. MongoDB surged 24.6% after the New York-based database company reported stronger quarterly results than analysts expected. United Natural Foods of Providence, Rhode Island, also advanced 8.4% following a better-than-anticipated profit.Those moves helped offset a 5.6% slide in Signet Jewelers. The company issued a holiday-season revenue forecast that missed market expectations and said it anticipates “a measured consumer environment.”US economy has held up comparatively well, though widening divides persist. Lower-income households remain under pressure from inflation that is still running above preferred levels, while higher-income households benefit from an equity market near the all-time high set in late October.In the bond market, yields were mixed after the previous day’s sharp moves. The 10-year Treasury yield nudged up to 4.10% from 4.09%, while the two-year yield eased to 3.52% from 3.54%. Higher yields can weigh on valuations across asset classes, particularly for sectors considered expensive.Bitcoin, which had fallen below $85,000 on Monday, recovered toward $89,000.Monday’s climb in yields followed comments from the Bank of Japan hinting it may raise interest rates soon. Market expectations still point to another US Federal Reserve rate cut at next week’s meeting in Washington. The Fed has already reduced its overnight rate twice this year to support a slowing job market, though inflation remains above the 2% target, leaving the subsequent policy path uncertain.Overseas, markets moved modestly across much of Europe and Asia.

Turning to ChatGPT



SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son revealed that he “was crying” when he sold the company’s stake in Nvidia, highlighting how reluctant he was to part with the fast-rising chipmaker. This emotional exit raises a key question — what compelled Japan’s second-richest man to give up the shares despite not wanting to?Speaking at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo on Monday, Son addressed SoftBank’s November disclosure that it had sold its full Nvidia holding for $5.83 billion. He said that the move was driven purely by the need to raise capital for AI investments and not lack of confidence in Nvidia.He acknowledged the emotional difficulty of the sale and stressed that the shares would not have been offloaded if SoftBank did not need the money.“I don’t want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects,” Son said during the event, as cited by CNBC.“I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.”His comments reflect the explanation provided by analysts and SoftBank executives in November, when they described the sale as part of broader efforts to bolster the SoftBank Vision Fund’s cash resources for AI.SoftBank has intensified its focus on artificial intelligence this year through a series of projects, including plans for Stargate Project data centres and the acquisition of US chip designer Ampere Computing.SoftBank’s AI push also includes a substantial bet on OpenAI. The Japanese company could “potentially” increase its investment in the ChatGPT maker depending on performance and the valuation of further rounds, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke to CNBC.Earlier this year, Son said SoftBank was “all in” on OpenAI and predicted that the AI startup would one day become the most valuable company in the world. The bet has already delivered financial benefits, with SoftBank reporting last month that its second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen ($16.6 billion), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.Questions around the scale of investment going into AI have fuelled market concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble. Son pushed back against that view during his speech on Monday, arguing that critics are underestimating the sector.He said that those who talk about an AI bubble are “not smart enough” and predicted that “super [artificial] intelligence” and AI robots will generate at least 10% of global gross domestic product over the long term, which he said would outweigh trillions of dollars of investment in the technology.",SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son revealed that he “was crying” when he sold the company’s stake in Nvidia.

Trade reset: China issues rare earth licences; questions persist over wider access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-reset-china-issues-rare-earth-licences-questions-persist-over-wider-access/articleshow/125719367.cms,"‘Good Policy In Place’: Rare Earth Expert On India’s National Critical Minerals Mission

Auto-linked suppliers receive clearances

Gap remains between Beijing and Washington

China’s rare earth industry is set for faster shipments to select buyers after authorities issued the first batch of new export licences, a step that follows months of disruption caused by Beijing’s tighter controls earlier this year. The move reflects a key outcome of the Donald Trump–Xi Jinping summit, according to Reuters.The approvals mark a shift from a system that forced companies to apply for each shipment individually, a process that created shortages across the auto supply chain and strengthened Beijing’s leverage in trade talks with Washington. Reuters reported that the new “general licences” were designed to ease those pressures and allow exports under year-long permits for specific customers.A source told Reuters that China has now granted these licences to several major suppliers, including JL Mag Rare Earth, Ningbo Yunsheng and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech, though some clients are still awaiting approval.JL Mag has received general licences for nearly all its customers, while Ningbo Yunsheng and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech have secured approvals for part of their client base, the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.The three companies and China’s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to questions.All three firms serve the automotive industry among others, according to their websites. JL Mag operates a subsidiary in Europe, and Ningbo Yunsheng says it supplies clients in Europe and the Americas.The new permits will add to, rather than replace, the existing licensing system. For now, only large Chinese rare earth companies qualify for general licences, though eligibility could widen if the rollout proceeds smoothly, the source added.The development narrows, but does not close, differences in how Washington and Beijing described the leaders’ summit in South Korea. The White House portrayed the general licences as effectively ending China’s rare earth controls, while Beijing has offered little public commentary and no indication its broader regime will be dismantled.It also remains unclear how widely the new licences will be granted or whether certain customers — including defence, aerospace or semiconductor-linked sectors — may be excluded.European companies, meanwhile, again raised concerns on Monday about delays and limited transparency in the existing export-control framework.","China's rare earth industry is set for faster shipments to select buyers after authorities issued the first batch of new export licences.

Bitcoin meltdown: Strategy stock tanks over 60%; retail ETF wipe-outs spark fresh fears for major benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-meltdown-strategy-stock-tanks-over-60-retail-etf-wipe-outs-spark-fresh-fears-for-major-benchmarks/articleshow/125718058.cms,"Leveraged bets unravel

Funding strain and index threat

Retail investors who chased Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin vision are now confronting heavy losses, as the turmoil around Strategy Inc.’s stock intensifies and leveraged products tied to it unwind sharply.The rout has erased gains built during the crypto mania and left funds tracking the company’s volatile bets struggling to retain assets. The developments were reported by Bloomberg.Strategy -- once seen as a simple route to hold Bitcoin through a listed stock — has dived more than 60% from recent highs. The company said on Monday that it had created a $1.4 billion reserve to manage dividend and interest payouts, a step meant to ease concerns it might be forced to sell Bitcoin if prices fall further.For many investors, that reassurance came too late. MSTX and MSTU, two funds offering double the daily return on Strategy’s stock, have each fallen more than 80% this year, placing them among the 10 worst performers in a US ETF universe of more than 4,700 products. A third fund, MSTP, launched in June, has dropped by a similar amount. Together, the trio has shed about $1.5 billion in assets since early October.Retail interest had originally surged when firms such as Defiance and Tuttle Capital Management rolled out these high-octane products to mirror one of Wall Street’s most visible Bitcoin-proxy trades.Strategy shares slid 34% in November. Bitcoin, down roughly 30% from its October peak, trades near $87,000, while the stock closed Monday 3.3% lower after falling as much as 12% during the day. Bitcoin advanced 0.5% as of 6.20am in London on Tuesday.“The recent pullback in Bitcoin has hit Strategy’s stock hard, and 2x leveraged plays like MSTX and MSTU turn that into even larger losses,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at ETF shop TMX VettaFi. “It’s a reminder that leveraged single-stock ETFs can look great on the way up, but can erase gains very quickly when the underlying trade goes the other way.”Defiance declined to comment. Tuttle Capital and GraniteShares, which is behind MSTP, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.At the centre of the market’s worries is mNAV, a metric comparing Strategy’s enterprise value with its Bitcoin holdings. The premium embedded in that ratio has largely evaporated, pulling it to about 1.15, a level executives have described as a caution zone. CEO Phong Le said on a podcast that slipping below 1.0 could force the firm to sell Bitcoin to meet payout obligations, though only as a last resort.The new reserve, financed through recent equity sales, covers at least 21 months of dividend and interest payments. But it has not quelled concerns over Strategy’s dependence on leverage, its reliance on retail flows, and the strain on its capital model.To keep buying Bitcoin, Strategy has repeatedly issued common stock — a move that dilutes existing shareholders. With its valuation premium narrowing, the company has shifted towards preferred shares and other costlier capital to sustain its crypto strategy.The ETF ecosystem linked to Strategy is also struggling. At least 15 products tied to the stock are currently trading, many down double digits this year. Combined assets for MSTX, MSTU and MSTP have fallen from more than $2.3 billion in early October to about $830 million, Bloomberg data show.The broader crypto slump — despite increased institutional participation and political support from the Trump White House — has dragged down miners, altcoins and firms with token-heavy treasuries. Leveraged ETFs, popular with at-home traders earlier this year, are among the hardest hit.These funds aim to deliver double Strategy’s daily move. In volatile markets, compounding returns — known as volatility decay — can steadily erode performance even if the underlying stock ends flat. When Strategy’s shares dropped and whipsawed, the ETFs amplified the losses.“Leveraged ETFs are generally a dangerous investment. A leveraged ETF on shares of a stock that levers up to buy a highly speculative asset is a risk profile of its own,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.Strategy may now face removal from key benchmarks. Analysts at JPMorgan warned that the stock could be excluded from indices such as the MSCI USA and the Nasdaq 100, a shift that could unleash billions in passive outflows. The reversal is striking for a firm once viewed as a potential S&P 500 entrant.","Strategy shares slid 34% in November.

Omnicom will lay off more than 4,000 employees and merge several prominent advertising agency brands following its $13 billion acquisition of rival Interpublic Group.The job cuts will primarily affect administrative roles, with some leadership positions also impacted, reported the Financial Times on Monday, citing company executives.Omnicom CEO John Wren said. “The financial benefits would surpass the $750 million in annual cost savings initially projected to investors,” he added. Wren will remain chair and chief executive of the combined entity.The move comes as the advertising industry undergoes a major transformation, with artificial intelligence reshaping creative production and tech companies like Meta enabling businesses to produce ads faster and at scale. Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG is part of a strategy to regain momentum amid fierce competition from French ad giant Publicis and UK-based WPP.As part of the integration, creative agency DDB, founded in 1949, and marketing agency MullenLowe will be merged into Omnicom’s TBWA network. FCB, one of IPG’s largest global agency networks with roots dating back to 1873, will be absorbed into Omnicom’s BBDO, the report said.Executives noted that Omnicom’s restructuring should be seen in the context of similar changes at rivals such as WPP, which is also expected to reduce staff under new CEO Cindy Rose, according to the Financial Times.Interpublic Group had already cut about 3,200 employees in the first nine months of 2025, while Omnicom itself reduced its workforce by 3,000 last year, bringing total staff to roughly 75,000, the report added.","Omnicom will lay off more than 4,000 employees and merge several prominent advertising agency brands.

Asian markets mostly rose on Tuesday as investors focused on hopes of United States rate cuts and nerves around rising Japanese bond yields eased slightly.In Hong Kong, HSI rose 0.11%, rising 28 points to reach 26,061. Nikkei also rose 56 points to trade at 49,360 at 10:30 AM IST.South Korea's Kospi added 1.81% to 3,991.Meanwhile in China, Shanghai and Shenzhen were down 0.55% and 0.77%, respectively.The latest lift in stocks followed a muted trading session on Monday, but sentiments turned after another batch of weak US economic numbers strengthened confidence that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to cutting interest rates. Hopes of rate relief have repeatedly buoyed equities over recent weeks, helping markets erase the slump triggered earlier in November by jitters over a possible tech bubble.Expectations of a third straight cut gained further traction after multiple Fed officials indicated that preserving employment now takes priority over pushing down elevated prices. Recent figures have offered support for that shift in stance, with the broader economy, particularly the labour market, showing signs of softening while inflation appears largely stable for the moment.A fresh survey from the Institute for Supply Management revealed that US factory activity contracted for a ninth month in a row, reinforcing that narrative.With the macro signals favouring risk assets again, Asia entered Tuesday on firmer footing. Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all traded higher. Shanghai bucked the trend with a dip. Tokyo also managed to climb after suffering heavy losses the previous day, when Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda unsettled global markets by hinting at the possibility of an interest rate increase this month.Ueda’s remarks sent the yen sharply higher and pushed yields on Japanese two-year government bonds beyond the one percent mark, a level not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis. Although the Japanese currency steadied on Tuesday, the effects of the shock lingered. The comments contributed to a pullback on Wall Street following last week’s Thanksgiving rally and reduced appetite for risk, dragging the cryptocurrency market lower as well.Markets are now keeping a close watch on a scheduled auction of 10-year Japanese government bonds later on Tuesday, seen as a key test of sentiment following the recent spike in yields.Meanwhile in corporate news, one of the biggest moves in the region came from Seoul. Shares of Samsung Electronics jumped more than two percent after the tech heavyweight unveiled its first triple-folding smartphone. The company acknowledged that its price, more than $2,400, is likely to put the device beyond the reach of most consumers, but investors appeared enthusiastic nonetheless.","Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all traded higher.

In the predatory world of American artificial intelligence, where top engineers command salaries in the millions and signing bonuses rival small fortunes, Apple Inc has taken a big bite out of Microsoft and Google The iPhone giant on Monday announced the hiring of Amar Subramanya, a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft, as its new vice president of artificial intelligence, in an effort to catch up with rivals who have sped ahead. Subramanya steps into a role vacated by the retiring John Giannandrea, inheriting oversight of Apple's foundation models, machine learning research, and AI safety teams amid a high-stakes push to salvage its lagging AI ambitions.Subramanya's whirlwind journey—from Alphabet's Mountain View labs, where he helmed engineering for the Gemini AI assistant, to Microsoft's Redmond headquarters for a five-month co-piloting stint as corporate vice president of AI, and now to sickly Siri at Apple's Cupertino campus—epitomizes the escalating talent war gripping Silicon Valley and beyond.With Microsoft poaching over 20 researchers from Google's DeepMind unit earlier this year, including Subramanya in July, and now Apple counter-recruiting from its rivals, the US AI ecosystem has become a revolving door of elite minds, many of them immigrants like Subramanya.The migration isn't just about prestige; it's a battle for the intellectual capital needed to build the next generation of intelligent machines, as companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic lure defectors with million dollar windfalls, even as MAGA myopics mope about “slave labor” and “code coolies” from India and wallow in toxic gibes on X.At 46, Subramanya arrives with impeccable credentials tailored to Apple's pain points. After earning a BE in electrical, electronics, and communications engineering from Bangalore University in 2001, he completed his PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle in 2009 with a dissertation on semi-supervised learning and graphical models, innovative techniques for training AI systems with limited labeled data — now a boon for privacy-obsessed Apple, which shuns vast user-data troves in favor of synthetic and licensed datasets.Subramanya's graduate work also extended to practical applications in speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and human activity analysis. As a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research, he tackled multi-sensory fusion for robust speech systems and speaker verification, earning a prestigious Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship in 2007. This early exposure to Big Tech's labs foreshadowed his career, blending theory with deployment. His scholarly output includes the influential book Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning (co-authored with Partha Pratim Talukdar), a staple in machine learning curricula. His academic papers span entity resolution, multilingual Natural Language Processing, cross-document coreference, and audio-visual speech enhancement, underscoring his focus on scalable, multimodal systems.These foundations propelled Subramanya's 16-year Google tenure, starting around 2009 in research roles that evolved into engineering leadership. By 2023, he was head of engineering for Gemini, Google's multimodal powerhouse boasting up to 1.2 trillion parameters. Under his watch, teams of over 100 bridged experimental prototypes to production, integrating text, image, and video processing into Search, YouTube, and Android.Subramanya's pivot to Microsoft in July 2025 – along with a score of gearheads including engineering lead Sonal Gupta – was a cultural reset.

"Starbucks settlement: Coffee chain to pay $35 mn to 15,000 NYC workers; Mamdani and others join striking baristas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-settlement-coffee-chain-to-pay-35-mn-to-15000-nyc-workers-mamdani-and-others-join-striking-baristas/articleshow/125708715.cms,"Starbucks, one of the world’s biggest coffee chains, has finally agreed to hand over about $35 million to more than 15,000 New York City workers after claims that shifts were slashed without warning and schedules kept in constant flux. The announcement landed on Monday, just hours before Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US Senator Bernie Sanders walked onto a Brooklyn picket line to visit protesting baristas.The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide. Workers argued that their demands are simple: better staffing and more stable hours. But frustration only grew as almost four years passed since baristas at a Buffalo branch first came together to strike against the organisation, and a contract has still not materialised. Since then, unionisation has spread to around 550 of Starbucks’ 10,000 company-owned outlets. A further 7,000 stores operate under licence in airports, supermarkets and other venues.Both the company and union workers dispute the scale of the strike’s impact. Even so, Mamdani, Sanders and a group of state and city officials added political firepower to the movement on Monday, joining scores of baristas and supporters outside a Brooklyn Starbucks.“These are not demands of greed — these are demands of decency,” Mamdani said. Some workers held oversized cut-outs of Starbucks takeaway cups, swapping the company’s branding with the union’s. Sanders said, “Starbucks has refused to sit down and negotiate a fair contract.”Strikers described a workplace buckling under pressure, understaffed shifts, unpredictable scheduling and online orders so complex that the list of ingredients sometimes stretches beyond the height of the cup. “It is the company's issue to give us the labor amount to schedule partners fairly, and they are not scheduling us fairly, no matter how much money we are making them,” said Gabriel Pierre, 26, a shift supervisor at a suburban Bellmore shop.Meanwhile, the Seattle-based chain has been trying to regain its financial footing. Cost-conscious customers have been pressing pause on premium coffees, questioning whether they still justify the price. Starbucks recently recorded its first rise in same-store sales in nearly two years, but restructuring costs, store redesigns and other changes dragged on profits in the July–September quarter.The settlement announced by New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection further requires Starbucks to pay $3.4 million in civil penalties in addition to the $35 million earmarked for workers. Additionally, the company agreed to follow the city’s Fair Workweek law from here on.Starbucks said that it is committed to responsible operations and compliance with local laws, while acknowledging the difficulty of the rules in question. “This is notoriously challenging to manage,"" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said.Most hourly employees affected will receive $50 for each week worked between July 2021 and July 2024, the department confirmed. Staff who experienced violations after that window can still seek compensation by filing a complaint.The deal also guarantees reinstatement opportunities for employees laid off during recent store closures in the city.For many baristas, the fight continues. “I sure hope that it gives Starbucks an awakening,” said Kaari Harsila, 21, a shift supervisor from Brooklyn who joined the picket line.",The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

US Aviation Explodes: 1400+ Flights GROUNDED, Americans TRAPPED At Airports Amid Shutdown Crisis





Air travel across the United States could soon “slow to a trickle”, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Sunday, as the prolonged government shutdown continues to paralyse operations and disrupt flight schedules nationwide, AFP reported.Thousands of flights were cancelled or delayed through the weekend as the Trump administration ordered capacity cuts at 40 airports to ease pressure on air traffic controllers, many of whom have been working without pay since federal funding lapsed on October 1.“Air travel is going to slow to a trickle as everyone wants to travel to see their families,” Duffy told Fox News Sunday, cautioning that the impact will worsen as the Thanksgiving holiday season approaches.The shutdown — now stretching into its sixth week — has forced federal agencies to a near standstill, with many government employees, including airport security and traffic control staff, either furloughed or working unpaid while the political standoff between Republicans and Democrats drags on.“We’re going to see very few air traffic controllers coming to work, which means only a handful of flights will take off and land,” Duffy said.“You’re going to have massive disruption and a lot of angry Americans.”Appearing later on CNN’s “State of the Union”, Duffy warned that the situation could deteriorate further if the budget impasse is not resolved soon.“It’s only going to get worse,” he said. “Many people are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights if this thing doesn’t open back up.”The continued shutdown has raised concerns among airlines and unions about passenger safety, scheduling bottlenecks, and economic losses, with analysts estimating billions of dollars in lost productivity across the aviation and tourism sectors.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said it is prioritising essential services, but widespread absenteeism among staff has already led to longer wait times, route delays, and reduced capacity.","Air travel across the United States could soon ‘slow to a trickle’, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Sunday.

Gold price prediction:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold prices are likely to be influenced by global economic developments this week, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Here is his outlook for gold prices in the coming days:Gold hovered near the key $4,000 mark through last week, weighed by a firm US dollar and diminishing expectations of further Fed rate cuts after Chair Powell struck a cautious tone despite a second 25 bps reduction this year.Market odds for another cut in December eased from around 90% to 70%, pressuring bullion, while the dollar index held firm near 100 and USDINR inched toward 89. The record-long US government shutdown continued to disrupt key data releases, leaving investors reliant on private surveys that painted a weaker picture — both ISM manufacturing and services PMIs slipped below 50, signaling contraction.Private payrolls surprised to the upside, rising 42,000, fueling uncertainty over the Fed’s next steps. Trade sentiment improved modestly as Presidents Trump and Xi agreed on tariff reductions tied to fentanyl curbs and renewed commodity trade, trimming safe-haven demand.In China, the removal of VAT offsets for gold retailers and cuts in exemptions from 13% to 6% led major banks to freeze new retail accounts, threatening to cool demand in the world’s top gold market. Meanwhile, Fed’s liquidity support of $29.4B underscored ongoing funding stress.The US also added uranium, copper, and silver to its critical minerals list, providing structural support for precious and industrial metals. Despite softer physical demand in India and China, gold and silver gained modestly on global growth concerns, weak US sentiment, and expectations of further policy easing amid the prolonged shutdown and cooling labor market.The US Senate is now all set to advance the bill aiming at reopening the federal government and ending the 40 day shutdown that sidelined federal workers and delayed food and air travels as well. This bill would fund the government through January 2026.After the bill's advancement, economic data and surveys from the last 40 days will be released giving the market some clarity on the health of the economy. Similarly, comments from US and China trade talks will also be a key driver this week.","Gold hovered near the key $4,000 mark through last week, weighed by a firm US dollar.

Lenskart IPO



Buy or hold — What analysts say?



About Lenskart



(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India.)





Lenskart Solutions entered the Dalal Street on Monday, making a muted debut. After listing, the eyewear giant will be available for trading on both benchmark indices, NSE and BSE.The Lenskart Solutions share listed at Rs 390 on the BSE, offering a discount of 3% on its IPO price, after closing one of the year’s most keenly watched public issues.The stock was trading at Rs 390 or down 2.8% on the NSE and at Rs 389, or down 3% on the BSE at 10:07 AM IST.The share made its debut at Rs 390 on the BSE, while it opened slightly higher at Rs 395 on the NSE.Pre-listing sentiment around Lenskart Solutions cooled, as the grey market premium shrank to 2%.The eyewear retailer’s Rs 7,278 crore IPO saw overwhelming investor participation, but excitement appeared to have cooled in the run-up to its listing. In early morning indications, the grey market premium (GMP) slipped to roughly 2%, suggesting that the stock may list only slightly above its issue price.The IPO, priced between Rs 382 and Rs 402 per share, was subscribed 28 times overall. Investors bid for 281.88 crore shares against the 9.97 crore shares on offer, according to data from the exchanges.The Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) segment led the demand, with subscription at 40.35 times, while the non-institutional investors (NIIs) category saw bids 18.23 times the allocation. Retail participation was also strong, despite the higher price range.The offer consisted of fresh issue of shares worth Rs 2,150.74 crore and an offer for sale totalling Rs 5,128.02 crore. The lot size was fixed at 37 shares. Post-issue, Lenskart’s total share count increased from 1,68,10,15,590 shares to 1,73,45,16,686 shares.Despite the strong subscription numbers, analysts have expressed concerns over valuations. Earlier this week, Ambit Capital initiated coverage on Lenskart with a “Sell” rating and a target price of Rs 337, signalling a potential 16% downside from the issue price. The brokerage, as cited by ET, noted that although the company’s topline could grow around 20% CAGR between FY25 and FY28, the “capex-heavy model, thin free cash flows, and low returns on capital (RoCE of ~9%) make its valuation difficult to justify. ”SBI Securities also urged caution saying, “Valuation of Lenskart seems stretched and hence listing gain is likely to be muted. However, looking at the robust business model, the company is well placed to encash on the fast-growing domestic organized eyeglasses market.”Meanwhile, Nirmal Bang hailed Lenskart’s “resilient business model,” highlighting that it is supported by its centralised manufacturing and rising international presence.“Lenskart enjoys strong competitiveness in the Indian eyewear market by leveraging innovation, technology, and an omnichannel strategy that keeps it cost-efficient in a fragmented industry,” the brokerage noted.At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at 10.1 times FY25 EV/Sales and 68.7 times EV/EBITDA. However, profitability trends have been improving as the company’s EBITDA margin rose from 7% in FY23 to 14.7% in FY25.The company operates over 2,700 stores globally, including 2,000 in India, and has scaled its footprint across Singapore, the UAE and the United States. Over the past two years, revenue rose at a 32% CAGR to reach Rs 6,653 crore in FY25. EBITDA increased 3.7 times to Rs 971 crore during the same period, and the company posted a profit of Rs 297 crore in FY25, a sharp turnaround from a loss of Rs 64 crore two years ago.","Lenskart Solutions made its debut at Rs 390 on the BSE, while it opened slightly higher at Rs 395 on the NSE.

Who is eligible?



When will the payment be made?



What will be the structure of the dividends?



Trump’s ‘tariff dividend’







US President Donald Trump has again put his tariff-linked cash payout on the table, saying that Americans would receive money directly sourced from tariff revenues.Posting on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Trump announced a dividend of $2000 per person. He also criticised those opposing the plan, calling them “FOOLS!”Trump argued that tariff collections are becoming large enough to support such a payout, as well as broader national goals. In the post, he claimed, “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place.”After the announcement, people are left wondering about the eligibility, structure and the time of the payout.Though the details have not been revealed as of now, the US President’s post on Truth Social and his past statements hint that the payout might be only for middle income and lower income people and not for those who have higher incomes.His post read, “A dividend of at $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”Trump has suggested the dividend payout back in August too.“There could be a distribution or a dividend to the people of our country, I would say for people that would be middle income people and lower income people, we could do a dividend,"" he said, as cited by Reuters.The US President has not provided a date for the rollout. He has only said that the money would come from tariff revenue that the country is collecting.The mechanism is still being worked out, but US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said it could be delivered through tax changes.""Could the 2 thousand dollars dividend could come in lots of forms in lots of ways.""He added that it could come as tax decreases, “that we are seeing on the president's agenda”The treasury secretary further added that the structure could include no tax on tips, no tax on over time, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.“So you those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,” he said.Although Trump is promoting the “tariff dividend” as a direct benefit to households, the proposal would still require congressional approval.Earlier this year, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation seeking $600 tariff rebates for most Americans and dependent children, signalling that Republicans have been exploring tariff-funded payments as a political idea for some time.The push comes as tariffs face scrutiny in court. The Supreme Court heard arguments recently on whether the tariffs imposed earlier were lawful, with justices questioning whether they served as an emergency tool or functioned more like a tax. However, no decision has been issued yet.","US President Donald Trump has again put his tariff-linked cash payout on the table.

Markets watch: Asian stocks rise as US shutdown nears end; oil prices stay under pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/markets-watch-asian-stocks-rise-as-us-shutdown-nears-end-oil-prices-stay-under-pressure/articleshow/125238844.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





Asian stocks continued to climb for a second straight day on Tuesday as signs emerged that US lawmakers were close to resolving the country’s record-long government shutdown.The positive sentiment also lifted global markets, though oil prices remained subdued amid concerns about oversupply and slowing demand.At 0230 GMT, the Nikkei was up 0.4% at 51,131.28, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged 0.1% higher to 26,680.73, while Shanghai slipped 0.3% to 4,008.61.In Washington, senators on Monday night passed a compromise budget deal after several Democrats sided with Republicans to fund government departments through January.If the measure clears the House of Representatives, the government could reopen by Friday. “It appears to us this morning that our long national nightmare is finally coming to an end,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said, while President Donald Trump told reporters that the deal was “very good” and that the country would be “opening up very quickly.”According to Reuters, the progress in Washington boosted risk appetite across markets, with Japan, South Korea, and Australia opening higher.The S&P 500 jumped 1.5% on Monday and the Nasdaq 100 gained 2.2%, while the MSCI All Country World Index recorded its best session since June.Commodities, cryptocurrencies, and industrial metals such as aluminium and copper also saw gains.The dollar weakened, while gold and Bitcoin rallied.Analysts said the reopening would help restore the flow of key US data on jobs and inflation, which could guide the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate decision. “Reopening would not only boost sentiment but also open the way for data releases,” said Fiona Cincotta of City Index, as quoted by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, oil prices were weighed down by rising production and sanctions-related disruptions.Brent crude slipped 0.4% to $63.83 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate dropped to $59.90, according to AFP.As per Reuters, while optimism over the US budget deal supported broader market sentiment, “worries about crude oversupply” limited oil’s recovery.Analysts at energy consultancy Ritterbusch and Associates noted that as OPEC production continues to rise, “global oil balances are acquiring an increasingly bearish hue” due to weaker demand and slower growth in major consuming nations.Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to increase December output targets by 137,000 barrels per day, the same pace as in previous months, but will pause hikes in the first quarter of next year.Adding to oil market jitters, new US sanctions on Russian firms Rosneft and Lukoil had begun to bite. Lukoil reportedly declared force majeure at its Iraqi oil field, and Bulgaria prepared to seize its Burgas refinery. The sanctions have also caused a surge in crude stored in Asian waters as exports to China and India fell.Some refiners in both countries have turned to Middle Eastern suppliers instead.Ritterbusch analysts added that a key uncertainty for oil’s outlook “is the extent to which China will continue to push Russian supplies into strategic stockpiles and whether India will succumb to Trump’s suggestions to defer further purchases from Russia.","Nikkei was up 0.4% at 51,131.28, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged 0.1% higher to 26,680.73, while Shanghai slipped 0.3% to 4,008.61.

Citigroup downgraded Trent to sell with the target price drastically cut to Rs 4,350 from Rs 7,150. Analysts said with the overall consumption trend remaining weak bundled with increasing competition, impact of cannibalisation and new store expansion, they expect Trent’s growth rate to moderate further. They cut the company revenue estimates, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBIDTA) for FY26-FY28.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Nykaa with the target price at Rs 271. Analysts said that in the July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26) the company’s beauty business maintained its momentum, while fashion business's gross merchandise value (GMV) growth improved significantly. Its fashion business’s EBITDA loss narrowed, led by operating leverage on marketing spends. The company’s management was confident of maintaining the growth momentum across both businesses. Analysts said the performance of the company’s beauty business should be strong in Q3FY26, aided by Nykaaland and sales.Goldman Sachs has a neutral rating on Divis Laboratories with the target price at Rs 6,765. Analysts said its Q2FY26 revenue and EBITDA grew by 16% and 24% year-on-year (YoY), above the brokerage’s estimates, primarily driven by custom synthesis, while generics also came back to growth.Its EBITDA margin came in at 32.7% mainly on account of better product mix, higher operating leverage as well as some forex gains. The company also reiterated its double-digit growth outlook.Jefferies has a buy rating on Torrent Pharma with the target price at Rs 4,300. Analysts said that in Q2FY26, the company beat estimates, driven mainly by stronger US and Brazil sales. India continued its market beating growth which was in-line with estimates, while continued supply disruptions caused a decline in growth in business from Germany. Analysts expect India and Brazil to continue to out-perform, with an increase in ANDA filing to lead the path of sustained US growth with Germany back to normal by the March quarter.Nuvama has a hold rating on Bajaj Auto with the target price at Rs 9,700, slightly cut from Rs 9,800 earlier. Analysts said Bajaj Auto’s Q2FY26 revenue and EBITDA rose 14% and 15% YoY, in line with estimates. They forecast a 7% compounded annual growth in volume over FY25–FY28. While domestic growth is expected to rise at 2%, exports are expected to rise to 13%. They also expect Bajaj Auto’s domestic two-wheeler market share to dip from 12% in FY25 to 10% in FY28. However, the company’s exports are expected to drive growth, led by Latin America and Asia demand.","Citigroup downgraded Trent to sell with the target price drastically cut to Rs 4,350 from Rs 7,150.

NEW DELHI: Goldman Sachs on Monday raised Indian equities to “overweight” and set a target of Nifty hitting 29,000 by 2026-end, driven by improving financial conditions and growth supportive policies by the govt and RBI.“With a year-long earnings downgrade cycle stabilising in the past few months and showing signs of recovery, coupled with our expectations of policy-driven easing financial conditions going forward, we now see a case for Indian equities to perform better over the coming year and moderate its significant underperformance versus the region,” Goldman Sachs said in a report.The report said year-long earnings downgrade cycle, which was a primary reason for lowering the Indian equity market view last year, has bottomed out and will see recovery heading into next year. Goldman Sachs also said that a series of regulatory easing measures announced this year should aid growth recovery over next two years.It cited the RBI rate cuts of 100 basis points in 2025 had improved liquidity conditions and given typical transmission lags and expectations that these measures will ease financials.The report said that on the fiscal front, the government’s targeted consolidation over the next two years is less pronounced than in the past few years, suggesting peak fiscal drag was largely over.“This along with personal income tax cuts and the recent GST rate cuts, should boost mass consumption recovery, that was already underway before the GST simplification.“On the investment front, while elevated trade uncertainty has dampened corporate capex ordering activity this year, we expect US-India tariffs to ultimately settle at lower levels, which should foster a recovery,” said the report. It said that foreigners have net sold $30 billion over the past year, second largest historically, pushing foreign ownership and mutual fund allocations near two-decade lows.The report said recent reversals suggest improving foreign risk appetite and flows as earnings recover. Potential moderation in US trade tensions could act as an additional market catalyst.","Goldman Sachs on Monday raised Indian equities to “overweight’ and set a target of Nifty hitting 29,000 by 2026-end.

India’s pharma industry has so far focused largely on generics. What would be the focus for Torrent?





NEW DELHI: Torrent Pharma, flagship of the Ahmedabad based Torrent Group, plans to drive growth by focusing on innovation to address “unmet needs in chronic therapies” and by expanding into highgrowth segments. The company, which holds market leadership in the vitamins category with its Rs 500-crore brand Shelcal (plus variants), and has cardiac drug Nikoran with sales of Rs 245-crore in its portfolio, will continue to build on these core strengths to sustain its growth trajectory, while foraying into newer segments, including the weightloss therapies.Besides India, Brazil is tipped to become its biggest market, even as the company is open to explore manufacturing opportunities in the US if it offers “long-term strategic value”, Aman Mehta, managing director of the over Rs 11,500-crore company, toldThere are four large-scale ones and other small brand deals and assets that we’ve acquired. In the last five years, JB Chem is the second-largest acquisition, and the largest in absolute value. The acquisition (spree) started with Elder Pharma in 2014, then Unichem in 2017, then Curatio in 2022 and JB in 2025. We have recently received the CCI and Sebi approval, subject to voluntary modifications.The JB team has been doing a great job, having built the company over the last five years, adding a lot of high-growth areas.Further, the CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) business has done quite well. It’s a very attractive segment with a long-term potential — it’ll take us some time to understand the space because we don’t operate in it. So reinvesting, adding more customers, new products, that’s something we would focus on.It’ll all be debt financed. The fund-raise will be undertaken through global banks, with the quantum ranging over Rs 12,000 crore. For acquiring 46.4% KKR stake, the outgo will be around 12,000 crore. And for the open offer, additional funds may be required, depending on subscription.I think the first and foremost priority right now will be to integrate JB into and with our organisation. That process generally takes one to two years. Within that period, it’s not advisable to take any additional large bets. An acquisition-led approach will continue to remain a priority for us, especially in Indian market. So if an opportunity does materialise in the near future, we would certainly be keen to pursue it.I think the situation is still evolving. We only have a marketing front-end in the US right now. We haven’t made any decisions yet, but if there’s strategic value in US manufacturing, we’ll consider it. Also, there are segments within manufacturing which are not necessarily prone to the usual pricing pressure. And complex products for example, which have relatively low competition. So there are segments where one can look at having a base in the US.The US accounts for about 10-11% of our revenue, around $150 million, growing at 25% this year. We do aim for a larger share in the US market, but these investments take time. Besides India, Brazil and Germany are significant markets, with Brazil potentially surpassing the US soon because it’s on a very steady growth path. Brazil was chosen to be one of the key areas of expansion back in the late ’90s because of our first-mover advantage, we are leveraging it today.Our inherent strength has been in the chronic disease segment, and there is still a fairly large unmet need in chronic diseases, especially in the Indian population. I think the ability to invest today in innovation is much higher than it was before, and as people see more successes, more people will get drawn to taking risks. Over the next five to 10 years, we will see a lot more innovation coming from India than we’ve ever seen. For Torrent, the future pipeline will remain first-to-market launches in our key markets — India and Brazil. About 70% of these would be in the chronic domain.","Torrent Pharma, flagship of the Ahmedabad based Torrent Group, plans to drive growth by focusing on innovation.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman kicked off pre-budget consultations with economists and agriculture sector experts, amid suggestions that the overall economic situation was looking healthy.“Overall, economists were positive about growth, inflation and the fiscal situation and how govt was sticking to the fiscal glide path. The reduction in income tax and GST burden, along with the reforms, are seen as positive,” said a source present in the meeting of FM with economists.Overall economic growth is expected to be in line with Centre’s projection of 6.26.8% during the current fiscal year, with inflation moderating to an eight-year low of 1.5%. Economists and govt are of the view that the reduction in taxes will boost consumption and help step up private investment.Some of those present during the consultations suggested to Sitharaman that there was a need to push manufacturing as it will help create jobs and boost small businesses, which can then cater to the requirements of large businesses looking to source goods. There were also suggestions to incentivise small businesses, including street vendors, and steps to help improve the use of available land.During the meeting with farm sector experts, a stronger policy support was demanded. Bharat Krishak Samaj chairman Ajay Vir Jakhar said the fund allocation for research and development in agriculture has reduced in real terms over the last two decades and emphasised the need to double the funding.He also called for a review of the crop insurance scheme, as most farmers and states were dissatisfied with outcomes. “Consider substituting it with a crop compensation scheme/fund,” a news agency quoted him as saying.",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman kicked off pre-budget consultations with economists and agriculture sector experts.

US President Donald Trump on Monday, once again claimed that India has stopped Russian oil imports and added that they are going to ""bring down the tariffs"" imposed on New Delhi.When asked about how close a trade deal with India is and whether he is willing to consider lowering the current tariff rate, Trump said, ""Well, right now, the tariffs are very high on India because of the Russian oil, and they've stopped doing the Russian oil. It's been reduced very substantially.

He noted that both investors and the Fed have been “flying blind since the beginning of October, with a near-complete absence of data.”Morrison added, “Fed Chair Jerome Powell has played down the prospect of another rate cut in December, as it is far from obvious that inflation has peaked.”Investor focus on Monday was dominated by the prospect of a government reopening, as concerns mounted over the impact on low-income households reliant on food benefits and potential disruptions to air travel ahead of Thanksgiving.“Shutdowns haven't typically had a big bearing on the economy or on financial markets.

US-China trade tensions: Beijing rolls back 'special port fees' on US vessels for one year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-trade-tensions-beijing-rolls-back-special-port-fees-on-us-vessels-for-one-year/articleshow/125220765.cms,"‘FOOLS’: Trump Promises To Pay $2,000 Tariff Cheque To Americans, Sends Shockwaves In US





The United States and China have begun rolling back trade actions, after the Busan meeting ended with “a great success.”Beijing recently suspended the export ban on ‘dual use’ materials while US reduced the fentanyl related duties from 20% to 10%.China also suspended the ‘special port fees’ on US vessels.The transport ministry announced that from 13:01 (05:01 GMT) on Monday, “special port fees” will no longer apply to ships that are either operated by or constructed in the United States when they call at Chinese ports. The decision will remain in place for one year and comes “simultaneously” with Washington’s decision to pause its own port charges on Chinese-built and operated vessels.This marks another step in the gradual rollback of tariff actions that escalated over several months, during which duties reached triple-digit levels. Those penalties stalled trade between the world’s two biggest economies and disrupted global supply routes. The current easing follows a meeting between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in South Korea last month, where both sides agreed to retract some punitive measures.The rivalry over commercial influence has also brought attention to global shipbuilding trends. The United States, once dominant in the years following the Second World War, now produces only 0.1% of the world’s commercial ships.Asian shipyards lead the industry, with China constructing nearly half of the vessels launched globally, followed by South Korea and Japan.In a parallel development, Beijing confirmed the suspension of sanctions placed on several US subsidiaries of Hanwha Ocean, one of South Korea’s largest shipbuilders. The one-year suspension, effective from 10 November, corresponds with the US decision to halt port fees on ships connected to China, according to a separate statement released by China’s commerce ministry.“In light of this (US suspension)... China has decided to suspend the relevant measures” for one year, the ministry said, as cited by AFP.China introduced those sanctions in October, accusing the subsidiaries of supporting a US government “Section 301” investigation that labelled China’s dominance in the shipbuilding sector as unreasonable. The sanctions prohibited organisations and individuals in China from working with Hanwha Shipping LLC, Hanwha Philly Shipyard Inc., Hanwha Ocean USA International LLC, Hanwha Shipping Holdings LLC and HS USA Holdings Corp.A planned investigation into whether that Section 301 probe affected the “security and development interests” of China’s shipbuilding industry and supply chain has also been halted for one year, according to the transport ministry.These latest suspensions form part of a wider sequence of reciprocal steps taken after the Xi–Trump discussions. On Wednesday, Beijing said it would extend the one-year suspension of additional tariffs on US goods, keeping them at 10%, while also dropping some tariffs on soybeans and other agricultural imports from the United States.In the past week, China has also stopped enforcing an export ban on gallium, germanium and antimony, metals considered crucial for modern technologies. It additionally paused a one-year restriction on rare earths technology exports.The Chinese commerce ministry said Washington, for its part, agreed to suspend its export restrictions on affiliates of blacklisted foreign companies where those entities hold a stake of at least 50%.","Beijing recently suspended the export ban on ‘dual use’ materials while US reduced the fentanyl related duties from 20% to 10%.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders

H-1B visa fee hike: How US is asking for evidence

H-1B visa noose tightens





The Donald Trump administration is tightening its noose, cracking down and seeking evidence of the $100,000 H-1B visa fee. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has started sending requests for evidence seeking the $100,000 H-1B fee, amidst increased immigration oversight in the region.This action follows the executive order issued in September that established a $100,000 fee requirement for new H-1B applications submitted by candidates outside the United States and those needing consular processing after September 21.When immigration officials determine insufficient documentation exists to approve an application, the USCIS issues a request for evidence.Several immigration specialists informed ET that requests for evidence are appearing in cases where the fee requirement is not applicable, citing ambiguity regarding who must pay the $100,000 fee. This situation could lead to additional legal challenges. This change predominantly affects Indians, who represent 70% of H-1B visa recipients.Gnanamookan Senthurjothi, who established The Visa Code, noted that requests for evidence demanding the $100,000 fee are being sent for H-1B ""recapture time"" applications.The H-1B recapture time provision enables individuals to recover unused portions of their six-year limit in the United States by requesting the USCIS to include time spent outside the country for durations exceeding 24 hours.Request for Evidence (RFEs) continue to be distributed whilst ambiguity persists regarding the proclamation, notwithstanding USCIS's explanatory notes.At the Murthy Law Firm in Maryland, managing attorney Adam Rosen identified a fundamental concern within the proclamation's text. ""The proclamation used the term 'visa' interchangeably with 'status' despite both holding separate meanings independent of one another,"" he said.Additionally, Rosen addressed the validity of the fee requirement. Though section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorises presidential control over entry conditions, the proclamation requires payment from the petitioner rather than the entering beneficiary.Legal experts suggest a dual response strategy for RFE recipients. Initially, submit a response demonstrating fee exemption based on USCIS's restricted interpretation of the proclamation. Subsequently, if denied due to non-payment, Rosen advises that the decision ""can be challenged in federal court"", considering this the ""optimal solution"".Various legal actions have been initiated in US courts, including submissions from the US Chamber of Commerce and H-1B representatives, contesting the fee implementation.Boundless Immigration's CEO, Xiao Wang, suggests these applications were likely processed between initial qualification and USCIS's October 20 formal guidance. ""While this has created some confusion for employers who thought they understood the rules, right now it shouldn't be taken as an indication that the administration intends to expand the definition of who must pay the $100k filing fee,"" he said.Legal action, though available, remains challenging for many individuals. According to Kate Kalmykov, who co-chairs the immigration and compliance practice at Florida-based Greenberg Traurig law firm, ""Filing a lawsuit is generally a measure of last resort. Litigation can be both time-consuming and costly.""The mounting expenses and unpredictable outcomes are influencing how organisations approach recruitment, as noted by Kalmykov. ""At this time, some companies may choose to reassess their sponsorship strategies: either pausing new H-1B filings for overseas talent or relocating employees abroad to avoid the significant additional costs now associated with H-1B sponsorship under consular processing,"" she said.Wang highlighted a notable transition towards independent immigration planning. ""The H-1B's volatility is driving both individuals and employers to explore pathways that don't depend on lottery systems or sudden policy changes. Companies are also investing more in upskilling domestic workers while selectively using immigration for truly critical roles,"" he said.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services has started sending requests for evidence seeking the $100,000 H-1B fee. This action follows the executive order issued in September that established a $100k fee requirement.

"US supply chain strain: FAA flight cuts, cargo jet grounding hit US logistics; FedEx and UPS brace for holiday rush",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-supply-chain-strain-faa-flight-cuts-cargo-jet-grounding-hit-us-logistics-fedex-and-ups-brace-for-holiday-rush/articleshow/125205953.cms,"



The US air cargo industry is bracing for fresh turbulence as the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) 10% reduction in flight capacity across 40 major airports collides with the grounding of UPS and FedEx’s McDonnell Douglas MD-11 fleets, deepening pressure on supply chains ahead of the crucial Thanksgiving and holiday shipping season.The FAA ordered airlines to cut domestic flight operations by 10% between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, citing air traffic controller shortages caused by the prolonged government shutdown, AP reported. The decision affects key hubs with major parcel distribution centres — including FedEx’s Memphis and Indianapolis bases and UPS’ Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky, where a deadly cargo plane crash this week killed 14 people, including three crew members.Both companies announced they were grounding their MD-11 aircraft “out of an abundance of caution”, removing a significant chunk of capacity — roughly 9% of UPS’ fleet and 4% of FedEx’s. The double blow has prompted concerns about rising strain on logistics networks just weeks before the peak shopping period.“This is such a stressful time for both companies,” said Patrick Penfield, supply-chain management professor at Syracuse University, quoted AP.“You’ve got a surge in demand, and then you just lost some of your capacity. They’re already scrambling, and now they’re going to scramble even more.” Penfield warned that shoppers could face delivery delays of up to two days in mid-December, urging consumers to order early.While most air freight is international — and thus largely unaffected by the FAA directive — the cutback in domestic passenger flights, which carry about 35% of global trade by value, is expected to cause short-term constraints.FedEx said it had made “operational modifications” to keep shipments moving “safely and swiftly,” while UPS assured customers that its network remains “safe, resilient and reliable.” Both carriers said most of their flights operate outside the restricted hours, reducing immediate impact on overnight deliveries.Still, industry leaders warned of ripple effects. Mike Short, president of global freight forwarder C.H. Robinson, said the reduction in commercial flights could tighten domestic air capacity and extend transit times. “Trucks and expedited ground networks can absorb some displaced volume, but not without challenges,” he said.Smaller high-value goods such as smartphones, chips and consoles rely heavily on air transport, and experts say those shipments may face mild disruption. However, ground transport networks are expected to offset part of the capacity loss for domestic parcels.“Air cargo depends on every part of the aviation ecosystem working in sync,” said Brandon Fried, executive director of the Airforwarders Association. “When capacity is cut and federal employees are stretched thin, the supply chain slows — and the longer this shutdown continues, the worse it will get.”Despite the turbulence, logistics experts say the sector has become more resilient and adaptive after years of pandemic-related shocks. “Airlines have become very good at consolidating loads and rerouting via secondary hubs,” said Eytan Buchman, chief marketing officer of Freightos. “In the near term, space may feel tighter, but this isn’t a one-to-one loss in capacity.”For now, industry watchers expect limited delays — but warn that if the shutdown drags into December, America’s holiday deliveries could face their biggest stress test in years.","FAA ordered airlines to cut domestic flight operations by 10% between 6 a.m and 10 p.m. local time, citing air traffic controller shortages caused by the prolonged government shutdown.

China has granted exemptions to export controls on Nexperia chips for civilian applications, its commerce ministry said on Sunday, signalling a potential easing of pressure on the global auto industry hit by supply shortages following earlier curbs, Reuters reported.The announcement marks Beijing’s strongest indication yet that it will relax restrictions imposed after the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, a key supplier of basic chips used in automotive electrical systems.Nexperia, based in the Netherlands but owned by China’s Wingtech Technology, had been at the centre of a trade standoff that disrupted global chip supplies. The Chinese ministry did not define what constitutes “civilian use,” but the move comes after German and Japanese companies said deliveries of Nexperia’s China-made chips had resumed.Despite the exemptions, China–Netherlands relations, and by extension ties with the European Union, are expected to remain strained until the dispute over Nexperia’s ownership and operations is resolved.The Dutch government seized control of the company on September 30, citing concerns that Wingtech’s plans to shift production to China posed a threat to European economic security.In response, China halted exports of Nexperia’s finished chips, which are primarily packaged in China, but last week said it would start accepting applications for export exemptions following a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30.China’s commerce ministry reiterated that it aims to protect global chip supply chains, while accusing the Netherlands of failing to act to resolve the standoff.In its statement Sunday, the ministry urged the European Union to “intensify efforts” to persuade the Netherlands to reverse its decision.“China welcomes the EU to continue leveraging its influence to urge the Netherlands to promptly rectify its erroneous actions,” the ministry said.","China grants exemptions to export controls on Nexperia chips for civilian applications.

'You Dispute, But...': Justice Alito Grills Dem Attorney On Trump Emergency Powers In Tariffs Case

How to get the tariff dividend? Who will get it?







President Donald Trump Sunday again promised tariff dividend to Americans which will possibly be a payout to every American straight from the money America will be raising from its tariffs. This is not the first time that Trump floated the idea but this time he specified the amount and also spelt out the condition that high-income people will not get it. “A dividend of at $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” the president said on his Truth Social platform. He added that those against the tariffs are “FOOLS!”Such a proposal would likely need to be passed by Congress. This summer, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) introduced legislation to give $600 tariff rebates to nearly all Americans and their dependent children.""We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,"" Trump posted.The doubling down on tariffs from the President came as the Supreme Court, earlier this week, heard arguments on tariffs, whether they were legally imposed.Judges were concerned that tariffs acted as a revenue-raising tax as opposed to a mechanism to solve any emergency caused by a trade imbalance. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the tariff case.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, said the tariffs were not about ""taking in the revenue,"" but rather were intended to re-balance trade.This is the first time that Trump specified the amount of $2000 as a tariff dividend. Earlier, he suggested that Americans may get an amount between $1000 and $2000 as the dividend. It is not yet clear how the administration will give it.The proposal sounds like stimulus checks, which are direct payments from the government to taxpayers during an economic slowdown to encourage taxpayers to spend money.Though most of the details are unclear, one clarity that Trump's Truth Social post offered was that high-income people would not receive it.","Trump said every American, excluding high-income people, will get $2K as tariff dividend.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the economic fallout from the prolonged government shutdown is intensifying, saying the situation is getting “worse and worse” as disruptions ripple through key sectors and strain public finances.Air traffic across the United States could “slow to a trickle” if the federal government shutdown continues into the busy Thanksgiving travel season, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Sunday, as flight cancellations and staff shortages deepen the crisis in the aviation sector, AP reported.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week ordered flight cuts at major airports after growing absenteeism among air traffic controllers, who have gone unpaid for nearly a month. The reductions, which began Friday at 4%, are set to rise to 10% by November 14, affecting all commercial airlines between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time.As of Sunday morning, 1,375 flights had been cancelled across the country, following more than 1,500 cancellations on Saturday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.Duffy said further cuts of up to 20% might be necessary if the shutdown persists and controllers miss another pay cycle.“More controllers aren’t coming to work day by day, the further they go without a paycheck,” he told Fox News Sunday.Looking ahead to the holiday season, Duffy warned of severe disruptions: “As we get closer to Thanksgiving travel, you’re going to have air travel slow to a trickle as everyone wants to travel to see their families,” he said, adding that with “very few controllers working,” only limited flights would take off and land.“You’re going to have massive disruption and a lot of angry Americans,” he said. “We have to be honest about where this is going — it doesn’t get better. It gets worse until these air traffic controllers are paid.”The US has faced an air traffic controller shortage for years, and the situation has worsened under the shutdown, with 15 to 20 controllers retiring daily, Duffy told CNN.He said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had offered to deploy military air traffic controllers, though it remains unclear whether they are qualified to operate civilian systems.Duffy rejected Democratic claims that the cancellations were politically motivated, insisting the cuts were necessary to maintain safety. “I needed to take action to keep people safe,” he said. “I’m doing what I can in a mess that Democrats have put in my lap.”","FAA last week ordered flight cuts at major airports after growing absenteeism among air traffic controllers, who have gone unpaid for nearly a month.

Pakistan’s manufacturing sector slump: Private investment plunges 46%; experts warn of long-term industrial decay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistans-manufacturing-sector-slump-private-investment-plunges-46-experts-warn-of-long-term-industrial-decay/articleshow/125199006.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden





Pakistan’s manufacturing industry, once considered a key driver of economic growth and employment, is undergoing one of its worst downturns in recent history.The sector has seen a steep 46 per cent fall in private investment over the past six years, raising fears of long-term stagnation among economists and industrial experts.According to The Express Tribune report cited by news agency ANI, private investment in manufacturing dropped from PKR 706 billion in FY2018–19 to just PKR 377 billion in FY2024–25, marking the weakest phase of industrial growth in more than a decade.Ali Imran Asif, Senior Executive Committee Member of the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), warned that the current level of investment was “not enough to even replace depreciating machinery,” suggesting a deep erosion of Pakistan’s industrial foundation.“We are not dealing with a short-term dip; we are watching our industrial base disintegrate,” Asif said, as per The Express Tribune.He stressed that without structural reforms focused on productivity, innovation, and competitiveness, the country could face prolonged industrial paralysis.The combined contribution of the manufacturing and mining sectors to Pakistan’s GDP has remained stagnant at around 13.2 per cent over the past six years.Frequent policy changes, high energy costs, and volatile currency movements have severely affected export-oriented sectors such as textiles, leather, and engineering goods.Large-scale manufacturing output fell 1.5 per cent in FY25, reversing the 0.92 per cent growth recorded in FY24.In contrast, neighbouring economies like India and Bangladesh have maintained strong industrial growth supported by stable policies and export diversification.Economist Shahid Saleem noted that Pakistan’s slump is not merely the result of high interest rates but also reflects policy inconsistency and eroding investor confidence.Import restrictions and weak domestic demand have forced many factories to run below capacity, he added.Experts, as cited by ANI, warned that unless Pakistan swiftly formulates a credible industrial revival plan and ensures policy stability, the manufacturing sector’s decline will deepen further, undermining exports, employment and broader economic resilience.","Pakistan’s manufacturing industry is undergoing one of its worst downturns in recent history.

Flying private jets is no longer just for the ultra-rich,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/flying-private-jets-is-no-longer-just-for-the-ultra-rich/articleshow/125198189.cms,"An AI-generated image

Private jet deliveries are up

Who is the typical private jet buyer?

Who is the typical private jet user?



What is a private jet exactly?

The sky-high cost(s) of owning a jet

Time is the new ultimate luxury







It is not just superstars, royal families or oligarchs skipping long security lines and sitting in the cushy leather seats anymore.Today, there are more options than ever to take to the skies in a private jet without being head of state, CEO or owning a plane outright.Since the Covid-19 pandemic travel slump, planemakers have made a steady recovery driven by strong customer demand.Currently, there are around 23,500 private jets in service globally, according to Denesz Thiyagarajan, head of the general aviation team at IBA Insight, an aviation advisory company.In 2020, there were 644 business-jet deliveries. By 2024, this jumped to 764. For this year, Thiyagarajan and his team forecast another 820 deliveries, which is a 7.3% year-on-year increase. There are waiting lists for some of the most in-demand jets.JetNet, another aviation analyst, expects nearly 9,700 new business jets to be delivered globally through 2034.Private jet buyers are typically high-net-worth individuals, governments, corporations or charter operators like NetJets or FlexJets. The market remains dominated by wholly owned aircraft, Thiyagarajan told DW, though so-called fractional ownership is increasing.Daniel Riefer, a Munich-based partner at McKinsey's travel, logistics and infrastructure practice, says from a business model perspective, fractional ownership operators have seen ""the strongest expansion over the past five years.""Besides fractional ownership, subscriptions or membership programs, which provide cardholders access to an operator's entire fleet for a certain number of flight hours, are also becoming more popular. These branded charter operators usually own and operate their fleets directly.Aircraft owned by individuals or companies are often managed by service providers, who may additionally charter them to others when not in use, Riefer, who is also a former commercial airline pilot, told DW.The profile of the average private jet user has changed and expanded since the pandemic. Today, it is no longer just the ultra-rich and corporate executives who step onboard.The market now includes ""families, entrepreneurs and first-time flyers seeking safety, flexibility, reliability and luxury that commercial airlines couldn't guarantee during the crisis,"" said Thiyagarajan.The aviation expert thinks this shift was caused by a big wealth transfer, high liquidity and changing priorities after the pandemic. At the same time, the increase in charter and membership options makes access to private jets easier.Not only are more jets being sold, they are flying more, too. Hours flown on private jets are around 115% to 120% above 2019 levels, according to Riefer, though usage varies by region and is influenced by things like the availability of commercial airlines and transport infrastructure.Private jets, also referred to as business or corporate jets, come in seven different categories based on size and range, explains Thiyagarajan.The smallest business jet is a 4-seat, single-pilot plane with a short range. After that comes mid-range jets for 6-10 passengers. Then there are longer-range jets for 10-19 passengers and finally executive airliners with room for 20 to 50 or more passengers.At the top rung of the executive airliner ladder are jets for premium long-haul travel. Boeing Business Jets recently announced a new full-service program to turn commercial Boeing 747-8s into such executive airliners.The commercial version of these Boeings holds about 600 passengers. The updated 747-8 VIP will be the largest private jet in the air and have space for around 75 passengers, according to the company.Not everyone is looking for the biggest and best. But there is more demand for larger jets ""particularly in the super-midsize and long-range categories,"" said Riefer, ""while midsize and light jets have declined as a share of the total fleet over the past decade.""For Boeing and Airbus turning their commercial jets into tailored private aircraft is a side business. Other companies focus on it like US-based Gulfstream, Honda Aircraft and Textron, Canada's Bombardier, Brazil's Embraer, France's Dassault, and Pilatus in Switzerland.List price for a brand-new private jet can cost anywhere from a few million dollars to over $75 million (€64.9 million) for a Gulfstream G700 or $78 million for a Bombardier Global 8000, and that is before any customization.The Boeing 747-8 VIP is expected to cost a few hundred million dollars. And those are just the costs of buying a jet.Actually flying it costs even more. Fixed and operating expenses like fuel, maintenance, insurance, landing, parking, crew and catering can add up to another few million a year depending on size and use.Private jets produce more emissions per passenger than commercial planes, and climate activists have targeted them because they represent elite excess and unnecessary emissions. But for most frequent flyers, it will take more than protesters to keep them off the tarmac.For manufacturers, geopolitical uncertainty and tariffs are having some impact on supply chains and their ability to churn out aircraft, which is leading to backlogs. Yet, a broader economic downturn seems far off.Denesz Thiyagarajan expects to see sustained growth in the next few years driven by rising global wealth, more corporate use and increased accessibility through charter programs and fractional ownership.Daniel Riefer agrees but points out regional differences. ""The US will remain the largest market in absolute terms, while the fastest growth is projected in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America,"" he said.""The fractional ownership model is likely to gain further share, enhancing utilization and making private aviation more accessible and flexible.""","There are around 23,500 private jets in service globally, according to IBA Insight.

Will the AI bubble burst as investors grow wary of returns?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-the-ai-bubble-burst-as-investors-grow-wary-of-returns/articleshow/125198174.cms,"Photo credit: ANI

France Backs India’s AI Vision: Anne Bouverot Lauds New Delhi’s Balance Between Innovation, Ethics

Corporations are hesitant over AI adoption

Unsustainable capital burn

Investors increasingly cautious

When will the bubble pop?





The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent.Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030.Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations.But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits.Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting.""The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer,"" Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW.""Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst.""The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August.AI’s biggest challenge remains its tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but false information. Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time.""Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances,"" said Frey.As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade.In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month.""What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI,"" economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW.Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September.Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are ""charging far less than they need to make a profit"" and should raise subscription prices.Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI despite little evidence of sustainable returns dwarfs previous speculative frenzies.""We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP, four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust,"" Garran told DW.Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability.That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses.""The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production,"" he told DW.Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion.""With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped,"" Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. ""My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense.""Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up.""They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall,"" Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is ""skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better.""Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a ""market correction"" in AI, rather than a ""cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'""After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus ""shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact.""""More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns,"" she added.","Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value.

China has stepped back from one of its toughest trade measures against the United States, pausing a ban that restricted exports of gallium, germanium, antimony and other products linked to high-tech manufacturing. The commerce ministry said on Sunday that the suspension applies to “dual-use” items, goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes and takes effect immediately.The export controls were originally introduced in December 2024. The pause will remain in place until November 27, 2026, according to the ministry’s statement cited by Reuters.The announcement follows a recent meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on 30 October in South Korea. During the talks, the two leaders agreed to soften parts of their tariff dispute and unwind several penalties imposed on each other over the past year of escalating trade measures.Throughout the tariff stand-off, both countries repeatedly raised import duties, at one point reaching triple-digit levels. The dispute disrupted global supply chains and slowed movement of goods between the world’s two largest economies.China has held a significant influence over the supply of these metals, which are essential for modern technology used in semiconductors, smartphones and advanced military systems. By restricting shipments, Beijing had sought to exploit its dominant position in the critical minerals market.Alongside the freeze on the gallium, germanium and antimony curbs, the ministry confirmed that it has also suspended tighter checks on end-users and end-use purposes for dual-use graphite exports to the United States. These checks were introduced at the same time as the metal restrictions.The move forms part of a broader rollback. On Friday, China announced it would also pause export controls imposed on October 9, which included widened restrictions on certain rare earth elements and lithium battery materials.Xi and Trump earlier agreed that, for the next year, both sides would scale back tariffs and hold off on further trade actions, a step aimed at preventing fresh escalation while negotiations continue.","China has stepped back from one of its toughest trade measures against the United States.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"
"Find less costly ways to address pension concerns instead of OPS, says Raghuram Rajan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/find-less-costly-ways-to-address-pension-concerns-instead-of-ops-says-raghuram-rajan/articleshow/98457871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme and suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.Rajan further said the old pension scheme does involve massive future outlays because of the indexation of pensions to current salaries.""This is an enormous obligation, not necessarily in the short run, but in the long run,"" he said, adding obviously, state governments have to think through the long-term implications for government finances, and whether civil servants are the most in need of help among the constituencies they deal with.Rajan, currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said as he understands it, it may be infeasible technically or legally to move back to the old pension scheme.""If so, there may be less costly ways of addressing the concerns that prompt such moves,"" Rajan told PTI in an email interview.In a major move, a select group of central government employees have been given a one-time option to opt for old pension scheme.The employees who joined the central government services against posts advertised or notified before December 22, 2003, the day National Pension System ( NPS ) was notified, are eligible to join the old pension scheme under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021).Under Old Pension Scheme (OPS), employees get a defined pension. An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

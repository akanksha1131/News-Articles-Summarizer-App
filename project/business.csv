Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for March 13, 2025:Nifty recovered nearly 150 points from its intraday lows of Wednesday which was purely due to a weaker global handover to end flat.

Any price action allowing the index to sustain below 47800 could further trigger a bearish cup and handle breakdown on charts of Bank Nifty. Negation for the same stands at 48100 while a short covering move does not trigger unless a close above 49000 is not seen on the index.DLF has completed a 35% correction from its highs, a similar percentage of cooldown was seen in 2021-2022 correction in this REALTY bull market started since Covid lows. A reversal has been confirmed on weekly charts with an initial spike of 6-8% on the upside.SRF has registered its highest ever weekly closing as chemicals have started showing signs of ending its multiyear consolidation.

Golden Visa Benefits:

In today's uncertain and dynamic global environment, affluent individuals seek alternative arrangements for themselves and their loved ones - arrangements that provide secure havens during turbulent times whilst enabling enhanced access to worldwide commercial and lifestyle prospects.

Golden visas serve as strategic tools for affluent individuals seeking to safeguard their wealth and enhance their global mobility. These programmes are said to offer a reliable safeguard against economic and political uncertainties in an unstable global environment.

The golden visa scheme enables high net worth persons to establish residence in financially advantageous jurisdictions whilst securing comprehensive residential rights, including access to employment, educational institutions and healthcare facilities in the host country.

Some Available Golden Visa Programmes for Indians

According to an ET report, despite tightening regulations, Indian applicants can still access several golden visa schemes:

Portugal continues to offer residency through investments in qualified funds, scientific research initiatives, or business expansion projects.

Greece has adjusted its programme, raising the real estate investment threshold to €400,000, whilst offering a €250,000 alternative route through local startup investments.

Spain's scheme remains accessible to investors who submitted applications prior to 2024, despite plans to discontinue the programme.

Malta maintains its citizenship by investment option, subject to thorough background checks.

Various Caribbean nations, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Lucia, provide passports for investments beginning at $200,000.

The UAE golden visa programme continues to welcome Indian investors and professionals from essential sectors, including healthcare, technology, and business.

Singapore's Global Investor Program, whilst not technically a golden visa, enables permanent residency through substantial local business investments.

Golden visa programmes: Countries around the world are strengthening restrictions on unauthorised immigration, whilst maintaining pathways for investment-based residency. Investment visa schemes provide opportunities to obtain residential status or nationality through monetary commitments. Although traditionally popular amongst Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern investors, these programmes now draw applicants from across the globe.Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis. These are linked to applicants making qualifying financial contributions, including property acquisition, enterprise establishment or state fund deposits. The flexible residency requirements of certain programmes appeal to those seeking alternative options whilst retaining freedom of movement.A golden visa programme is a legal pathway where qualified individuals receive residential privileges in a country by making specified financial investments. This differs from citizenship-by-investment schemes, which provide complete citizenship benefits. Through golden visas, wealthy individuals can obtain legal residency status, allowing them to live, pursue employment, education and access healthcare services in their chosen nation.Nations increasingly provide residence and citizenship through investment schemes such as golden visa programmes, featuring diverse investment choices tailored to individual family needs.Golden passports provide ""citizenship by investment”. They deliver comprehensive citizenship privileges, frequently including admission to regional economic zones. Within the European Union, Malta's scheme enables investors to live, work and pursue education across all EU member states. In the Caribbean region, nations including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Grenada provide competitive options beginning at approximately $200,000.US President Donald Trump has introduced the ""gold card"" scheme as a replacement for the existing EB-5 visa system. This initiative would grant residency rights and citizenship prospects in exchange for a $5 million investment. Unlike the current EB-5 programme, the proposed scheme suggests direct payment to the US government to address national debt. This arrangement could present an alternative solution for Indian investors facing extensive waiting periods in the current employment-based green card system.",Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis.

In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year, whilst the non-vegetarian thali showed an increase due to higher broiler prices.

The vegetarian thali saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February, whereas the non-vegetarian thali registered an increase of approximately 6%:

The reduction in vegetarian thali cost was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder

was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder Tomato prices reduced to Rs 23/kg from Rs 32/kg, showing a 28% decrease year-on-year, due to 20% increased supply

LPG costs decreased by 11% year-on-year (to Rs 803 per 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi from Rs 903) providing additional savings

The decline would have been more substantial if not for the increased prices of onion (11%), potato (16%) and vegetable oil (18%) year-on-year, says CRISIL.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices. Broiler (chicken), which constitutes approximately 50% of a non-vegetarian thali's cost, saw this increase due to previous year's low baseline when prices had fallen because of oversupply.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Additionally, higher feed expenses, resulting from a 6% year-on-year increase in maize prices, contributed to the overall cost surge.During the month, both vegetarian and nonvegetarian thali costs decreased by 5% compared to the previous month. This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%). Additionally, broiler (chicken) prices fell by an estimated 5% month-on-month due to reduced demand following bird flu concerns in southern India.","In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year.

Cash flows in top 5 IT firms

BENGALURU: Indian IT firms generated around $20 billion in free cash flows last year, and more than 75% was returned to shareholders. Industry experts believe Indian IT firms are in for a big reset, especially with AI disrupting the linear relationship between revenue and employment.The Indian IT sector is reeling under a single-digit growth cycle. Its mainstay financial services business is under pressure, and lower discretionary spending provides a limited runway for growth. Besides, Indian developers are bracing for challenges from AI advancements, particularly as basic & intermediate-level coding tasks become increasingly automated.The top five Indian IT firms had free cash flows of nearly $13 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. In a recent LinkedIn post, Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, who serves as a partner at Catalincs, a technology growth advisory firm, raised an intriguing question: Can Indian IT deploy a part of its free cash flow as “risk capital”? Can it help prevent “techolonization”?“A commonly heard argument is that the IT services sector, given its asset-light model, does not require significant investment. When growth is suboptimal, the priority is often to return cash to shareholders. While this reasoning holds, the landscape is changing. With hundreds of billions of dollars locked into opportunities created by multiple structural shifts in technology and business, isn’t now an opportune moment for companies to capitalize on these shifts by reinvesting in the business and leaping into the future instead of playing by yesterday’s rules?” Ramamoorthy wrote.Namratha Dharshan, chief business leader at ISG, said the industry is at an inflection point.” Many of the IT majors recognise that the traditional business models amidst a fast-changing technology landscape will not be sufficient to address the needs that will arise in the future. IT services companies must strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and meeting shareholder expectations for predictable returns .”Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research, said smart Indian IT firms must focus more on reinvesting their cash into broadening their global capabilities , especially considering the recent changes with the US administration and the current state of global trade and geopolitics. “If they just focus on pleasing their shareholders’ short-term needs, they will struggle long-term if they expect the same old traditional business to keep growing at 10% a year.”Fersht said there is an increasing concern from US industry leaders that all their exports of work outside the US will come under the spotlight as new tariff programmes get rolled out. “The impact would result in big hikes in costs, which could be as high as the 25% level, considering the current tariffs that are being set. Why stop at Mexico, Canada, China, and the EU?”Ramamoorthy pointed out potential avenues to explore strategic investments leveraging cash flows for growth. “There are abundant opportunities for the industry and for well-run companies with predictable cash flows. Could they use their substantial cash flows as ""risk capital"" (akin to what Alibaba or Tencent did) to take minority stakes in promising next-gen companies that are into products, platforms, deep tech, and more? Second, could a consortium of these cash-rich companies invest in building India’s much-needed compute, AI, cloud, and cyber infrastructure and benefit from it, rather than leaving this critical task largely to the govt?”","The Indian IT sector is reeling under a single-digit growth cycle.

MUMBAI: Value Attics Reinsurance has received a reinsurance licence from insurance regulator Irdai, making it the first private-sector reinsurer . This ends the five-decade monopoly of the public-sector reinsurer GIC Re . The approval was granted at Irdai’s board meeting, the last meet under chairman Debasish Panda, whose term ends this week. Govt has invited applications for the post.Value Attics is backed by Canadian investor Prem Watsa ’s Fairfax group and Kamlesh Goyal. Watsa, who has already floated Go Digit General and Life Insurance with Goyal, is expanding his presence in India's insurance sector. However, the reinsurance firm will not be linked to the direct insurance business.The company will begin operations with a paid-up capital of Rs 200 crore, bringing expertise from Watsa’s global reinsurance businesses, while leveraging its balance sheet to underwrite large risks. Future investments are expected to be much higher, given that promoters have invested Rs 4,400 crore in Go Digit General Insurance and Rs 1,400 crore in Go Digit Life Insurance, which are less capital-intensive than reinsurance.Fairfax has many subsidiaries engaged in reinsurance worldwide. These include Odyssey Reinsurance in Connecticut, which underwrites treaty and facultative reinsurance and specialty insurance, Allied World Assurance, which offers reinsurance through its subsidiaries, and Polish Re, which operates in Central and Eastern Europe.Before launching Value Attics, Watsa had attempted to buy ITI Reinsurance from Sudhir Valia, but the deal was rejected by Irdai over concerns that it amounted to trading licences, which is not permitted under Indian regulations. In board meet, Irdai took stock of the progress of Risk-Based Capital implementation and the status of Ind AS adoption in insurance companies, reflecting ongoing efforts to align with global financial standards.",Value Attics Reinsurance has received a reinsurance licence from insurance regulator Irdai.

Starlink to look into ‘control centre, interception’ issues





Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked Elon Musk ’s satellite venture Starlink to set up a control centre in India to enable suspension or shutdown of communications services in sensitive and troubled areas, whenever required, to maintain law and order.Also, the security establishment has specified mandates to allow call interceptions by law-enforcement agencies through official channels when the need arises, top sources told TOI. The move comes as Starlink’s application for a satellite communications licence enters the final phase with the company stitching up agreements with Reliance Jio and Airtel for marketing, deployment and network enhancement.A control centre is important as sudden changes in law-and-order situations in any part of the country may require immediate suspension and shutdown of communications services, including those offered through satellites. We cannot be expected to knock on their (Starlink’s) doors or approach their headquarters in the US whenever such an exigency arises,” a source told TOI, adding the company has assured govt it is looking into the matter.The telecom law has provisions that allow the central or a state govt to even take “temporary possession” of any telecom service or network from an authorised entity in case of a public emergency, including disaster management, or in the interest of public safety. Besides there are provisions for internet shutdown.On the issue of interception, the sources clarified that “it is nothing new” and is also a mandate for the existing terrestrial networks being run by companies such as Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea.“For this, the satcom companies have been asked not to transfer calls directly through the satellite network and instead route them back to their India gateway and then use the channel taken by any conventional communication service — such as a call emanating from a landline or a terrestrial mobile phone service,” the source said.If one will use a satellite phone service to call someone in France, then the call will travel from the user and move to the satellite but it will not travel directly to France through the satellite route but return to the company’s India gateway ‘point of presence’ (PoP) before taking conventional telecom channels, such as underseas cable.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday suggested to industry that it was imperative to shed some protectionism as the world was looking at reciprocity, while assuring exporters that govt was working overtime to protect their interests.“Reflecting on reciprocal tariffs , he has cautioned the EPCs (export promotion councils) to come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence,” an official statement said.Some industries, such as pharma and engineering goods, especially auto parts, appeared nervous in the wake of US president Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff threat. The UK and EU too are seeking sharp cuts in duties, arguing that levies in India are high.“MSME Exporters are a worried lot. Total exports of $5 billion dollars are hit by recent tariff imposed by Donald Trump… Since voyage time to the US is approximately 60 days, about $1 billion is in the high seas and will be affected by this duty,” said EEPC India chairman Pankaj Chadha, referring to the decision to increase duties on iron and steel products to 25%.Commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal, however, sought to comfort industry, suggesting that labour intensive sectors will be shielded. While outlining the focus of the proposed agreement, Barthwal told exporters that the idea was to lower duties and reduce non-tariff barriers and asked industry representatives to share their aggressive interests, sources told TOI. Besides, businesses have been asked to identify inputs and products where sourcing can be diversified, in what is seen as a message to buy from the US to reduce the trade surplus and address Trump’s top concern.The comments came amid repeated attacks by American president Donald Trump over India’s “high tariffs” and the threat to impose reciprocal tariffs against countries that levy higher duties than those charged in the US, starting April 2.Goyal said that govt is working on several tracks, negotiating with multiple trading partners to ensure the best interests of Indian exporters. “Indicating that govt has reached final stages in FTAs with few in particular, the minister was positive that it will lead to much better opportunities for Indian exporters and will also bring in higher investment,” the statement said.Staring at a second consecutive year of decline in goods exports, commerce department on Thursday asked exporters to push shipments during the remaining fortnight of March to reach as close to last year’s level of $437 billion. While overall exports — including goods and services — are expected to cross $800 billion during the current fiscal year, minister Piyush Goyal asked exporters to target $900 billion during 2025-26.","Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal suggested to industry that it was imperative to shed some protectionism.

MUMBAI: RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra on Thursday urged banks to strengthen risk management frameworks to address credit risks associated with emerging green technologies, which have limited reliability and efficiency track records. “Regulated entities need to develop suitable capacity and technical know-how to better appraise risks in financing projects using such green technologies,” he said at the Policy Seminar on Climate Change Risks and Finance in New Delhi.Malhotra stressed the need for financial institutions to prepare for climate-related risks, which impact both individual entities and the broader financial system. “Climate-related changes are clear and visible. They are intensifying and threatening ecosystems, livelihoods, and economies,” he said, calling for collective action.RBI is undertaking measures, such as stress testing and scenario analysis, to assess the financial impact of climate risks. “Our goal is to make a realistic estimation of climate risks on the financial system. This requires comprehensive assessment, which is no easy task,” he said. To bridge data gaps, RBI is developing the Reserve Bank — Climate Risk Information System (RB-CRIS), which will provide standardised datasets on climate risks, including hazard data, sectoral transition pathways, and carbon emission intensity data.To promote climate financing, RBI has included small renewable energy projects in priority sector lending to ensure credit access for green initiatives. However, Malhotra noted that a lack of bankable projects remains a challenge. “Creation of a common pool of such projects will have multi-fold benefits for the ecosystem,” he said, urging financial institutions to collaborate.He also highlighted global coordination efforts, pointing to the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which provides technical guidance for managing climate-related financial risks . “We will continue working to build a financial system that can withstand future climate shocks and contribute to India's sustainable and resilient future,” he said.RBI plans to introduce further initiatives, including a dedicated cohort on climate change risks under its Regulatory Sandbox programme and a special ‘Greenathon’ focused on sustainable finance. Malhotra called for greater collaboration among financial institutions, regulators, and urged govt to ensure a harmonised regulatory approach.","Malhotra stressed the need for financial institutions to prepare for climate- related risks. “Climate-related changes are intensifying and threatening ecosystems, livelihoods, and economies,” he said.

Trump's USA shows a red flag to green card holders' political activism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-usa-shows-a-red-flag-to-green-card-holders-political-activism/articleshow/118898162.cms,"Donald Trump

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

The Trump administration has a clear message to foreign students and green card holders who espouse views inimical to the security of the United States: expect to be deported to your home country.In a significantly broader interpretation of existing US laws with regards to deportation of legal residents, Senior Trump administration officials on Monday indicated they had little tolerance for political activism by foreign students and resident aliens, such as the anti-Israeli protests in many liberal US college campuses, which they see as tantamount to support for terrorist outfits like Hamas .""No one has the “right” to a visa or a green card. If you support terrorism we don’t want you here,"" WhiteHouse Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Trump's Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller said, even as a New York judge ordered the administration to not to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student of Columbia University who has been arrested for his purported support to the Palestinian cause in campus demonstrations.Also read: Why is US trying to deport green-card holder Mahmoud Khalil? Five questions answered ""Vast numbers of foreign nationals who support terrorism and reject American values have been awarded visas. Revoking them is a national security imperative,"" Miller, an anti-immigration hardliner, said in a post on X, adding, ""We must only admit this who embrace the core principles of our civilization.""Administration officials have not laid out the case for Khalil's arrest and deportation clearly, but Trump's border czar Tom Homan, tasked with deporting illegal immigrants from the US, warned that the Palestinian activist could be the first of many legal foreign nationals who could be sent packing despite having US permanent residency (green cards) -- because their political activism, which the Trump administration sees as supporting terrorism, violates US laws.""Did he violate the terms of his visa? Did he violate the terms of his residency here, you know, committing crimes, attacking Israeli students, locking down buildings, destroying property? Absolutely,"" Homan told Fox Business, even though the administration has yet to press charges in court.""Any resident alien who commits a crime is eligible for deportation,"" Homan said, making the case that the campus demonstrations was more than just a protest over the retributory Israeli attack on Gaza.The Homeland Security department, where Homan is in charge of enforcement and removal operations as Trump's border czar, said Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, has been arrested for ""activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization"" as part of its commitment to ""enforcing President Trump’s executive orders and to protecting US national security.""While New York Judge Jesse Furman has stayed Khalil's deportation saying he will review a petition challenging the legality of the detention, the State Department is expected to rely on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that says any “alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.”Homan said Khalil could be the first of many immigrants who may be deported despite having green cards, echoing President Trump, who stepped into the issue to say, ""ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of @Columbia University. This is the first arrest of many to come.""“We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,"" Trump said, even as the issue has become a lightning rod and a test case for the US First Amendment relating to free speech.Several Democratic lawmakers, including Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, of Palestinian and Somali heritage respectively, have objected to Khalil's detention and possible deportation, saying the administration's ""illegal action set a dangerous precedent"" with regards to the constitutional rights to free speech and due process. Blowback from MAGA has been swift: They need to be deported too -- even if they happen to be naturalized citizens.","The Trump administration has a clear message to foreign students and green card holders who espouse views inimical to the security of the United States: expect to be deported.

BHOPAL: After presenting the budget in the assembly on Wednesday, finance minister and deputy CM Jagdish Devda said that doubling the size of the state budget in the next five years, increasing capital investment, extension of road, irrigation and power facilities, attracting investment for quality health facilities and employment generation rounded out the budget's focus.Devda termed it as ""Janta Ka Budget Janta Ke Liye""- and said that efforts were made to obtain suggestions from the public and include them in the budget. Over 1500 budget suggestions were received this year, he said.Devda further went on to address loans taken from Centre,and the timeline of fulfiling Ladli Behna promises.Devda also talked about the govt being cornered for taking frequent loans and said the loan is taken for development works and the state is within the limit in which it can take loan. As per official records, the total loan of the state has crossed Rs 4.25 lakh crore and will further go up as the year ends.Questioned on when the money under the Mukhya Mantri Laadli Behna Yojana will be increased from Rs 1250 to Rs 3000, which was promised by the govt during launch of scheme before 2023 assembly elections, Devda parried the query by saying that the govt's promise stretches for five years and so the state govt can fulfill its promise in five years.The finance minister pointed out that to ensure accuracy in budget, zero-based budgeting (ZBB) technique was introduced for the first time this year. Officials said MP was the first state in the country to adopt zero-based budgeting. As a result, around 2000 budget lines have been corrected, and unused budget heads merged with ongoing schemes to improve efficiency, officials said.Last year, Devda presented an annual state budget of Rs 3.65 lakh crore for the year 2024–25.

US stocks fall amid rising trade tensions despite positive economic reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-fall-amid-rising-trade-tensions-despite-positive-economic-reports/articleshow/118987990.cms,"US market (Photo-AP)

US stock markets saw a decline on Thursday, as President Trump’s ongoing trade war overshadowed encouraging economic news. Despite reports indicating that inflation was slowing and unemployment remained low, market uncertainty persisted due to new tariff threats from the Trump administration.The S&P 500 dropped by 0.9% in midday trading, continuing its recent volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 324 points (0.8%), and the Nasdaq composite saw a 1.3% decrease. The market’s instability has been marked by frequent shifts in performance, with the Dow swinging between slight gains and significant drops, according to news agency AP.President Trump intensified trade tensions by threatening to impose 200% tariffs on European wines, including Champagne, if the EU does not reverse its tariff on US whiskey. This move comes after the EU retaliated against US tariffs on European steel and aluminium. These developments have raised concerns among investors about the potential long-term impact on the economy, particularly regarding inflation and stagnation.Many businesses and households in the US have already expressed concern about the uncertainty caused by Trump’s unpredictable trade policies, with some companies noting changes in consumer behaviour. The growing fear is that this unpredictability could lead to a scenario where the economy stagnates while inflation rises, a situation known as stagflation.On a positive note, two economic reports released on Thursday offered a silver lining. One report showed that wholesale inflation in February was lower than expected, suggesting that price pressures might be easing. Another report indicated that fewer US workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, signalling a strong job market, which is crucial for maintaining consumer spending, the main engine of economic growth.However, Chris Larkin from E-Trade warned that while inflation reports were positive, they might not be able to cut through the noise of the trade conflict. ""The question for markets is whether good news on the inflation front can make itself heard above the noise of the ever-changing tariff story,"" Larkin said.Stocks related to the artificial intelligence (AI) industry also faced pressure. Palantir Technologies, for example, saw a 5.4% drop, while Super Micro Computer lost 5.2%. Nvidia, a major player in the AI field, initially fell but regained some ground, ending the day up 0.4%. These companies, which had experienced significant growth amid the AI boom, are now under scrutiny due to concerns over their high valuations and sustainability.On the upside, Intel saw a significant gain, jumping 14.9% after naming Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO. Tan, an experienced semiconductor executive, will take the helm next week, following the unexpected retirement of Intel’s previous CEO amid challenges at the company.In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.30%, continuing a downward trend since January. This decline reflects shifting expectations for US economic growth as traders adjust their outlook in response to the broader economic uncertainty.","The S&P 500 dropped by 0.9% in midday trading, continuing its recent volatility.

US wholesale inflation flat in February amid looming trade war risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-wholesale-inflation-flat-in-february-amid-looming-trade-war-risks/articleshow/118987392.cms,"US Wholesale inflation flat in February

US wholesale inflation showed signs of slowing down in February, indicating that price pressures may be easing. However, this trend could be short-lived as President Donald Trump escalates his trade wars with global partners, potentially driving inflation higher.The Labour Department reported Thursday that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures inflation before it reaches consumers, remained unchanged from January. This followed a 0.6% increase in January. Compared to the previous year, producer prices rose 3.2%, a decrease from the 3.7% annual increase reported in January, news agency AP reported.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core wholesale prices dropped by 0.1% in February, marking the first decline since July. Core producer prices were up 3.4% from a year earlier, down from a 3.8% increase in January. These results were lower than economists' expectations.This report comes as President Trump intensifies his trade wars, which could disrupt the progress made in controlling inflation. He has implemented 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium and placed a 20% levy on Chinese imports. In the coming weeks, additional tariffs of 25% will be imposed on Canada and Mexico, and Trump is also considering “reciprocal tariffs” that would match taxes imposed by other countries on US products.On Thursday, the president threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne, and spirits if Europe proceeds with tariffs on US whiskey.Many major retailers have warned that higher costs, partly driven by Trump's tariffs, could lead to reduced consumer spending this year.In a separate report on Wednesday, the Labour Department said that consumer inflation slowed for the first time since September. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.8% year-over-year, down from 3% in January. Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, increased by 3.1% from a year ago, the smallest annual rise since April 2021.Wholesale gasoline prices dropped by 4.7% in February, while food prices increased by 1.7%, driven by a sharp 28% rise in the price of eggs.Following three rate cuts in late 2024, the Federal Reserve is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in its upcoming meeting. Analysts Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics noted, “The Fed will not see any argument for pushing interest rates lower or sooner based on today’s figures.” They emphasized that the Fed is now more focused on the potential impact of tariffs on future food prices than on the rise in egg prices reflected in recent PPI numbers.Wholesale prices are an important indicator of future consumer inflation trends, and economists closely monitor them, especially since components like healthcare and financial services feed into the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure—the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Thomas Ryan of Capital Economics pointed out that some wholesale prices, such as hospital costs and international airfares, were higher than expected in February, which could indicate further inflationary pressures.","Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures inflation before it reaches consumers, remained unchanged from January.

The cultural boycott: Artists and businesses take a stand

The backlash against US policies isn’t just economic—it’s cultural.

In classical music, renowned German violinist Christian Tetzlaff publicly canceled his upcoming US tour, telling the New York Times that Trump’s authoritarian policies made it impossible for him to perform in good conscience.

In Norway, the country’s largest fuel supplier, Haltbakk Bunkers, announced it would no longer supply fuel to US Navy ships. The company’s CEO cited Trump’s treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a White House visit as a key reason.

Even some American allies are re-evaluating their stance. A spokesperson for the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) told DW that while they don’t yet have a formal position on boycotting US goods, they are closely watching how tariffs will impact European consumers.

US President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariffs—initially targeting Canada, Mexico, and China before expanding to all steel and aluminum imports—are triggering an international consumer backlash. Across Europe and Canada, boycott campaigns against US products are gaining momentum, with businesses and consumers rejecting American goods in response to what they see as unfair trade policies and Trump’s increasingly combative rhetoric toward allies.The movement is being fuelled by a mix of economic retaliation, nationalist sentiment, and frustration with Trump’s foreign policy. The impact is already being felt in industries ranging from liquor and tourism to automobiles and technology.According to an Axios report, searches for “Boycott USA” have skyrocketed globally, particularly in Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, France, and Canada, per Google Trends data. Facebook groups dedicated to boycotting US-made products have amassed tens of thousands of members, with calls for consumers to buy local or European alternatives instead.In Canada, Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other goods have been met with a surge of patriotic consumer activism. Many Canadian businesses are urging shoppers to prioritize homegrown products, while provincial governments have taken steps to remove US-made goods from official contracts and retail shelves.In Europe, frustration over Trump’s trade policies has combined with his broader foreign policy decisions, including his comments on Nato and his attempt to acquire Greenland, to fuel resentment toward American brands.The boycott movement has extended beyond economic actions, with cultural figures and businesses alike distancing themselves from the US.The boycott may be impacting Tesla, one of the most recognizable US brands in Europe and Canada. Sales of Tesla vehicles in Europe plummeted 45% year-over-year in January, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).Some analysts suggest this could be linked to CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with Trump. As a senior adviser to the Trump administration and head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has been increasingly associated with the president’s policies. This connection could be hurting Tesla’s image among European and Canadian consumers.Trump weighed in on Truth Social this week, dismissing the Tesla boycott as an illegal left-wing conspiracy:While it's too early to quantify the full impact of the “Boycott USA” movement, some American business leaders are already voicing concern.As per the DW article, Takeshi Niinami, CEO of Japanese drinks giant Suntory Holdings, which owns Jim Beam, warned that US brands would suffer internationally due to both tariffs and anti-Trump sentiment.European retailers are making it easier for consumers to avoid American goods. Denmark’s Salling Group, one of the country’s largest retailers, is tagging European products with a black star so customers can identify them more easily.With Trump ramping up nationalist rhetoric ahead of the 2024 election, global resistance to US trade policies could deepen. Some analysts predict that if the boycott continues, American companies may need to rebrand or shift manufacturing to non-US locations to avoid consumer rejection.Meanwhile, Canada and European nations are weighing further economic retaliation. Canadian officials have warned that if Trump escalates tariffs, they will respond with “dollar-for-dollar” countermeasures.At the same time, US tourism officials are scrambling to counteract the drop in Canadian visitors. The US Travel Association (USTA) had forecast a 5% increase in Canadian visitors for 2025, but that now appears unlikely, according to industry experts.What started as a trade dispute has escalated into a full-blown consumer rebellion against US products. The “Boycott USA” movement reflects growing frustration with Trump’s policies and has the potential to impact American brands, tourism, and even global diplomacy for years to come.(With inputs from agencies)","The search for ""Boycott USA"" has spiked on Google in last few days. Trump’s suggestion that the US could “buy” Greenland sparked outrage in Denmark, where a Facebook group called “Boycott Goods from the US” has nearly 73,000 members. Sweden has seen one of the strongest pushes against US goods.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118984490,imgsize-27618,width-400,resizemode-4/118984490.jpg"
Pharma industry pushes back against study linking generics to increased health risks in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/indian-pharma-industry-pushes-back-against-study-linking-generics-to-increased-health-risks-in-us/articleshow/118979754.cms,"Representative Image

A recent study linking Indian-made generic drugs to a higher risk of serious side effects in the United States has sparked a strong backlash from the industry’s most influential lobby group.This comes as India defends its dominant share in the global pharmaceutical market amid rising trade tensions under President Donald Trump's administration.In response to the findings, the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, representing the country's largest drugmakers, issued a statement, disagreeing with the study's premise. They strongly rejected the notion that factors like manufacturing and distribution practices contribute to the quality and efficacy issues in Indian generic drugs, according to a Bloomberg report.""We strongly disagree with the study’s premise that differences in operations and supply chain factors—suppliers, manufacturing and/or distribution practices by different manufacturers—impact the quality and efficacy of Indian generic drugs,"" Bloomberg reported the pharma group statement.The study, which analysed more than 2,400 drugs sold in the US between 2009 and 2018, found that Indian generics were associated with a 54% greater risk of serious adverse events—including hospitalization, disability, and death—compared to domestically made medicines. The researchers attribute these findings to operational and supply chain issues during the manufacturing process as the ""most likely"" cause. The study was published last month in the journal Production and Operations Management.The study adds to growing concerns over the quality of Indian-made medicines, with India being the world’s largest supplier of generic drugs. The country produces around 20% of the global supply and meets approximately 40% of the US demand for non-patented medications.Between 2018 and 2024, US pharmaceutical imports from India are expected to nearly double to $13 billion, highlighting the growing influence of India's pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, President Trump has pushed for companies to bring production back to the US, warning of tariffs of up to 25%, a move that could increase costs for pharmaceutical companies.While regulatory lapses at Indian factories, including unsanitary conditions and poorly trained staff, have raised concerns internationally, the situation was further exacerbated by incidents like the 2022 deaths of dozens of children in Gambia and Uzbekistan due to tainted cough syrup and more recent cases of contaminated eye drops causing blindness in US patients.The authors of the recent study suggested that ""quality corner-cutting"" due to cost pressures may explain the higher adverse event risk. They noted that older drugs were more frequently associated with these events, possibly because manufacturers were under increasing pressure to reduce operational and supply chain costs over time, Bloomberg reported.The Indian pharmaceutical industry has pushed back against the conclusions drawn in the study, citing limitations in the use of adverse event data. They argue that such data often suffers from reporting biases and cannot establish direct causality. The Indian Pharma Alliance further noted that both the industry and regulators have made significant progress in engaging with the US FDA to address manufacturing and quality issues, with FDA inspections playing a key role in quality enforcement.The study authors, however, emphasized the need for stronger FDA oversight , particularly through unannounced inspections. According to their findings, FDA inspections of Indian factories increased by 46% from 2014 to 2024, with instances of objectionable conditions rising by 38% during the same period.They also urged drug manufacturers to focus on improving transparency and quality, suggesting that better manufacturers could potentially leverage superior quality to attract more buyers, while inferior producers could be driven out of the market.“The FDA mandates things, but firms can voluntarily do quite a bit on their own.” The researchers called for the inclusion of quality data on labels and for drugmakers to benchmark themselves against peers, improving the overall standards of the industry.","Study links Indian-made generic drugs to a higher risk of serious side effects in the United States.

Why is Intel struggling?



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Chipmaker giant Intel appointed tech industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new chief executive on Wednesday, who would be assuming his role from March 18, 2025.The move pushed the company shares soaring more than 10 per cent in after market trade.Bu Tan’s appointment comes at a crucial time when the tech firm is struggling to reclaim its dominance in the industry. Tan is also scheduled to join the board of directors from August. As Intel’s new chief, Tan inherited a company once at the top in the computer component manufacturing sector, however as rivals like Nvidia, Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung have emerged as new leaders, the company is grappling with massive losses.Intel's interim CEO Frank D Yeary said, “We are delighted to have Lip-Bu as our CEO as we work to accelerate our turnaround and capitalize on the significant growth opportunities ahead.""In a statement released by the company Tan said, “Intel has a powerful and differentiated computing platform, a vast customer installed base and a robust manufacturing footprint that is getting stronger by the day as we rebuild our process technology roadmap.”“I am eager to join the company and build upon the work the entire Intel team has been doing to position our business for the future,” he added.The company is hoping to regain its position as the semiconductor leader with the decision though Tan told the Intel team that ""won't be easy"" to overcome challenges faced by the company.Lip-Bu Tan is an experienced CEO with a track record in the computer software sector and has played a key role in shaping the semiconductor landscape.Born in Malaysia, Tan is a well-renowned figure in the semiconductor industry . He made his mark as the CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a leading chip design software company, from 2009 to 2021. Intel reported that under his leadership, Cadence increased its revenue to more than double.Tan has a bachelor’s degree in science, from the Nanyang Technological University Singapore. He also studied masters of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, after which he went on to pursue an MBA at the University of San Francisco.He was also awarded an honorary doctor’s degree in May 2022, by the University of San Francisco.In 2022, he received the Robert N Noyce Award, the Semiconductor Industry Association’s highest honor.Tan is looking forward “to remake our company at one of the most pivotal moments in its history,” with his new role.Yeary said, “I have worked closely with Lip-Bu in the past and have seen firsthand how his relentless attention to customers drives innovation and success.”Intel’s struggle can be mainly attributed to its failure to capitalise on the AI boom while its competitors like Nvidia have earned its position in the newly emerging AI realm. The struggles can be seen in its financial performance, reporting a staggering $18.8 billion net loss in 2024.Lip-Bu Tan’s predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was forced out as Intel’s CEO in December last year after the board lost confidence in his turnaround strategy. His sudden departure followed a series of drastic measures, including a plan to cut over 15,000 jobs and the decision to halt or delay construction on multiple chipmaking facilities as part of a major cost-cutting effort.Last year, the Biden administration awarded Intel $7.9 billion as part of an effort to boost semiconductor production in the US, but in February, the company slowed down the construction of two new chip plants in Ohio, citing a cautious approach to the $28 billion project.",Chipmaker giant Intel appointed tech industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new chief executive on Wednesday.

When Donald Trump was sworn in as the United States President on January 20, he was surrounded by some of the globe's most affluent individuals. The billionaires in attendance - including Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg - were at their peak wealth, benefiting from robust stock market performance.However, after seven weeks, circumstances have shifted dramatically. The commencement of Trump's second term has resulted in significant financial setbacks for five billionaires who were present at the Capitol Rotunda, with their combined wealth declining by $209 billion, as reported by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The interval between Trump's election and inauguration proved profitable for the world's wealthiest individuals, with the S&P 500 Index reaching numerous record highs. Investors were drawn to equity and crypto markets, anticipating business-friendly policies under Trump.Musk's Tesla Inc. experienced a 98% increase post-election, achieving a record high. Arnault's LVMH rose 7% in the week preceding Inauguration Day, increasing the French businessman's wealth by $12 billion. Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc., despite banning Trump in 2021, gained 9% before the new term and an additional 20% during his first four weeks in office.However, expectations of continued market growth under Trump's new term have been disrupted. The S&P 500 has decreased by 6.4% since his inauguration, with government employee redundancies and uncertainty regarding tariffs affecting equities, leading to a 2.7% decline on Monday.The corporations associated with the inauguration attendees have experienced substantial losses, with their combined market value dropping by $1.39 trillion since January 17, the final trading day before the inauguration. Here's an examination of these fortunes:Tesla CEO Elon Musk, 53, saw his net worth reach a record $486 billion on Dec. 17, the highest ever recorded on Bloomberg's wealth index. His wealth surge was largely driven by Tesla’s stock, which nearly doubled post-election. However, Tesla has since lost all those gains, with European consumers turning away due to Musk’s political affiliations. In Germany, Tesla sales plunged over 70% in early 2024, while Chinese shipments fell 49% last month—the lowest since July 2022.Bezos, 61, who earlier clashed with Trump over the postal service and his ownership of the Washington Post during the president's first term, congratulated Trump the day after the election on Musk's X. Not only this, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund in December, and Bezos dined with the president last month, the same day that Bezos announced that his newspaper will prioritize personal liberties and free markets in its opinion section. Amazon shares have fallen 14% since Jan. 17.Brin, aged 51, a co-founder of the original Google alongside Larry Page, maintains a 6% ownership stake. He participated in demonstrations at San Francisco airport in 2017, opposing the Trump administration's immigration measures. Following Trump's re-election in November, Brin attended a dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago in the subsequent month. In early February, Alphabet Inc. experienced a significant share price decline of over 7% after failing to meet quarterly revenue projections. Recently, Alphabet's representatives, whilst facing pressure from the Justice Department regarding the potential break-up of its search engine operations, engaged in discussions with government officials, requesting a more moderate approach.Meta emerged as the top performer among the Magnificent Seven technology companies in early 2024. Whilst these influential companies, which have driven substantial gains in the S&P 500 index over recent years, showed stagnant performance, Meta achieved a 19% increase between mid-January and mid-February. However, the company subsequently relinquished these advances. The Magnificent Seven index has experienced a 20% decline from its peak in mid-December.Arnault, aged 76, whose family controls the luxury group that owns prestigious brands such as Louis Vuitton and Bulgari, has maintained a long-standing friendship with Trump spanning decades. He conversed with the then-candidate the day following the Pennsylvania assassination attempt in July. LVMH shares, after showing a downward trend through most of 2024, experienced a significant rise of over 20% from the election period until late January. However, the company has subsequently lost the majority of these gains. According to Morningstar analysts' statement last month, a potential tariff ranging from 10% to 20% on European luxury goods could adversely affect sales, which are already experiencing difficulties.","The interval between Trump's election and inauguration proved profitable for the world's wealthiest individuals.

Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday, extending a turbulent period of losses as uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies continued to shake investor confidence.Trump said late in the afternoon that he would “probably” reconsider doubling planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, just hours after announcing a sharp hike. The back-and-forth on tariff measures against some of the United States’ closest trading partners has rattled markets, compounding fears of an economic slowdown.“The volatility is nothing new to us over the course of the last three weeks,” said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. He noted that market swings have been “largely driven by the uncertainty around things like tariffs.” However, he also pointed out that Tuesday marked a potential shift, saying, “For the first time in three weeks, it appears as though we might be getting a little bit of good news… there might be a window cracked open in the negotiations with Canada on tariffs.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%, closing at 41,433.48. The S&P 500 slid 0.8% to 5,572.07, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.2% to 17,436.10. The downturn followed Monday’s significant plunge, which saw the Nasdaq suffer its worst single-day loss since 2022.Since taking office, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, though he has at times walked back some levies on key trading partners.“Certainly, the longer this uncertainty persists, the more investors are willing to take money off the table and de-risk their portfolios,” Hogan added.Despite the general market decline, the Nasdaq found some support from major tech stocks. Tesla rebounded 3.8% following Trump’s announcement that he would purchase one of the company’s vehicles, while AI chipmaker Nvidia climbed 1.7% after suffering steep losses on Monday.Tuesday’s losses deepened fears that Wall Street could be heading into a correction phase. At one point during the session, the S&P 500 briefly fell more than 10% below its record high from last month, a level that professional investors define as a correction.The S&P 500 ultimately fell 0.8% but fluctuated throughout the day, at one stage dropping as much as 1.5%. The Dow lost 478 points, while the Nasdaq hovered in and out of positive territory before ending with a 0.2% loss.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%, closing at 41,433.48.

US stock markets tumbled further on Tuesday after President Donald Trump intensified his trade war by announcing a sharp increase in tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, doubling the planned hike to 50%. The move sent Wall Street reeling, with the S&P 500 falling 1.1% in afternoon trading, pushing it nearly 10% below its all-time high set just weeks ago.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 625 points, or 1.5%, by 1 p.m. Eastern time, extending a brutal stretch of volatility. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped a more modest 0.7%, as Tesla and a few Big Tech stocks managed to limit some of the broader market’s losses, according to news agency AP.The S&P 500 experienced another sharp intraday swing, flipping from a modest morning gain to a steep 1.2% decline—a pattern that has repeated throughout the past two weeks. This latest bout of wild market fluctuations reflects investors’ growing uncertainty over how much economic pain Trump is willing to inflict through tariffs in his bid to reshape global trade.While announcing the tariff increase, Trump made an eyebrow-raising statement, saying, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty-First State. This would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”His remark added to the market’s unease, as businesses and investors struggled to gauge whether further trade restrictions could follow.Beyond the immediate market selloff, Trump’s on-and-off approach to tariffs is beginning to take a toll on consumer and business confidence.Delta Air Lines, for instance, warned that customer uncertainty is already impacting demand, leading the airline to slash its revenue growth forecast for the first quarter of 2025 from 7%-9% down to 3%-4%. Delta's stock plummeted 8.5% in response.Similarly, Southwest Airlines lowered its revenue forecast, citing reduced government travel, California wildfires, and weaker demand trends. However, its stock managed to jump 8.7%, as the airline announced new baggage fees and loyalty program adjustments to boost revenue.Meanwhile, Oracle dropped 3.7% after reporting disappointing quarterly earnings, adding to the broader market’s woes.Amid the turmoil, Tesla shares rose 2.1% after Trump publicly declared his intention to purchase a Tesla vehicle as a show of support for Elon Musk’s company. Tesla’s stock has been under heavy pressure in 2025, down 43.8% year-to-date, partly due to Musk’s involvement in federal budget-cutting efforts.Other Big Tech stocks, which powered the S&P 500 to record highs last year, showed relative stability. Nvidia gained 1%, though its year-to-date loss remains at 19.6%, as Wall Street rethinks its overheated enthusiasm for artificial intelligence stocks.The tech sector’s relative resilience has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise turbulent market environment. Just seven megacap stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—accounted for more than half of the S&P 500’s total gains in 2024. However, analysts at Citi warn that “US exceptionalism is at least pausing”, suggesting that the AI boom may not be enough to offset the broader economic uncertainty in the coming months.International stock markets mirrored Wall Street’s struggles, with major European and Asian indices mostly posting declines. However, in China, Shanghai’s composite index rose 0.4%, as the Chinese government wrapped up its annual national congress with promises of economic stimulus measures.Meanwhile, US Treasury yields steadied after recent declines, with the 10-year yield rising slightly to 4.24%. The bond market has been under pressure in recent months, reflecting growing concerns about economic slowdown risks.Amid the market chaos, a new report showed that US employers posted 7.7 million job openings in January, matching economist expectations. While the job market remains solid for now, ongoing trade disruptions and market uncertainty could have long-term economic consequences.","US stock markets tumbled further on Tuesday after President Donald Trump intensified his trade war.

US job openings climbed to 7.7 million in January, reinforcing the strength of the labour market as President Donald Trump began his return to the White House. The Labour Department’s latest report, released Tuesday, showed an increase from December’s 7.5 million job postings, highlighting a still-resilient employment landscape.Despite this growth, uncertainty looms over the job market as the Trump administration pushes forward with trade disputes, federal workforce cuts, and immigration crackdowns, according to news agency AP.The report, known as the Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey (JOLTS), showed a slight decline in layoffs and an uptick in the number of Americans voluntarily leaving their jobs—a sign of worker confidence. Job openings increased in key sectors such as real estate, healthcare, manufacturing, and construction.However, federal government job postings dipped to 135,000 in January, down from 138,000 in December. The impact of layoffs stemming from billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives is expected to become more apparent in February’s labour data.“These January numbers only capture the earliest days of the DOGE-driven reductions in federal employment,” economists Carol Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics noted in a report. “While this data doesn’t yet reflect major federal layoffs, we anticipate a significant impact in the February report, set for release on April 1.”The Federal Reserve is unlikely to adjust interest rates based on this report, as it continues its cautious approach to monetary policy. “Today’s data provides no urgency for the Fed to cut rates,” Weinberg and Chen wrote. “The labour market remains stable—at least for now.”Job openings have declined from 8.5 million in January 2024 and the peak of 12.2 million in March 2022, when the economy was still rebounding from COVID-19 shutdowns. Hiring has also slowed compared to previous years: employers added an average of 168,000 jobs per month in 2024, down from 216,000 in 2023, 380,000 in 2022, and a record-breaking 603,000 in 2021.In 2025 so far, the economy added 125,000 jobs in January and 151,000 in February, while the unemployment rate remains at a historically low 4.1%.","US job openings climbed to 7.7 million in January, reinforcing the strength of the labour market as President Donald Trump began his return to the White House.

Driving the news

Tesla shares plunged more than 15% on Monday, extending their brutal year-to-date decline to nearly 45%, as investors worried about slowing sales, increased competition, and CEO Elon Musk ’s growing political entanglements.

plunged more than 15% on Monday, extending their brutal year-to-date decline to nearly 45%, as investors worried about slowing sales, increased competition, and CEO ’s growing political entanglements. Adding to Musk’s woes, his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered widespread outages, with tens of thousands of users reporting disruptions. Musk blamed a ""massive"" cyberattack that he claimed was likely orchestrated by a ""large, coordinated group and/or a country.""

The Tesla's $125 billion market cap wipeout came amid a broader selloff in US stocks. In fact, these twin crises for Musk unfolded against a broader backdrop of market panic. The Nasdaq tumbled 4%, its worst single-day performance since 2022, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones also fell sharply. Investors fear the Trump administration’s shifting stance on tariffs and economic policy could trigger a slowdown. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s warning of a “detox period” as public spending is slashed only heightened those concerns.

Tesla’s post-election rally has evaporated, with shares now trading 11% lower than they were on the day Trump won the presidency.

The big picture

Tesla’s delivery numbers are trending downward, despite aggressive price cuts and financing incentives:

Q1 deliveries are tracking for a 4% drop, according to Evercore ISI.

Tesla has launched 0% financing deals and free Supercharging to stimulate demand.

The Cybertruck launch has been rocky, with initial sales well below Musk’s estimates.

Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury: ""Tesla was already facing increased competition across all price points. Now, politics adds another layer of polarization.""

What they’re saying

Investor Doug Boneparth on X: “Massive crash in Tesla stock. Musk will be fine. Retail investors? Not so much.”

JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman: “For how much longer can the stock remain divorced from the fundamentals?”

Protest organizer Alex Winter (in Rolling Stone): “Detaching Musk from Tesla would be a meaningful blow against this administration … and a strike against what they hold most dear: money and power.”

To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is “putting it on the line” in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s “baby,” in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for. They tried to do it to me at the 2024 Presidential Ballot Box, but how did that work out? In any event, I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN??? US President Donald Trump

Between the lines: The #TeslaTakedown movement and Musk’s political troubles

Musk’s response: ‘Always look on the bright side’

X outage: Cyberattack or self-inflicted wounds?

Musk has drastically cut X’s security staff since taking over Twitter, raising questions about whether the outage was due to a cyberattack—or simply self-inflicted infrastructure failures.

Reports indicate that over 40,000 users were affected during peak outages.

Cybersecurity experts say that while botnet attacks are common, Musk’s claim that Ukraine was involved is questionable without further evidence.

Since Musk acquired X, the platform has suffered multiple technical issues—leading some analysts to blame underinvestment in infrastructure.

March 10 was a brutal day for Elon Musk-the world's wealthiest person . Tesla ’s stock took a sharp nosedive, his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered widespread outages due to what he called a “massive cyberattack,” and protests against his leadership role (DOGE) in President Donald Trump ’s administration continued across the US.Musk is facing mounting pressure on multiple fronts: Tesla’s declining sales, political backlash against his role in Trump’s administration, and growing skepticism over the company’s lofty valuation.In Europe, Tesla sales have plummeted this year—down 71% in Germany, 45% in Norway, 44% in France, and 44% in Spain. In China, the company is losing ground to domestic competitors offering cheaper and more advanced electric vehicles. Even in the US, Tesla has resorted to aggressive discounts, low-interest financing, and free Supercharging to prop up demand.Competition is heating up, with China’s BYD surpassing Tesla in EV sales and rolling out driver-assistance technology as a free feature—undercutting Tesla’s pricey Full Self-Driving (FSD) package.For years, Musk’s cult-like following helped insulate Tesla from market realities. But now, that aura is fading, especially as his deepening ties to the Trump administration alienate a growing segment of consumers.Musk’s role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—the administration’s controversial effort to slash federal agencies—has made him a polarizing political figure. His sweeping layoffs and budget cuts have sparked backlash, including nationwide protests at Tesla dealerships.The #TeslaTakedown movement has gained traction on social media, urging Tesla owners to ditch their vehicles and investors to dump their stock. Protesters gathered outside Tesla showrooms in multiple cities over the weekend, with signs reading “Stop Musk’s Crime Spree” and “Elon is Trump’s Executioner.” Some Tesla owners have even defaced or covered up their car’s logo to distance themselves from Musk, the Axios report said.Adding fuel to the fire, Musk himself has embraced right-wing rhetoric, frequently engaging with controversial figures on X. His political leanings, once seen as a sideshow, are now becoming a business liability. A growing number of consumers are rethinking their Tesla purchases, unwilling to support a CEO they view as aligned with the administration’s most extreme policies.Even some investors are starting to wonder if Musk’s political involvement is distracting him from running Tesla. The company has fallen behind in key areas—its long-promised $25,000 car was quietly scrapped last year, while competitors like China’s BYD are racing ahead with innovations. Tesla’s recent focus on robot axis and AI-driven vehicles has yet to materialize into tangible revenue, making the stock’s once-lofty valuation harder to justify.According to a report in Axios, even as his personal net worth took a $16 billion hit on March 10, Musk appeared unfazed.Asked about Tesla’s struggles in a Fox Business interview, Musk laughed it off, quoting Monty Python: ""Always look on the bright side of life!""In the past too, Musk has quoted Monty Python.His confidence has long reassured Tesla investors, but some are starting to question whether the optimism is still warranted.Tesla’s path forward is uncertain. While Musk insists the company will be fine long-term, it faces serious short-term challenges:Can Tesla reverse its sales slump? Musk has promised a $25,000 EV, but no firm timeline exists.Will political backlash grow? The #TeslaTakedown movement is planning more protests, and some Tesla owners are even selling their cars in protest.How will tariffs impact Tesla? Trump’s looming trade war with China and Europe could further hurt Tesla’s supply chain.Can Musk stabilize X? With user engagement already declining, continued outages and security concerns could push advertisers and users away.Tesla’s stock has always defied gravity—but for the first time in years, investors are wondering whether Musk’s magic is wearing off.(With inputs from agencies)","Tesla shares plunged more than 15% on Monday, extending their brutal year-to- date decline to nearly 45%. Investors worried about slowing sales, increased competition, and CEO Elon Musk ’s growing political entanglements. Adding to Musk’s woes, his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered widespread outages, with tens of thousands of users reporting disruptions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118877731,imgsize-43012,width-400,resizemode-4/118877731.jpg"

US stocks tumbled Monday as ongoing tariff disputes and concerns over a potential federal government shutdown fueled fears of a looming recession.Last week's sharp selloff continued, gaining steam throughout the session, with all three major indexes posting steep losses.The S&P 500 is now down over 8% from its February 19 all-time high, and the Nasdaq Composite has officially entered correction territory after falling more than 10% from its December peak. A mix of economic uncertainty, fears of a potential recession, and escalating trade tensions has led to a wave of selloffs, wiping out trillions in market value.Also read: BSE Sensex sinks over 400 points; Nifty50 below 22,350 Key factors contributing to this decline include high stock valuations compared to historical averages, economic uncertainty triggered by shifting trade policies, and disappointing corporate earnings. Tesla, for example, saw its market value drop by more than $125 billion in a single day. Additionally, companies like Delta Air Lines have cut their profit forecasts, citing concerns over economic conditions. Investors remain on edge as they monitor upcoming inflation reports, interest rate policies, and potential government actions to stabilize the economy.The recent selloff is driven by multiple factors, including trade policy uncertainties, fears of a potential recession, and concerns over high stock valuations. As Peter Orszag, CEO of Lazard, explains: ""The amount of uncertainty that has been created by the tariff wars with regard to Canada, Mexico and Europe is causing boards and C-suites to reconsider the pathway forward.""The S&P 500 has fallen over 8.6% from its February 19 high, erasing more than $4 trillion in market value. The Nasdaq Composite is officially in correction territory, down over 10% from its December peak.Technology stocks have suffered the most significant losses. Tesla lost $125 billion in value in a single day, while Apple and Nvidia both fell about 5%. The S&P 500’s technology sector dropped 4.3% overall. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines' stock plunged 14% after it cut its first-quarter profit estimates by half.Read also: What could be the impact of Trump's tariff flip flop on Indian stock market? Yes, investor concerns about a potential recession have intensified.In an interview broadcast on Sunday, US President Donald Trump described the current situation as “a period of transition” and didn't dismiss the possibility of a recession. When asked on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo” whether he anticipated a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, noted: ""The Trump administration seems a little more accepting of the idea that they’re OK with the market falling, and they’re potentially even OK with a recession in order to exact their broader goals.""The White House has pushed back against recession fears , insisting that the economy remains strong despite the market downturn. Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, said: ""There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.""He also suggested that the uncertainty around tariffs would be resolved soon, emphasizing that tax cuts would help boost investment and real wages. However, investors remain skeptical, with ongoing market volatility reflecting broader concerns.Investors are keeping an eye on several key factors, including the upcoming inflation report, interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, and potential government measures to stabilize the economy. A further retreat in investor confidence could push markets even lower. As Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""Many people have been worried about elevated valuations among US equities for some time and looking for the catalyst for a market correction.""With market volatility continuing, investors should stay informed and consider diversification strategies to manage risk.","The S&P 500 has fallen over 8.6% from its February 19 high, erasing more than $4 trillion in market value.

Artificial intelligence at work



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Almost every day, Grant Lee, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, hears from investors who try to persuade him to take their money. Some have even sent him and his co-founders personalised gift baskets.Lee, 41, would normally be flattered. In the past, a fast-growing startup like Gamma, an artificial intelligence company he helped establish in 2020, would have constantly looked out for more funding. But like many young startups in Silicon Valley today, Gamma is pursuing a different strategy. It is using AI tools to increase its employees’ productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research.That means Gamma, which makes software that lets people create presentations and websites, has no need for more cash, Lee said. His company has hired only 28 people to get “tens of millions” in annual recurring revenue and nearly 50 million users. Gamma is also profitable. “If we were from the generation before, we would easily be at 200 employees,” Lee said. “We get a chance to rethink that, basically rewrite the playbook.”The old Silicon Valley model dictated that startups should raise a huge sum of money from venture capital investors and spend it hiring an army of employees to scale up fast. Profits would come much later. Until then, head count and fundraising were badges of honour among founders, who philosophised that bigger was better.But Gamma is among a growing cohort of startups, most of them working on AI products, that are also using AI to maximise efficiency. They make money and are growing fast without the funding or employees they would have needed before. The biggest bragging rights for these startups are for making the most revenue with the fewest workers. Stories of “tiny team” success have now become a meme, with techies excitedly sharing lists that show how Anysphere, a startup that makes the coding software Cursor, hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than two years with just 20 employees, and how ElevenLabs, an AI voice startup, did the same with about 50 workers.The potential for AI to let startups do more with less has led to wild speculation about the future. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted there could someday be a one-person company worth $1 billion. His company, which is building a cost-intensive form of AI called a foundational model, employs more than 4,000 people and has raised more than $20 billion in funding. It is also in talks to raise more money.With AI tools, some startups are now declaring that they will stop hiring at a certain size. Runway Financial, a finance software company, has said it plans to top out at 100 employees because each of its workers will do the work of 1.5 people. Agency, a startup using AI for customer service, also plans to hire no more than 100 workers.“It’s about eliminating roles that are not necessary when you have smaller teams,” said Elias Torres, Agency’s founder. The idea of AI-driven efficiency was bolstered in Jan by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that showed it could build AI tools for a small fraction of the typical cost. Its breakthrough, built on open-source tools that are freely available online, set off an explosion of companies building new products using DeepSeek’s inexpensive techniques.“DeepSeek was a watershed moment,” said Gaurav Jain, an investor at the venture firm Afore Capital, which has backed Gamma. “The cost of compute is going to go down very, very fast, very quickly.” Jain compared new AI startups to the wave of companies that arose in the late 2000s, after Amazon began offering cheap cloud computing services. That lowered the cost of starting a company, leading to a flurry of new startups that could be built more cheaply.Before this AI boom, startups generally burned $1 million to get to $1 million in revenue, Jain said. Now, getting to $1 million in revenue costs one-fifth as much and could eventually drop to one-tenth, according to an analysis of 200 startups conducted by Afore. “This time, we’re automating humans as opposed to just the data centers,” Jain said.But if startups can become profitable without spending much, that could become a problem for venture capital investors, who allocate tens of billions to invest in AI startups. Last year, AI companies raised $97 billion in funding, making up 46% of all venture investment in the United States, according to PitchBook, which tracks startups. “Venture capital only works if you get money into the winners,” said Terrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund, which focuses on very young startups.",Gamma is using AI tools to increase its employees’ productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq led sharp losses among major US stock indexes on Monday, dropping over 3% to a near six-month low, on fears that US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies would spark an economic slowdown . The benchmark S& has fallen over 8% from its Feb high.Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks as rising trade tensions and signs of slowing US economic growth weighed on consumer confidence and business activity. Richly valued US tech stocks have borne the brunt of the recent selloff on Wall Street.“The Nasdaq has been risk-off all year long ... that’s just the unfortunate combination of very high valuations, which is where we started the year, and increased uncertainty in general,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer.The S& is poised to close below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov 2023. A Reuters poll showed 91% of economists see higher recession risks due to Trump’s shifting trade policies. HSBC also downgraded US stocks.Trump declined Sunday to rule out the possibility that the US might enter a recession this year. “I hate to predict things like that,"" he told a Fox News interviewer when asked directly about a possible recession in 2025, reported AFP.","The tech-heavy Nasdaq led sharp losses among major US stock indexes on Monday, dropping over 3% to a near six-month low.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Income Tax Changes FY 2025-26: April 1, 2025, signals the start of the fresh fiscal year. As the new financial year begins, several new income tax regulations come into effect, including a more rationalised new income tax regime, higher basic exemption limit and tax rates. Additionally, several changes in TDS, TCS rules also take effect.Understanding these new income tax rules is crucial, as they influence tax deductions from various income sources, including salary and interest earnings. Additionally, these changes will determine your tax liability for income earned in FY 2025-26.The revised new tax regime introduces new income tax slabs and rates. Under the new income tax regime income above Rs 24 lakh will now attract a 30% tax rate as against Rs 15 lakh earlier. Also, the basic exemption limit has been raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh.With changes in the new income tax regime, individuals earning a taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh will now have to pay ZERO tax! This provision applies exclusively to individuals who select the new tax regime in FY 2025-26. However, this does not exempt one from filing an income tax return (ITR). The zero tax benefit is available through a tax rebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.To access the tax rebate under Section 87A, individuals must submit their ITR. For salaried individuals earning up to Rs 12.75 lakh, there will be no tax with a Rs 75,000 standard deduction.Also Read | How to calculate income tax with latest tax slabs: Have taxable income above Rs 12 lakh? Know how it will be taxed under new income tax regime The Budget 2025 has introduced modifications to the taxation structure of specific ULIPs. The revised regulations specify that ULIP proceeds not qualifying for exemption under Section 10 (10D) shall be classified as capital assets and will be incorporated within the equity-oriented funds category, according to an ET report.Consequently, proceeds from ULIPs that do not qualify for Section 10 (10D) exemption will face capital gains taxation. A 20% tax rate applies to short-term gains, whilst long-term gains attract a 12.5% tax without the benefit of indexation.Tax exemption under Section 10 (10D) continues to apply to ULIP proceeds where the annual premium remains below Rs 2.5 lakh.Tax experts note that previously, there existed no definitive taxation guidelines for ULIPs with premiums exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh. This ambiguity arose because ULIPs, unlike conventional policies, direct a substantial portion of premiums towards stock market investments, making traditional policy taxation frameworks unsuitable. These taxation revisions take effect from FY 2025-26.The Budget 2025 has introduced modifications to TDS provisions, encompassing adjustments to rates and elevating thresholds for implementing these provisions.Key TDS amendments include:a) Section 194LBC TDS rate adjustment: This applies to income distributed by securitisation trust to resident investors. Currently, until March 31, 2025, individuals or Hindu Undivided families face 25% TDS, whilst others face 30%. Starting April 1, 2025, a uniform 10% TDS rate shall apply.b) Threshold adjustments: Effective April 1, 2025, elevated thresholds will apply to sections 193, 194A, 194, 194K, 194B, 194BB, 194D, 194G, 194H, 194-I, 194J and 194LA, enabling taxpayers to retain more disposable income.The government has eliminated provisions requiring increased TDS and TCS rates for ITR non-filers. This revision takes effect from April 1, 2025, removing higher TDS and TCS obligations for those who haven't submitted ITRs in specified periods.The Budget 2025 memorandum states: ""Section 206AB of the Act, requires deduction of tax at higher rate when the deductee specified therein is a non-filer of income-tax return. Section 206CCA of the Act, requires for collection of tax at higher rate when the collectee specified therein is a non-filer of income-tax return. This is subject to other conditions specified in the two sections. Representations were received from various stakeholders that it is difficult for the deductor/collector, at the time of deduction/collection, to verify whether returns have been filed by the deductee/collectee, resulting in application of higher rates of deduction/collection, blocking of capital and increased compliance burden. Accordingly, to address this issue and reduce compliance burden for the deductor/collector, it is proposed to omit section 206AB of the Act and section 206CCA of the Act.""Also Read | Latest income tax slabs FY 2025-26: What are the new income tax slabs, rates after Budget 2025 announcements? Check new vs old tax regime comparison - FAQs answered The recent Budget 2025 has incorporated NPS Vatsalya contributions within Section 80CCD framework. Individuals can now avail deductions for their NPS Vatsalya contributions under this section. This benefit remains exclusive to taxpayers who continue with the old tax regime.Starting April 1, 2025, the Budget has revised the tax-free perquisite thresholds for employed individuals. The updated regulations permit tax exemption on employer-funded international medical treatment expenses, covering both employees and their family members.Starting April 1, 2025, the authorities have granted immunity from legal proceedings for delayed Tax Collected at Source (TCS) payments under specific circumstances. The revised regulations specify that no legal action shall commence against individuals who remit TCS to the Central Government before the prescribed deadline for submitting quarterly statements.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime The timeframe for submitting updated returns has been lengthened. Under the revised regulations effective April 1, 2025, individuals now have 48 months from the assessment year's conclusion to submit their updated returns. Previously, taxpayers were allowed 24 months post-assessment year to file these returns. The new provision doubles the available time period.The tax authorities have streamlined the process of calculating annual house value for taxation purposes. This revision enables straightforward income tax filing by allowing nil value declaration for any two properties.The authorities have modified the annual value definition for self-occupied properties, providing clarity to homeowners whilst maintaining the existing two-property restriction.Beginning April 1, 2025, tax officials will conduct comparative analyses between current and previous Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to identify inconsistencies. This provision takes effect from April 1, 2025. Whilst the implementation date is confirmed, the tax authority has not yet detailed which specific discrepancies they will examine across both ITRs.Also Read | How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay?

EPFO to increase auto settlement limit to 5 lakhs for PF claims and allow UPI withdrawals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-to-increase-auto-settlement-limit-to-5-lakhs-for-pf-claims-and-allow-upi-withdrawals/articleshow/119812227.cms,"Representative image

Auto settlement claims

UPI withdrawals for PF members

The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The move is designed to enhance the 'ease of living' for its 7.5 crore members, sources told news agency ANI.According to sources, Sumita Dawra, Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, approved the proposal during the 113th meeting of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, on March 28.“This revision will enhance the ease of living for crores of our members,” Dawra said in a statement. Following this approval, the recommendation will be forwarded for final approval by the CBT. Once approved, EPFO members will be able to withdraw up to Rs 5 lakh through the auto-settlement process.EPFO’s auto-settlement process has seen tremendous growth, processing a record 2.16 crore auto-claims as of March 6, 2025, compared to just 89.52 lakh claims in the previous year. This reflects the increasing efficiency of the system, with 95% of claims now being settled automatically within three days.“The auto-settlement process has greatly simplified claim settlements, significantly reducing the time and human intervention required,” said Ramesh Krishnamurthi, Central Provident Fund Commissioner. “We are committed to making the process more efficient, and with the increasing number of automated claims, our goal is to make accessing PF funds easier for all members.”Additionally, EPFO has expanded the categories for which advance claims can be settled automatically, now covering illness, education, marriage, housing, and more. The system’s improvements have also led to a reduction in the rejection rate of claims, from 50% last year to just 30% this year.In another game-changing development, EPFO will soon allow Provident Fund (PF) withdrawals through Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has given approval for the plan, and members will be able to access their funds through UPI and ATMs by the end of May or June 2025.“This new system will make it even more convenient for members to access their PF savings instantly through UPI and ATMs,” Dawra said. “It is a groundbreaking move that will set a precedent for other government savings schemes, like the General Provident Fund (GPF) for government employees and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) for bank customers.”The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has recently streamlined its auto-settlement process, leading to a significant reduction in claim processing time—from several weeks to just three days. As a result, EPFO's claim settlements are expected to surpass 6 crore for the first time. The number of members utilizing the auto-settlement feature has more than doubled, rising from just under 90 lakh last fiscal year to nearly 2 crore this year.Currently, only 8% of transfer claims require attestation from both the member and employer, while 48% are submitted directly by members, and 44% are processed automatically. EPFO has already reduced its procedural steps from 27 to 18, with plans to further streamline the process to just six steps.","The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

Top stock market recommendations:Having rallied nearly 1900 points from its 9 month low in March, Nifty has now retraced 38.2% of this move on Fibonacci retracement scale. Given the price action on Nifty this week, it could well retrace 50% of this whole 1900 point rally on account of jitters on the tariff news which would hit Indian markets on Thursday early hours. The index continues to hold above the 6 month trendline breakout seen on weekly charts and this pullback is just a retesting of the same. The broader trend remains buy on dip and levels of 24000 could be soon seen by the end of this month. Markets are nervous ahead of the tariff implementation as well as the RBI MPC meeting next week. For now the 22900 -23000 zone is seen as a strong support for Nifty.In line with Nifty, Bank Nifty as well shred close to 1.5% in Tuesday’s session but staged a comeback in Wednesday’s session. Bank Nifty has retested its 200DMA sub 51000 mark after completing its initial targets at 51650 which we had highlighted last week. The index has been leaning forwards in counts of - one step back and two step forward. Any dips between 49900 and 50400 are likely to get bought into for a strong up move towards 52500, given the outperforming stance of the index against Nifty for the past 6 months. Bank Nifty is down less than 4% v/s a drop of 10% on Nifty in the past 6 months.Computer Age Management Services stock has bounced over 25% from its recent lows printed in March 2025. The price action suggests that the ongoing 2 week sideways consolidation is nearing an end and an upside resumption is on cards paving way for a bullish flag breakout formation. Given the strong bounce back from its low, stock is likely to extend its rally northwards by 10-12% after the breakout above 3800.Higher high, higher low formation seen on charts of PCBL with the stock sustaining above its recent dynamic resistance plotted on the 200 DMA. Scrip has given a fresh momentum breakout as it has closed above the resistance of 430 created by a downward sloping trendline. A quick 6-8% move can unfold from the current set up at which the stock holds.With stock breaking above its 200 DMA resistance in the last fortnight, Balrampur Chini Mills has also given a breakout above sloping trendline resistance confirming a flag pattern breakout on daily charts. The consolidation above its 200 DMA before resuming the move forward confirms the presence of buyers for an anticipated up move towards 600 odd in the next couple of trading days.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, PCBL Chemical, and Balrampur Chini Mills are the top buy calls for today.

Reciprocal tariffs on countries: See full list

Q: What exactly has Donald Trump announced on tariffs?

A:

A universal 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods into the United States, which came into effect on April 5.

A second, more targeted set of “reciprocal tariffs” ranging from 10% to 50%, which will be applied to about 60 countries starting April 9.

Q: Which countries are most affected by the new reciprocal tariffs?

A:

China: A total tariff of 54%, combining a 20% fentanyl-linked levy with a new 34% tariff

India: Slapped with a 26% tariff, despite close diplomatic ties.

Vietnam: Tariff of 46%

Cambodia: 49%

Japan: 24%

EU: 20%

South Korea: 25%

Countries like the UK, Singapore, and Brazil only face the 10% universal tariff.

Q: Why did Trump implement these tariffs now?

A:

Boosting American industry

Pressuring other nations to lower their own tariffs

Generating revenue to replace income taxes

Q: What happens to Canada and Mexico under this plan?

A:

25% tariffs on non-USMCA-compliant goods

Auto tariffs, particularly on vehicles not manufactured with a certain percentage of US-made parts

Q: What are Trump’s broader goals with these tariffs?

A:

Revive domestic manufacturing: “If you make products in America, you pay no tariffs,” Trump has repeatedly said.

Reduce the trade deficit: The US had a $918 billion goods and services deficit in 2024.

Force reciprocal trade: White House officials claim the goal is “rectifying the unfair trade practices of our foreign trading partners.”

Replace income taxes: Trump has suggested tariff revenues could fund tax cuts and reduce the national debt.

Q: How long will these tariffs last?

A:

Q: Are there any products or sectors exempt from these tariffs?

Semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, and lumber

Energy products and minerals not produced in the U.S.

Steel, aluminum, and autos already covered under previous tariffs won’t face new reciprocal levies.

Q: What does this mean for India specifically?

Lowering duties on bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson bikes

Committing to buy more US oil, LNG, and defense equipment

Promising more tariff cuts

Despite these moves, Trump went ahead with the tariffs, likely as leverage for a broader bilateral trade deal, which both sides hope to conclude this year.

FULL SPEECH: 'Looted, Plundered': Trump QUAKES Europe; Unleashes Reciprocal Tariffs On One & All

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping tariffs on global imports, a move that marks one of the boldest protectionist pushes in recent history.Trump introduced a universal baseline tariff of 10% on all imports starting April 5, with steeper levies for countries the US considers trade violators. These tariffs come on top of existing duties and are backed by emergency powers invoked under a national security pretext.The policy marks a return to aggressive tariff diplomacy, with the White House targeting countries it labels “worst offenders” based on trade deficits and non-tariff barriers. China, India, Japan, and the EU are among those slapped with sharply higher rates.Here is all you need to know about Trump tariffs:Trump introduced two layers of tariffs:Trump declared this a new phase in US trade, saying, “For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it’s our turn to prosper.”These tariffs are being imposed using emergency powers under a declared national emergency citing the US’s large and persistent trade deficits.The reciprocal tariffs are aimed at what Trump’s team calls the “worst offenders”—countries with large trade surpluses with the US or those that impose higher tariffs and non-tariff barriers on American goods. Examples include:The administration argues that persistent trade deficits are a national threat. Trump invoked emergency powers, citing a “national security and economic security” threat from trade imbalances. A senior White House official said, “The president would impose ‘baseline tariffs’ on all countries,” with higher reciprocal rates targeted at nations with discriminatory trade practices.The strategic goals include:The administration says these measures could raise “hundreds of billions of dollars in any given year.” As per a WSJ report, Capital Economics estimates that Trump tariffs could bring in up to $835 billion. However, ""assuming such high tariffs lead to a marked decline in imports, the increase in revenues will probably end up closer to $700 billion,"" they wrote in a note to clients. That would be about 2.3% of the country's GDP, they added.Canada and Mexico escape the new reciprocal tariff regime, but they’re not entirely in the clear. Both countries still face:The White House clarified that Canada and Mexico will continue under prior executive orders, mainly focused on immigration and fentanyl. Trump previously announced exemptions but warned these are subject to change.Trump has multiple ambitions:In essence, Trump sees tariffs not just as trade tools but as economic weapons to reshape the global economic order.There is no expiration date. The executive order allows the president to adjust the tariffs based on foreign compliance. It states duties may be reduced if countries “take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements.”But the White House emphasized the current focus is enforcement, not negotiation. A senior official said, “Certainly, countries are very interested in trying to see what they can do to have more reciprocal trade. For the moment, we are very, very focused on getting the tariff regime in place.”Retaliation from other nations could lead to further escalation.A: Yes, several sectors are temporarily shielded:However, the White House has launched new investigations that could bring some of these products under future tariffs, especially pharmaceuticals and computer chips.India is one of the biggest targets of this round, hit with a 26% tariff—more than Japan (24%) and the EU (20%). Trump said, “India, very, very tough. Very, very tough,” adding that despite Modi being a “friend,” India charges the US “52%.”India had tried to avoid the tariffs through concessions:The commerce ministry is reviewing the impact of the 26 percent reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US on India, PTI reported, quoting a senior government official.""The ministry is analyzing the impact of the announced tariffs,"" the official said. They added that if a country addresses the concerns raised by the US, the Trump administration may consider reducing the duties for that nation.""It is a mixed bag and not a setback for India,"" the official said.The announcement sparked a sharp decline in stock markets, especially among multinational firms exposed to global trade.“US stock-index futures declined between 2% and 4.3% in after-hours trading,” and stocks like Apple, Amazon, and Nike fell more than 4%.Auto companies and manufacturers with international supply chains were hit especially hard. Analysts warn the move could stoke inflation by raising the cost of imported goods.Mary Lovely, a fellow at the Peterson Institute, said the tariffs were “much worse than we feared” and warned of “huge implications for rerouting of trade globally.”Countries hit by these tariffs are weighing countermeasures. Brazil is pushing legislation to retaliate without WTO arbitration. Canada has already imposed C$60 billion in counter-tariffs and threatened more. India may fast-track trade negotiations to win exemptions or relief.But Trump warned, “Any retaliation by countries to the measures announced on Wednesday would be met with more levies from the US.”In short, the world may be headed toward a new phase of trade conflict, potentially undermining the global order that has governed trade since World War II.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping tariffs on global imports.

US attorney general Pam Bondi on Tuesday directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione , the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside a New York City hotel on December 4, 2024.Mangione, 26, is facing both federal and state murder charges in connection with the high-profile killing that shocked the business world and intensified criticism of the health insurance industry .The federal indictment includes charges of murder through the use of a firearm, which carries the possibility of capital punishment. The state charges, which will likely go to trial first, carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, reported the news agency AP.“Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson, an innocent man and father of two young children, was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Bondi said in a statement.“After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again”, the statement added.Mangione was arrested on December 9 at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after allegedly shooting Thompson outside the New York Hilton Midtown. Prosecutors said he was found with a firearm matching the murder weapon and a fake ID.A notebook in his possession reportedly contained entries expressing hostility toward health insurance executives, with one from August 2024 stating that “the target is insurance” and another from October detailing a plan to “wack” an insurance company CEO, according to The Guardian.Surveillance footage showed the gunman fleeing the crime scene on a bicycle and disappearing into Central Park before the manhunt ended with Mangione’s arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to state charges and has yet to enter a plea in the federal case.Thompson, 50, was on his way to an investor conference when he was ambushed and shot. UnitedHealthcare, the largest health insurer in the US, confirmed that Mangione was never a client.The case also carries political implications. US President Donald Trump, who resumed office in January, signed an executive order reinstating the federal death penalty on his first day back.This reversed a moratorium put in place by his predecessor, Joe Biden.Mangione’s defense team has not commented on the decision to seek capital punishment. His legal expenses are being supported by approximately $775,000 raised on the GiveSendGo platform, through a campaign organized by a group called the December 4th Legal Committee, reported The Guardian.","Luigi Mangione, 26, is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

LIVE: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs

Donald Trump has unveiled sweeping new tariffs on imports, targeting a range of global economies but notably omitting Russia and North Korea from the list. The move, announced in a dramatic White House Rose Garden event, has sparked concerns over an escalating trade war .Speaking against a backdrop of American flags, Trump declared the tariffs a necessary step to protect US industries, calling the day ""Liberation Day."" The new measures include a 34% tariff on goods from China, 20% on the European Union, and 24% on Japan, with a general 10% baseline tariff for most other nations, including Britain. Trump framed the move as a way to reverse decades of economic exploitation, stating, ""For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.""However, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus were not included in the tariffs. A White House official, speaking anonymously to the New York Times, explained that these countries were excluded because they already face ""extremely high tariffs and our previously imposed sanctions preclude any meaningful trade with these countries.""The announcement triggered immediate backlash. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese denounced the tariffs as ""totally unwarranted,"" while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, despite her ties to Trump, called them ""wrong."" The European Union has vowed retaliation, with officials warning of countermeasures that could affect US exports.Wall Street reacted sharply to the news. The S&P index dropped 1.5% in after-hours trading, while the dollar initially fell against the euro before recovering. Businesses in the US have also raised concerns that the tariffs could lead to higher prices for consumers and trigger a broader economic slowdown.Trump’s stance on tariffs has long been a cornerstone of his economic policy. He insists that such measures will bring a ""rebirth"" of American manufacturing and encourage companies to relocate to the US ""This is Liberation Day,"" he declared, claiming that the tariffs would ""make America wealthy again.""Key allies, however, are seeking ways to mitigate the impact. Britain, which faces a 10% tariff, launched a diplomatic effort, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer personally delivering an invitation from King Charles III for a state visit. Meanwhile, business leaders in affected nations are scrambling to assess the full ramifications of the new trade barriers.","US President Donald Trump announces sweeping new tariffs on imports.

Will Trump’s tariffs trigger another market sell-off? FIIs cash out stir worries investors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-trumps-tariffs-trigger-another-market-sell-off-fiis-cash-out-stir-worries-investors/articleshow/119912682.cms,"AI generated image

What’s behind the

FII sell-off

?

Opportunity amid the fear

Should you be buying now?

What began as a strong rally in March is now showing signs of uncertainty. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), who played a major role in driving a 6% rally in the Nifty throughout March, have sold off Rs 10,255 crore worth of Indian stocks in recent trading sessions.The sell-off comes just before US President Donald Trump ’s highly anticipated Liberation Day tariff announcements.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, notes that while today’s tariff declaration may reduce some uncertainty around reciprocal tariffs, the unpredictability of Trump’s past decisions suggests that the uncertainty could persist well beyond today.FIIs had turned aggressive buyers toward the end of March, likely driven by end-of-year considerations. Their buying spree triggered short-covering, which contributed to India’s outperformance. However, with the market's direction shifting, FIIs are now resuming short positions.According to an ET report, Vijayakumar advises investors to wait for more clarity on tariffs and market trends. If the tariffs are worse than expected, there could be further sell-offs, though domestic consumption-driven sectors are expected to remain resilient in such a scenario.Jahangir Aziz from JPMorgan warns that India may not be spared from reciprocal tariffs. Even if India avoids these, sector-specific tariffs could still be a risk. He highlights two additional concerns: the potential for a global risk-off event and its impact on the dollar. If US equities suffer, history suggests that global markets, including India, will not remain unaffected.Market expert Sunil Subramaniam views the current volatility as short-term pain with potential for medium-term gain. He believes that much of the price correction is already priced in, in anticipation of bad news. Unless there is a surprise sector-specific tariff, Subramaniam suggests that the worst may already be priced in. He recommends a staggered investment approach over the next six months, advising investors not to try to pick sectors or stocks at this moment—comparing it to “catching a falling knife.”Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Group Chairman of Inditrade Capital, acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the markets. “The April 2 tariff announcement is creating significant psychological pressure. There’s a lot of speculation and mixed signals coming from the US It’s difficult to predict what will happen, which is why many investors are staying light ahead of the event.”Bandyopadhyay also sees opportunity in the midst of this uncertainty. “There are several strong stocks experiencing corrections due to this unpredictability, making it a great time for building a long-term portfolio. Don’t invest all your funds today, but begin to allocate slowly. Large-cap and mid-cap stocks are trading at more attractive valuations compared to where they might be in September 2024.”The verdict is still out on whether the current correction is a golden opportunity or the start of further pain. According to the ET report, analysts agree that while near-term uncertainty will persist, investors with a long-term outlook can start deploying capital gradually.Vijayakumar remains cautiously optimistic, noting that India’s economic fundamentals are still strong. While near-term volatility may be influenced by global factors, domestic demand continues to remain robust.Bandyopadhyay echoes this sentiment, suggesting that it’s impossible to predict how the global markets or India’s markets will react once the tariffs are announced. “We’ll likely get a clearer picture when the market opens after the announcement. So while uncertainty is high, it’s still a good time to start putting money to work.”Meanwhile, Aziz points out that India’s real challenge lies not just in tariffs, but in how global monetary policy unfolds. “If there’s a global slowdown or a risk-off event, emerging markets like India will need the ability to respond with rate cuts,” he says.With FIIs turning net sellers once again, the direction of the market now hinges on Trump’s upcoming tariff decision. Will it be a minor setback or a major blow? Either way, investors should brace for volatility and carefully evaluate their investment strategy .","FIIs had turned aggressive buyers toward the end of March, likely driven by end- of-year considerations.

What are reciprocal tariffs, and who pays them?

Economic and political fallout

US President Donald Trump is set to announce sweeping new ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on Thursday, a move he claims will boost domestic manufacturing and punish unfair trade practices. However, economists warn that the measures could damage the US economy, strain global alliances, and lead to higher consumer costs .""April 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern American history,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday, adding that the tariffs would take effect immediately. The new levies target a wide range of imports, including automobiles, steel, aluminium, pharmaceuticals, and computer chips. Trump has also imposed tariffs on nations importing oil from Venezuela and hinted at broader future measures.Despite concerns over economic downturns and declining consumer sentiment, the administration remains confident. Trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested the tariffs could generate $600 billion annually—the largest tax increase since World War II. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the tariffs might be negotiable, but the White House has yet to confirm details.Reciprocal tariffs are import taxes imposed on foreign goods to match the tariffs those countries place on American exports. Trump has long insisted that foreign nations bear the cost of these levies, but in reality, importers—mostly US companies—pay them. These costs are typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.Tariffs are intended to protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, thus encouraging local production. However, they often provoke retaliation. The European Union, for example, responded to Trump’s previous tariffs on steel and aluminium by imposing taxes on US products, including bourbon and motorcycles. China, too, has targeted American exports like soybeans and pork.Despite Trump’s claims that tariffs will create jobs, previous measures have had mixed results. A study by economists from MIT, Harvard, and the World Bank found that Trump’s first-term tariffs did not significantly boost US employment. While tariffs on imported steel were meant to protect American jobs, employment in the steel industry remained stagnant at around 140,000 workers.Democratic lawmakers argue that Trump’s tariffs serve primarily to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the measures ""a smokescreen for tax breaks that disproportionately benefit billionaires."" Even some Republicans acknowledge the potential economic turbulence, with House Speaker Mike Johnson admitting, ""It may be rocky in the beginning.""Economists predict a significant impact on American households. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that a 20% universal tariff would cost the average household an additional $3,400 to $4,200 per year. Trump argues that the policy will revitalise manufacturing and reduce the federal deficit, but many remain sceptical.","US President Donald Trump is set to announce sweeping new ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on Thursday.

Global stock markets, including those in the US and Europe, fell sharply on Wednesday as uncertainty loomed ahead of US President Donald Trump 's highly anticipated tariff announcement , raising fears of a potential global trade war , according to news agency AFP.Investors are on edge as Trump prepares to unveil a new wave of tariffs, known as "" Liberation Day ,"" which could impact both allies and adversaries. With speculations about retaliatory tariffs and the potential escalation of trade tensions, market sentiment has been fragile. The dollar and oil prices both slipped, while gold, often seen as a safe haven, approached its all-time high.Following a slight uptick in Tokyo and steadying Chinese markets, European stocks dropped, with Frankfurt leading the losses. The decline continued on Wall Street after opening, further exacerbating investor anxieties.Joshua Mahony, an analyst at Scope Markets, highlighted the heightened uncertainty in the markets, with traders weighing the possible economic impact of a full-blown trade conflict. Trump's comments about years of ""ripping off"" the United States have added to concerns that both friendly and adversarial nations might be caught in the crossfire of the tariffs.The uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff plans has been exacerbated by conflicting reports about the details of the measures. Initial suggestions indicated that tariffs would match those imposed by other countries, but reports have since emerged that Trump may impose blanket 20% tariffs or provide preferential treatment to certain countries.One of the major fears is the immediate effect of the new 25% auto tariffs set to go into effect on Thursday. Trump's planned announcement, which will take place after Wall Street closes, is expected to provide clarity on the situation but also further fuel concerns about global economic growth and inflation.Tesla, which has become a significant stock in global markets, saw its shares plummet by 5% after it reported a 13% drop in first-quarter auto sales. Contributing to this decline were factors such as lower production due to factory upgrades and growing dissatisfaction among customers related to CEO Elon Musk 's involvement with the Trump administration.","Global stock markets fell sharply on Wednesday as uncertainty loomed ahead of US President Donald Trump's highly anticipated tariff announcement.

US stocks faced significant swings Wednesday afternoon, as Wall Street waited for President Donald Trump’s highly anticipated announcement on tariffs, which could drastically reshape global trade and the economy.The S&P 500 was down 0.3% in morning trading, recovering slightly from an earlier 1.1% drop. This pattern of sharp early losses followed by a late-day rally has been common this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 140 points, or 0.3%, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.2%, according to news agency AP.Tesla played a significant role in pulling the market lower after reporting fewer electric vehicle deliveries in Q1 compared to last year, with its stock falling 2.2%, extending its 2025 loss to 35%. Tesla has been facing mounting criticism, partly due to CEO Elon Musk’s involvement in US government spending cuts.Investors around the world are particularly nervous ahead of Trump’s announcement, with concerns mounting over how his tariff plans could impact global economies, especially as inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve’s target. Though the tariffs might aim to make the global system more “fair,” there is still much uncertainty about what will be unveiled, such as the size and scope of the tariffs, which countries will be affected, and which goods will be targeted.Despite the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s upcoming announcement, some market observers, like Kurt Reiman of UBS Global Wealth Management, suggest that peak tariff uncertainty could be nearing its end.Beyond tariffs, there are growing fears that the unpredictable rollout of Trump's trade policy could discourage consumer and business spending, potentially stalling economic growth.On a more positive note, a report from ADP Research showed stronger-than-expected job growth in March, which could signal resilience in theUS labor market ahead of Friday’s official employment report.Despite that positive news, Treasury yields fell, reflecting ongoing concerns about the potential economic impact of tariffs. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 4.14%, from 4.17% the day before, continuing its downward trend from early January.As for the stock market, Newsmax shares saw a dramatic 36.3% drop in their third day of trading, reversing the massive gains made earlier in the week.In global markets, European indexes fell, following mixed performances in Asia.","The S&P 500 was down 0.3% in morning trading, recovering slightly from an earlier 1.1% drop.

Tesla's stock performance

Tesla 's sales fell in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 13% drop and indicating potential challenges ahead for the electric vehicle giant, according to news agency AP.The decline, which saw global deliveries fall to 336,681 units in the January-March period, down from 387,000 during the same period last year, is attributed to a combination of factors, including an aging vehicle line-up, increased competition, and backlash from CEO Elon Musk 's embrace of right-wing politics.Despite offering deep discounts, zero financing, and other incentives, Tesla still fell short of analysts’ expectations, in which FactSet expected much higher deliveries of 408,000.Tesla's electric car sales in Europe have seen significant drops, with March figures showing a 36.8 percent decline in France, according to data from the Automotive Platform (PFA). The overall electric vehicle market in France also experienced a slight dip during the same period, news agency AFP reported.In Sweden, Tesla sales plunged by 63.9 percent in March and 55.2 percent for the first quarter of the year, according to Mobility Sweden.Notably, the Tesla Model Y, which was the top-selling car in Sweden during the first quarter of 2024, has now fallen behind two Volvos, the luxury Volkswagen ID.7, and a Subaru in sales. Similarly, Tesla's sales in Denmark dropped by 56 percent in the first quarter, according to Mobility Denmark. Figures for March sales in Germany, Britain, and Italy will be released in the coming days.Tesla's stock has plummeted by about 50% since hitting a record high in mid-December, as initial expectations of lighter regulation and significant profits under a Donald Trump presidency have been replaced by growing concerns over protests against CEO Elon Musk and other issues potentially hurting the company.Analysts remain uncertain about the exact impact of these protests on sales, as the overall electric vehicle ( EV ) market has also been sluggish. Tesla, in particular, is facing challenges as potential buyers hold off on purchasing its best-selling Model Y, anticipating an updated version later this year.Moreover, Tesla has lost market share to increasing competition, with rivals like BYD gaining ground. The Chinese EV leader recently unveiled technology enabling its cars to charge in just a few minutes, further intensifying the pressure on Tesla.Tesla’s shares dropped more than 4% before the market opened on Wednesday.","Tesla's global deliveries fell to 336,681 units in the January-March period, down from 387,000 during the same period last year.

According to a Financial Times report that is based on econometric study by Aston University, a worst-case global retaliation to Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs could hammer the world economy with a $1.4 trillion income hit and cripple global trade.

The research models six escalating scenarios based on bilateral trade data from 132 countries, showing how a tit-for-tat tariff spiral would move from North America to Europe and beyond — destabilizing supply chains and inflating prices.

As per a Washington Post report, White House adviser Peter Navarro said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s new tariffs would generate more than $6 trillion in federal revenue over the next ten years — a projection that, if realized, would amount to the largest peacetime tax increase in modern US history, according to experts.

Speaking on Fox News, Navarro said the tariffs on auto imports would bring in $100 billion annually. He added that a broader set of still-unspecified tariffs would yield an additional $600 billion per year, totaling $6 trillion over the next decade.

Why it matters

Trump’s advisers argue the economic pain is worth it. They envision a future where American factories hum again, imports shrink, and tariff revenue funds a new era of domestic tax cuts.

“Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American Dream,” said treasury secretary Scott Bessent. “The dream is rooted in upward mobility and economic security.”

But investors and economists aren’t convinced. The S&P 500 dropped 4.6% in Q1, its worst start since 2022.

Goldman Sachs increased the probability of a US recession to 35%, up from 20%.

US allies, including Canada, Japan, and Germany, have warned the White House that indiscriminate tariffs could spark retaliatory spirals and damage global growth.

“This is going to be much bigger than Smoot-Hawley,” said economic historian Douglas Irwin. “Imports are a much greater share of GDP now than they were in the early 1930s.”

We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years. They’ve taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. Donald Trump

US exports fall over 46%, triggering steep domestic inflation of more than 5%.

Living standards decline globally, especially in countries heavily dependent on US trade.

Bloomberg Economics estimates US GDP could shrink by 4% if tariffs are widely imposed and retaliated. Prices could jump 2.5% over 2–3 years, hurting consumer purchasing power.

India, the UK, Japan, and South Korea could benefit temporarily — but only if escalation remains moderate.

In short: India might catch a breeze in the early gusts, but it won’t escape the storm.

What’s next?

The bottom line

On April 2, in a Rose Garden ceremony, US President Donald Trump will declare “Liberation Day.” But instead of freeing the economy, the tariffs he plans to unveil could slam the brakes on global growth, ignite inflation, and throw the world into an economic tailspin.Trump’s plan — targeting countries that impose higher tariffs on US goods — could significantly reshape the global economic order. According to the FT report, the research conducted by economists at Aston University explores how a cycle of retaliatory tariffs triggers intricate changes in global trade, initially impacting North America—specifically the US, Mexico, and Canada—before extending to Europe and eventually affecting the rest of the world.While a few nations like India may reap modest gains from diverted trade, the bigger picture is grim:India’s strategic opportunity—and its limitsIndia appears, on paper, to be one of the few countries with something to gain. In scenarios where trade patterns shift to avoid US-EU or US-China tariff barriers, India, along with the UK, Japan, and South Korea, could benefit modestly from trade diversion. These countries might see increased demand for exports in sectors where the US previously relied on more tariff-encumbered suppliers.For India, the opportunity lies in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles—sectors already being nurtured under the “Make in India” initiative. The country’s growing reputation as a manufacturing alternative to China, along with a neutral position outside major trade blocs like the EU, could position it as a go-to supplier in a time of uncertainty.But the gains are marginal. And fleeting.“India might benefit from a few supply chain shifts,” said a senior economist at a New Delhi-based think tank, “but if the global trade environment turns volatile, capital flows will become unstable, inflation will rise, and the ripple effects will catch up.”Indeed, India imports much of its energy, machinery, and high-end components. A broad-based trade war would make many of these imports more expensive. That would stoke inflation and squeeze the government’s fiscal room. The Reserve Bank of India, already cautious due to sticky food prices, might be forced to tighten policy—potentially dampening growth.Back to the future?Interestingly, Trump’s renewed tariff push comes at a time when the US economy is more reliant on imports than ever before. Its imports now account for roughly 14–16% of US GDP — a figure nearly triple what it was during the protectionist Smoot-Hawley era of the 1930s. This underscores how deeply integrated the US is in global supply chains today. A return to aggressive tariffs, like those Trump is proposing, risks shocking a system built on decades of liberalized trade policy, a Bloomberg report said.Next, if fully implemented, his ""reciprocal tariff"" strategy would drive US average tariff levels on goods up to around 35%—the highest since the late 1800s. This would far surpass even the levels seen during the infamous Smoot-Hawley period, which historians widely blame for deepening the Great Depression. Trump's plan would reintroduce trade barriers at a scale unseen in over a century, despite a modern economy far more exposed to international commerce.The contrast between the two charts paints a stark picture: while the structure of the US economy has evolved to depend heavily on imports, Trump's proposed trade policy appears rooted in an era when international trade was minimal. Economists warn this disconnect could fuel inflation, disrupt industries, and lead to retaliation that hobbles both global and domestic growth.Trump’s long-promised “Liberation Day” speech will be watched for three key details:Universal or reciprocal? The White House remains split.Sectoral carveouts? Automobiles, steel, pharma, and semiconductors are in focus.Duration and flexibility. Will tariffs be negotiable or fixed for the long term?Inside the West Wing, factions are pushing different approaches. Some advocate a hard 20% universal tariff to send a signal. Others want a flexible structure to open room for bilateral negotiations.“With Trump, it’s all a negotiation,” said Sen. James Lankford. “This is like a kitchen remodel.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite just closed their worst quarter in years, hammered by investor anxiety over President Donald Trump ’s escalating tariff agenda. The S&P 500 dropped 4.6%, its steepest quarterly loss since Q3 2022, while the Nasdaq plummeted 10.5%, its worst showing since Q2 2022, a Reuters report said.The downturn capped a bruising March for equities, marking their biggest monthly drop since December 2022.“Investors, more or less in this first quarter, threw their hands in the air, as you really cannot trade around this,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.Once market darlings, tech giants led the retreat. Tesla plunged nearly 36% in Q1, and Nvidia dropped close to 20%. The pullback in growth stocks dragged the Nasdaq lower and weighed on S&P 500 performance.“Our big lesson from the first quarter is diversification is not dead,” said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. “If you avoided the perils of market concentration, you actually held up quite a bit better versus some of the headline indexes.”Despite losses in tech-heavy sectors, more than half of the S&P 500's 11 sectors posted gains.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.
